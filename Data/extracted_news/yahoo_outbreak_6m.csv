Routine childhood vaccines are now optional in the United States, and government officials, after hastily compiling an immense research registry of autistic people, have added the neurodevelopmental condition to the list of compensable vaccine injuries, thereby opening up vaccine makers to an onslaught of lawsuits. Facing decreased demand and increased litigation, some vaccine makers have pulled their shots from the domestic market entirely. Outbreaks are spreading across the country, sickening tens of thousands of people; too many are dying, especially children, pregnant people, and older adults. Something similar is unfolding around the world because the U.S. government ended vaccinations for millions globally.

This is one scenario America faces if we continue down the path being bushwhacked by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other anti-vaccine activists at the Department of Health and Human Services. And when I called up vaccine experts to ask whether my dystopian fears made me a doomer, they agreed that this grim scenario was plausible—and that it could get even worse.

Every day seems to bring more ominous news about Kennedy’s war on vaccines. Within just the past few weeks, Kennedy has done the following: He abruptlyfiredall 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP, and replaced them with largely inexperienced people, some of who are outright anti-vaccine activists—who then promptly voted to ban thimerosal, a rare but safe preservative, from flu vaccines. Hechanged CDC recommendationsso that they no longer say healthy children and pregnant people should receive Covid-19 vaccines. And heannouncedthe U.S. would stop funding Gavi, an international organization that vaccinates children around the world.

“It’s hard to know how this is all going to play out. But right now, everything appears very dark,” said Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. And yet, he added, “I don’t think we’ve hit bottom. I think he’s continuing to chip away, with some pretty big chips, to erode our vaccine ecosystem. I don’t see a turnaround at this point. We’re still in free fall as far as I’m concerned.”

I’m not the first to try to gaze into a crystal ball about the future of vaccines in America. In January 2025, at Kennedy’s confirmation hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren began rattling off the actions he could take as secretary, given his history ofprofitingfrom lawsuits against vaccine makers:

You could publish your anti-vaccine conspiracies, but this time on U.S. government letterhead, something a jury might be impressed by. You could appoint people to the CDC vaccine panel who share your anti-vax views and let them do your dirty work. You could tell the CDC vaccine panel to remove a particular vaccine from the vaccine schedule. You could remove vaccines from special compensation programs, which would open up manufacturers to mass torts. You could make more injuries eligible for compensation, even if there is no causal evidence. You could change vaccine court processes to make it easier to bring junk lawsuits. You could turn over FDA data to your friends at the law firm, and they could use it however it benefited them. You could change vaccine labeling, you could change vaccine information rules, you could change which claims are compensated in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

The bottom line, Warren added: “Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it. Kids might die. But Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.”

Sure enough, some of this has come to pass. In an Xvideoin May, Kennedy announced that the CDC was changing its recommendations for the Covid vaccine. The agency turned the childhood recommendation from “should” to “may” and called the process “shared clinical decision-making,” while eliminating the recommendation entirely for pregnant people, who are at significantly higher risk for severe illness and death.

I asked the experts: Could other vaccine recommendations be softened like this? “I think it’s a real possibility—I think in many ways it’s a goal,” said Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint for the second Trump administration, specifically called for eliminating the CDC as a recommending body. If a vaccine is no longer recommended, “that means that it couldn’t be required for school entry.” (School mandates have long been a target of anti-vaccine activists.)

Others thought it might be even worse. “[Kennedy’s] end goal is to remove most or all childhood vaccines—to make them inaccessible, is my view,” said Dorit Reiss, professor at UC Hastings College of Law. “So your scenario is plausible, although you’re being very cautious in saying they might move to shared clinical decision-making. They could say ‘this is no longer recommended.’” The new ACIP advisers could stop recommending some vaccines entirely: HPV, influenza, and hepatitis B shots have all been targeted by anti-vaccine activists. They could also vote to end Vaccines for Children, a $5 billion program covering the vaccinations of nearly half of all children in the United States.

The administration may also make it difficult to approve new vaccines. “It’s not only about Kennedy’s insistence on saline placebos,” Hotez said, referring to the health secretary’sannouncementin May that vaccines would need to go through new, unethical clinical trials involving placebo tests. “There’s so little vaccine expertise now, either at FDA because people seem to be leaving, and with ACIP, there’s almost no vaccine expertise in its current group.”

And, of course, there’s the harm that figures like Kennedy do with public advocacy against vaccines. That includes the ACIP advisers’ recommendation on Thursday to remove thimerosal, a preservative used only in multidose vials of flu vaccines—about 4 percent of all flu vaccines given in the U.S.—in order to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. Thimerosal was removed from all other childhood vaccines in 2001 as a precaution when anti-vaccine activists first began linking it to autism—a connection that multiple studies have disproven. Banning it entirely now could undermine American’s sense of vaccines’ safety and necessity.

In June, Health and Human Services awarded $150,000 to the Arizona law firm Brueckner Spitler Shelts for its legal “expertise” on the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which is run by the Health Resources and Services Administration, a subagency of HHS. Drew Downing, a lawyer at the firm, has areputationfor representing people who say they’ve been injured by vaccines, and he has been involved in lawsuits against vaccine makers. Several of the new advisers on ACIP have also served as expert witnesses in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies.

“I think [Kennedy’s] goal is to either remove vaccines from the vaccine injury compensation program or add to the list of compensable injuries, all of which will weaken the vaccine infrastructure,” Offit said. Autism, for example, could be added to the list of injuries based on the administration’s fast-tracked research to find a link between the condition and vaccines, despite decades of scientific research showing otherwise. Changes to the compensation program could mean vaccine makers simply choose to stop making shots available in the U.S., Offit said: “Make vaccines expensive enough, or make them more subject to frivolous litigation, and they’ll leave.”

Something similar has happened before. In 1980, 18 companies made vaccines; by 1990, that number had fallen to four. A 1981 studysuggestedthat the whole-cell pertussis component of the DTP vaccine could in rare cases cause permanent brain swelling. Subsequent studies found no such link; in fact, the swelling was caused by infant epilepsy. Even so, litigation against pertussis vaccine makers and then manufacturers of all vaccines began to mount, causing vaccine prices to skyrocket and pushing some manufacturers out of business. Faced with a volatile vaccine market, Congress passed a law in 1986 leading to the creation of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

“If you really want to hurt vaccines, mess with the vaccination compensation program,” Offit said. After all, vaccines aren’t usually a big payday for pharmaceutical companies, he said. “They make money on things that you give frequently. They don’t make as much money as things that you give once or a few times in a lifetime.”

The vaccine market is big, but for pharmaceutical companies, “vaccines are still a very modest component of their revenue compared to all the small molecule drugs that they’re producing,” said Hotez. Facing litigation, companies might decide vaccine production isn’t worth it. “If it becomes untenable for them to remain in the U.S. market, they may just pull the plug on their vaccine side altogether.”

If the measles vaccination rate declines by 10 percent, 11.1 million people will contract measles within 25 years, according to a newstudycoauthored by Hotez. Other vaccine-preventable diseases would also come roaring back. The resulting illnesses and deaths would be “absolutely devastating,” he said.

But this isn’t just a future fear. Outbreaks are already cropping up: 2025 has already been one of theworst years for measlesin decades; whooping cough cases increasedsixfoldbetween 2023 and 2024; polio wasdetectedin wastewater in 2022. “Things are already starting to fray,” Hotez said. “Measles is the first one you see break through, because it’s so highly contagious, but the others will follow. I worry about pertussis. I worry about bringing back things like Hib meningitis, which I used to take care of as a pediatric resident. And I even worry about polio coming back.”

But outbreaks tend to underline the importance of vaccines, increasing their importance among the public. “As outbreaks grow, we will see people clamoring for vaccines. Remember that most people still vaccinate their children,” Reiss said. Most parents—91 percent—believe vaccines are safe for most children, according to a newpollfrom the opinion research program at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“People want to vaccinate their children,” Offit said. He believes we won’t reach a scenario where vaccination rates drop low enough for widespread outbreaks. “We won’t let it get that far,” he said. “I have to believe the federal government will step in.”Hotez agreed:“Ultimately it’s going to come down to the White House.”

After all, outbreaks wouldn’t be seen as solely the fault of top officials like Kennedy, Reiss said:“Outbreaks are not going to be limited to the ‘Kennedy outbreaks’ or the ‘HHS outbreaks,’ they’re going to be the Trump outbreaks. So I don’t know how much Trump is willing to give Kennedy leeway when polio or diphtheria starts coming back.”

Regardless, much damage has already been done, and Kennedy has only been on the job for less than five months.“It will take decades, not years, to fix the damage,” said Reiss. Kennedy and other officials “essentially took a machete to our public health institutions, and fixing that and rebuilding trust is going to take a while.” Yet there are no signs the damage is ending or that reprieve is coming, she said. “We’re in trouble.”"

There have been 1,267 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday.Texasconfirmed three more measles cases this week tied to a major outbreak that raged through the late winter and spring.

There are three otherlarge outbreaksin North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in2,212 casesfrom mid-October through June 24. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.

Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened1,169 as of Wednesday. And theMexican state of Chihuahuahad 2,810 measles cases and eight deaths as of Wednesday, according to data from the state health ministry.

Other U.S.states with active outbreaks— which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa,Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah.

In the U.S.,two elementary school-aged childrenin theepicenter in West Texasand anadult in New Mexicohave died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.

Central Kentucky has an outbreak of four cases, the state announced Monday. The cases are in Fayette County, which includes Lexington, and neighboring Woodford County. The state has confirmed seven total cases this year.

Measlesis caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It ispreventable through vaccinesand has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.

The national average for a gallon of gas on Thursday stood at $3.16, which amounts to a nearly 10% decline from a year ago,AAAdata showed. Gas prices dropped in recent weeks as crude oil erased a spike set off by the outbreak of war in the Middle East.

Twenty states boast average gas prices below $3, spanning from New Mexico to Missouri to South Carolina. Mississippi, the state with the nation's lowest gas prices, offers drivers an average gallon for $2.71.

MORE: 4th of July travel likely to shatter records: What to expect

More than 61 million people areexpected to travelby car over the July 4 holiday, AAA forecasted.

""The lower gasoline prices provide welcome relief for travelers,"" Timothy Fitzgerald, a professor of business economics at the University of Tennessee who studies the petroleum industry, told ABC News.

Cheap crude oil is the main driver of low gas prices, analysts told ABC News.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures price -- a key measure of U.S. oil prices – has plummeted more than 17% since a recent peak in January.

Oil priceshave droppedas forecasters predicted a slowdown in global economic growth, which would slash demand for oil.

Meanwhile, the alliance of oil-producing countries known as OPEC+ has increased output in recent months, boosting supply. The extra oil on the market has helped accommodate an annual surge in demand that takes hold over the summer traveling season, Aixa Diaz, a spokesperson for AAA, told ABC News.

""Most of what we pay at the pump is in direct correlation to the price of crude oil,"" Diaz said.

Crude oil prices surged as war broke out in the Middle East last month, but prices have returned to where they stood before the recent conflict between Israel and Iran.

""The resolution in the Middle East does help,"" Patrick de Haan, the head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told ABC News.

MORE: Hiring surged in June, defying concern about Trump's tariffs

President Donald Trump has touted the low gas prices on numerous occasions since he took office.

""We have everything down at levels that nobody ever thought possible,"" Trump said in a social media post in April.

Speaking at an event in Ochopee, Florida, on Monday, Trump claimed gas prices had fallen below $2 per gallon in five states.

GasBuddy, which tracks prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide, found zero locations offering gasoline below $2 per gallon, de Haan said in a post Monday onX. That remained true as of Thursday, de Haan told ABC News.

Trump could be referring to wholesale gas prices but such price levels hold little relevance since they are not paid by consumers, de Haan said.

""This does not pass the sniff test,"" de Haan added.

Gas prices will likely remain at current levels over the remainder of the summer -- and they may even drop lower, some analysts said. Gas supply typically increases over the course of the summer, alleviating price pressures, they added.

Still, prices could rise in the event of a geopolitical conflict, disruptive hurricane season or major oil refinery outages, de Haan said, adding the national average price for a gallon of gas could drop below $3 by September.

""It could happen if we don't see any of those caveats,"" de Haan said. ""If it's a normal year."""
https://www.yahoo.com/news/map-shows-more-1-100-210802851.html,2025-07-03 17:45:00,"Map shows more than 1,400 measles cases across U.S.","In 2025, the United States has recorded the mostmeasles casesin more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led tothe deathsoftwo children.

The number of cases in Texas alone grew to over760before the state declared itofficially overin August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,500, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.

Measlesis one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can causesevere infectionsin the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials saythe vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, ishighly safe and effective.

While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.

The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.

The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)

The Texas outbreak primarily affectedchildren and teenagers, nearly all of whom wereunvaccinatedor had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported thedeath of an adultwith measles.

The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.

Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven byoutbreaksin New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.

Health experts point tolower vaccination ratesas a reason for increases inpreventable diseaseslike the measles.

CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This isdown from 95.2%during the 2019-2020 school year — a critical threshold to keep people safe.

""When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),""the CDC states.

Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr., who hasa historyof makingfalse and misleading claimsabout vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as thedeadly outbreakspread in the Southwest.

""We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,""Kennedy toldCBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook inan interviewApril 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.

Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, ""The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,"" but added, ""The government should not be mandating those.""

https://www.yahoo.com/news/happening-south-korea-seoul-caught-090117447.html,2025-07-04 10:15:00,What is happening in South Korea? Seoul has caught the lovebug that nobody wants,"South Korea has recently been hit by another surge of lovebugs.

But romance is certainly not in the air for residents of Seoul and neighboring Incheon city, who have beenplagued by these pesky insectsin recent weeks, as rising temperatures due to climate change spur their spread.

On Friday, dozens of government workers were sent to Gyeyangsan, a mountain west of the capital, to manage an “extremely severe outbreak,” the country’s environment ministry said in a statement.

Videos on social media earlier this week showed scenic hiking trails along the peak transformed into buzzing corridors of chaos.

Footage shows hikers thrashing through swarms of thumbnail-sized bugs, with one person engulfed by the black-winged creatures and another scooping thousands of tiny carcasses from the trail.

Ina YouTube video, a man collected thousands of the insects and took them home to make them into hamburgers, which he then appeared to eat.

Lovebugs, known scientifically as Plecia longiforceps, get their nickname from their mating behavior when they fling into each other while flying.

They are found in the subtropics including southeastern China, Taiwan, and Japan’s Ryukyu Islands. They also occur in parts of Central America and the southern United States, including Texas and Florida.

First detected in South Korea in 2015, they are believed to have arrived there from southern China, according to the environment ministry. Since 2022, they have appeared in and around Seoul, particularly port areas, between June and July, it added.

Experts say climate change and warming temperatures are helping drive lovebugs northward into areas such as Seoul and Incheon.

While global warming is a planet-wide issue, scientists have identified Seoul as an area where temperatures are rising at a faster pace than in other parts of the world.

This is worsened by the city’s heat-island effect, where temperatures are much higher than in nearby rural areas due to man-made structures absorbing and holding more heat.

“With climate change increasing ecological instability, we must remain vigilant throughout the summer,” Kim Tae-o, director of the environment ministry, said.

Lovebugs do not transmit diseases or sting humans. However, there have been increasing public complaints about them sticking to car windows and the walls of houses, restaurants and subway trains.

So far, officials have advised local workers and residents to combat swarms by spraying water or using sticky pads instead of chemical pesticides.

Populations are expanding in the northwest of South Korea, however any further potential spread remains unknown.

“Compared with the past two years, the number of lovebugs sharply surged last weekend at the mountain,” Gyeyang district official Wang Hyeon-jeong said on Tuesday.

Areas with a warm, humid climate could attract them, being favorable conditions for their survival and reproduction.

The city government of Seoul views the lovebugs as “ecologically beneficial,” posing no health risk to humans and helping pollinate flowers as their larvae convert plant materials into organic components.

However,local mediareports that complaints to the city have more than doubled, increasing from 4,418 in 2023 to 9,296 last year, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

On Friday, environment ministers agreed to strengthen and invest more in response procedures after the latest outbreak, which it described as “extremely severe.”

“We will closely monitor the situation and work with local authorities from the early stages of any outbreak,” Kim said.

But natural population control is reportedly setting in, as birds such as sparrows and magpies learn to eat the bugs, causing their numbers to fall.

The president replied, ""Well it means exactly what it says, it's a declaration, it's a declaration of unity and love and respect and it means a lot and it's something very special to our country.""

Far more damaging to the nation than his inability to articulate anything meaningful about our country’s founding document, Trump’s actions in his five months in office violate the most fundamental principles articulated on July 4, 1776 by members of the Second Continental Congress. Here are some examples:

Trump’s approach to governing is certainly more akin to Britain’s George III than to George Washington.

No concept more defines the Declaration than objection to King George’s “Absolute Tyranny” displayed by his refusal to allow colonists a say in the laws that governed them and that made “Judges dependent on his Will alone.”

Trump clearly lusts for King George’s power. He and the modern GOP eschew separation of powers in favor of a “unitary executive,” a doctrine that jettisons the founders’ principle of three equal branches of government with checks and balances in favor of a president with unchecked power.

He respects the judiciary only when it agrees with him and describes judges whose decisions hold him accountable to the law as “crooked,” “corrupt,” “radical left lunatics.” He refuses to criticize his followers who post on his Truth Social account that judges should be assassinated. His administration has even refused to follow judges’ orders not to deport immigrants without due process.

Much like King George, Trump has elevated the “Military independent of and superior to the Civil power,” by unleashing a secret army of unidentified masked agents who kidnap people from our streets, homes and businesses without warrants.

One of the actions committed by King George that the Declaration lists as justifying independence from Britain was “cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world.”

King George imposed stringent regulations severely limiting what colonies could buy from other countries by mandating that necessities like glass and lead only be purchased from England. This meant higher prices for colonists. Then, he imposed taxes on those very same imported English goods, like tea, sparking the Boston Tea Party.

Trump revives this “mercantile” approach by raising tariffs to heights not seen in 100 years, under the illusion that if the U.S. simply exports more than it imports, our economy will improve.

He, like King George, incorrectly views trade as a zero-sum game. This approach is rejected by most economists as wrong because trade is a win-win interaction, with each trading partner focusing on making something they can produce efficiently and then trading that for what they lack.

Though technically different, Trump’s tariffs and George III’s “duties” have the exact same impact on people: higher prices.

Trump promised 90 trade deals in 90 days and has produced only one “outline” of one deal with the deadline less than a week away.

The only thing his tariffs and blustering have accomplished is uncertainty resulting in interruption of trade. Consider the plight of U.S. farmers. The top 10 markets for U.S. soybeans have been hit with tariffs in the Trump-initiated global trade war. According to the American Soybean Association, our farmers could lose around $6 billion annually because Trump’s tariffs force consuming countries to find cheaper sources of soybeans.

And it’s not only farmers. Other industries facing uncertainty caused by the rising costs of imported goods due to Trump’s tariffs include auto, consumer electronics, retail, apparel and semiconductor companies.

Finally, American consumers face increased prices as companies pass on their increased tariff costs. Economists at theAmerican Action Forumestimate that Trump’s trade war will cost a middle-class family $1700 - $2350 per year.

The declaration calls for government and laws for people that “shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” Yet public safety and health is under assault thanks to Trump appointing Robert Kennedy Secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy and DOGE conspired to fire the very contamination experts who were helping Milwaukee Public Schools address itslead problems.

Opinion:Trump's energy dominance plans driving manufacturing renaissance in Milwaukee

Kennedy recently fired 17 members of a scientific committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how to use vaccines. He replaced these experts with people who rose to prominence by denouncing the extremely effective COVID-19 vaccine.

Kennedy has spread conspiracy theories and anti-vaccination disinformation, sowing confusion and distrust on health issues, damaging the safety of communities, fueling a growing measles outbreak and contributing to dramatic drops in vaccination rates for children.

Trump’s administration is attacking universities and savaging federal research grants, thus undermining the ability of these institutions to improve our lives through discoveries and innovation in medicine, technology and defense. Radar, MRI machines, robotics, GPS, cancer and diabetes treatments, are just some of the beneficial discoveries that have evolved out of government-funded research.

Ben Franklin would be aghast at Trump taking a sledgehammer to our nation’s scientific and medical research, greatly endangering Americans’ safety.

One of the founders’ grievances against King George was that he obstructed immigration to the colonies. Colonists opposed these restrictions because the colonial economy suffered from labor shortages. Today, Trump is deporting immigrants who make up almost 20% of the nation’s labor force, often working in the hardest, least desirable occupations.

Opinion:Farmers forgotten as debate over ICE raids, Dodgers and No Kings protests rage

His war on immigrants is creating labor shortages in agriculture, construction, hospitality and tourism. Just as colonists sought increased immigration to grow their economies, immigrants today help drive economic growth. Trump’s war on them is not only cruel but economically destructive.

In declaring the thirteen American colonies independent from the British monarchy, Americans challenged the accepted structures of inequality that had previously governed the affairs of mankind. For centuries humans had lived in hierarchical societies where most people were slaves, indentured servants, soldiers and peasants, destined to serve their superiors: the monarch, landed gentry and priest.

In stating, “…all men are created equal”, the founders laid the basis for an expansive and inclusive democracy even if its principal author was the slave owner Thomas Jefferson. While grappling over the extent of inclusion and the equality of opportunities has defined American democracy for 249 years, the aggregate direction until recently has been toward greater equality.

Trump’s alleged “big beautiful bill” is dredged in inequality. Huge cuts to federal loans, Pell Grants, and work study will mean far fewer working men and women getting the training from colleges like MATC that move them from poverty to the middle class. It will reduce by11 millionthe number of Americans with health care, cut Medicaid and food assistance by $1.1 trillion while showering the richest 1% with annual tax breaks of $63,000 per person.

This blatant economic inequality championed by Trump promotes gross political inequality, sabotaging the promise of the declaration.

Americans celebrating July 4 deserve a president who can both articulate what the Declaration of Independence means and govern according to its principles.

Michael Rosen (Economics) and Charlie Dee (American Studies) are retired faculty from Milwaukee Area Technical College and former leaders of American Federation of Teachers Local 212.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/experts-stunned-animal-colony-remote-104500390.html,2025-07-04 12:15:00,Experts stunned as animal colony on remote island rebounds from catastrophic loss: 'Great news',"A remote colony of elephant seals in southern Chile is showing signs of recovery after being devastated by avian flu just two years ago. Scientists are calling it an ""unexpected and hopeful"" turn that could offer valuable lessons for future wildlife protection efforts.

In 2023, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) swept through the fjords of Chilean Patagonia, wiping out nearly half of the local southern elephant seal population. But according toMongabay, researchers tracking the colony during the 2024–2025 breeding season found that the population had nearly doubled. They counted 33 new seal pups, up from just 16 the previous year.

The colony's rebound may be thanks to its extreme isolation, which limited exposure to outside animals and people.

""It is great news for the conservation of the species, because Jackson [Bay], by being in inland waters of fjords and canals, may act as a protective barrier against pandemics,"" said Cristóbal Arredondo, a veterinarian.

Recovery doesn't just help elephant seals — it can also support ocean ecosystems in general. Elephant seals are considered a sentinel species, meaning their health can offer early clues about the condition of marine environments. And by surviving in a relatively untouched part of the world, this colony may be helping scientists understand how to keep other species safe, too.

The effort to monitor and protect the population is ongoing as researchers are planning drone surveys and DNA tests to detect any lingering traces of the virus, and the team is also calling for stricter rules to keep people and equipment from spreading disease to remote areas.

According to theWildlife Conservation Society, early detection and disease monitoring are becoming increasingly critical in a warming, interconnected world. Meanwhile, the International Union for Conservation of Nature hasemphasizedthe importance of biodiversity protection during outbreaks to preserve global ecosystem balance.

Recent examples include the return of the wolverine to its natural range in Finland after decades of absence, and new efforts in China to track and protect the endangered Yangtze finless porpoise. Both cases show how habitat protection and ongoing conservation work can give even the most at-risk species a chance to come back.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an upcoming project where it will reportedly breed millions of flies, blast them with radiation to make them sterile and unleash them on Texas andMexicoin hopes of reducing the population of theNew World Screwworm and its flesh-eating maggot larvae.

The sterile, irradiated male flies will be released in hopes that they'll mate with wild female screwworm flies. The hope is that the female flies will produce unfertilized eggs that don't hatch, ultimately reducing the number of screwworm larvae.

The end goal is to see the screwworm population die out in the region.

The New World Screwworm Fly is primarily found in forests and wooded areas, but also seeks hosts, including cattle and horses.

Females will typically lay their eggs in the open wounds of live, warm-blooded animals. The maggots, once hatched, burrow into the flesh of the host. Their presence in the wound can potentially kill the host animal.

The flies burrow into the bodies of their hosts in a screw-like fashion, hence their name.

The flies — which are endemic to Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American countries — were thought to have been wiped out in the U.S. as far back as 1966.

The screwworm can infest humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that individuals in the affected areas who ""spend time among livestock animals, sleep outdoors and have an open wound are at greater risk of becoming infested with [New World Screwworms].""

Because of the fly's infestation method, individuals who have recently had surgery are at a higher risk of infestation ""as the flies will lay eggs on open sores,"" the CDC warned.

Unfortunately, the screwworm flies have recently reemerged in Texas, following an outbreak in Mexico. That became public in May, prompting the USDA totemporarily suspend live cattle, horse, and bison importsacross theU.S.-Mexico borderto prevent further spread.

The U.S. used the sterile fly method to nearly eliminate the screwworm flies between 1962 and 1975. In the decade before the fly program began, the USDA estimated that livestock producers in the Southwest U.S. lost approximately $50 million to $100 million annually as a result of the fly.

To facilitate the new version of the fly program, a factory aimed at breeding and producing sterile flies will open in southern Mexico in July of next year. After that, a fly distribution center will be opened in southern Texas to import and distribute the sterile flies throughout the Southwest."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/mosquito-borne-virus-plagues-holiday-165730469.html,2025-07-04 18:30:00,Mosquito-borne virus plagues holiday hotspots in the South of France,"A mosquito-borne virus that causes debilitating joint pain and fever has begun to spread locally in holiday hotspots in the South of France.

Some 712 imported cases of chikungunya were recorded between May 1 and July 1, leading to 14 locally-acquired infections in the same period, according to data from Santé publique France, the French public health agency.

While the disease is routinely brought back to France by returning travellers, the number of imported cases reported this year is greater than the previous ten combined, largely because ofa major outbreak on the French Indian Ocean territory of Réunion.

Chikungunya is primarily spread by the Aedes mosquito (also known as the tiger mosquito) and cannot spread from person to person. But a mosquito can pick up the disease by feeding on an infected individual and then transmit it to new human hosts by biting them.

Most of the locally-acquired cases appear to be clustered around Salon-de-Provence and La Crau, two towns on France’s Mediterranean coast near Marseille, Toulon and Saint-Tropez.

There have also been three locally-acquired cases reported on the island of Corsica and, for the first time, an indigenous case of the virus was reported in the Grand Est region, far to the North East.

The high number of imported cases, coupled with the flurry of locally-acquired infections, has raised concerns among public health officials about the potential for the virus to spread more widely in mainland France.

“The occurrence of a first episode of indigenous transmission in the Grand Est region, combined with the precocity and number of episodes already detected, confirms the significant risk of indigenous transmission of chikungunya in mainland France, including in regions that have been free of the disease until now,” Santé publique France said in a statement.

“This is facilitated by the well-adapted nature of the strain of the virus circulating in Réunion and the Indian Ocean to the Aedes albopictus mosquito vector.”

Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia, said: “What is most worrying is that the 14 reported cases of chikungunya are spread over multiple departments, suggesting that local spread is already widespread in southern France.”

France’s public health agency has launched an investigation into the case in the Grand Est region, and has begun implementing containment measures in the worst-affected areas.

“This kind of thing, we know that it can happen but we never see it coming,” said Florence Brau, the mayor of Prades-le-Lez, a commune on the outskirts of Montpellier where insecticides were being used to suppress the local mosquito population and prevent further spread.

“For reasons of medical confidentiality and to avoid people coming to see how things were going, we were instructed not to say which areas were being treated for mosquitoes. The residents concerned received a letter in their mailboxes,” she told Midi Libre, a local newspaper.

While chikungunya very rarely causes death, its symptoms are debilitating. They usually begin within a week of being bitten and can include a sudden high fever, fatigue, nausea, reddening of the eyes, sensitivity to light and a rash.

But it owes its name, which comes from a word in the Kimakonde language spoken in southern Tanzania meaning “to become contorted,” to the crippling joint pain it causes.

The virus triggers an immune response that leads to inflammation in the joints, causing pain, swelling and stiffness similar to rheumatoid arthritis that can persist for weeks, months and sometimes years after the initial infection.

Alain, a 73-year-old from Prades-le-Lez, is believed to be the second person to catch chikungunya locally in France this year. The retired civil engineer lived in Africa for 10 years and never caught anything, not even malaria.

“Two-and-a-half weeks ago, I came home from playing pétanque, had a shower, then started itching my knee,” he told Midi Libre.

“I looked and my leg had gone completely red. I told myself that I must’ve been bitten by a spider. And the following morning, I woke up in a state of exhaustion that I’ve never experienced.”

Then the pain in his joints began to set in, and within days became so severe that he was unable to use his hands to open doors.

“I couldn’t manage, for example, to bend my wrist to open doors. I had to use my elbow,” he said.

While there is a vaccine available, there is no specific cure or antiviral treatment for chikungunya. Instead, treatment is focused on managing symptoms with rest, fluids, and painkillers.

Alain’s pain eventually subsided but he is still recovering from the virus.

“I’m very tired and I get out of breath quickly. This morning, I just walked down my street and I had to take a few pauses.”

Residents of villages and towns across southeastern France have been ordered to take precautions to fight the spread of mosquitoes, including covering or emptying containers that could collect water, keeping pets indoors, covering swimming pools and closing windows.

The health ministry is also urging locals to report sightings of tiger mosquitoes in their communities using an online tool, and to report suspected infections.

While a vaccination campaign is underway on Réunion, there are currently no plans to launch a similar scheme in mainland France, The Telegraph understands.

Several countries including France, the UK and the United States paused the use of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine among individuals 65 and older in May following reports of serious adverse events, including two deaths and hospitalisations, among the vaccinated on Réunion.

As well as grappling with chikungunya, the French health authorities have also reported spikes in imported cases of dengue and Zika, two other tropical diseases spread by the tiger mosquito which is more commonly found in Asia, Africa and South America.

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), climate change has helped create favourable conditions for the tiger mosquito to spread since it was first spotted in Europe in the late 1970s, making outbreaks of the diseases they carry more common.

Dengue and chikungunyarisk becoming endemic in Europe. In the worst-case climate scenarios, the spread of the two viruses could increase to five times the current rate by 2060, according to a recent ECDC study, with countries like Italy, France and Spain to be among those hit hardest.

“The last three years have seen a fairly rapid increase year on year oflocally acquired dengue in France, Italy and Spain,” said Prof Hunter. “We can expect to see increasing reports of both chikungunya and dengue fever from the Mediterranean area over the coming years.”

Travellers to France are currently being advised to take the usual precautionsto prevent bites from mosquitoes.

“It is essential to take precautions against mosquito-borne infections such as chikungunya while travelling abroad,” Dr Hilary Kirkbride, the Head of Travel Health at the UK Health Security Agency, told The Telegraph.

“Simple steps, such as using insect repellent, covering exposed skin, and sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, can effectively reduce the risk of mosquito-borne infections.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-cases-surge-record-high-144903936.html,2025-07-05 15:45:00,Measles cases surge to record high since disease was declared eliminated in the US,"Falling childhood vaccine coverage and a large, smoldering outbreak that was kindled in an undervaccinated pocket of West Texas have driven the United States to a troubling new milestone: There have been more measles cases in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.

There have been at least 1,277 confirmed cases of measles reported in the US in 2025, according todatafrom the Johns Hopkins University Center for Outbreak Response Innovation. Just halfway through the year, the case tally has already surpassed the last record from 2019, when there were a total of 1,274 cases.

Experts say this year’s cases are likely to be severely undercounted because many are going unreported. Three people have died from measles this year – two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated – matching the total number of US measles deaths from the previous two and a half decades.

Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time. Reaching this status was “a historic public health achievement,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, possible in large part because of vaccine development. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.

Before this year, there have been an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since the disease was declared eliminated, according to CDC data.

In 2019,large outbreaks in New Yorkthreatened elimination status; those outbreaks were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.

This year, the vast majority of measles cases have been in Texas, with more than 750 confirmed cases associated with one outbreak that started in late January. If cases associated with that outbreak continue to accumulate through January of next year, the US could lose its measles elimination status.

Most of those cases – more than 400 since the start of the year – have been in Gaines County, according tothe state health department, where vaccination rates are well below the recommended level. In the 2024-25 school year, nearly 1 in 4 kindergartners in Gaines County did not have their required MMR vaccine, one of the worst rates in the state.

Dozens of cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak, and cases reported in Kansas may also be connected.

Specialvaccination clinicsthat have been stood up in response to the outbreak have led to additional coverage for thousands of people. Many of the affected counties have also introduced expanded vaccination guidance, allowing infants to get their first shot as early as 6 months old instead of waiting until 1 year. In New Mexico, nearly twice as many MMR vaccines have been administered this year than there were at this point last year, according todatafrom the state health department.

And a recentanalysisof health records by Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, shows that early vaccination rates jumped among infants in Texas. MMR vaccination rates among 6-month-olds in Texas this year are more than eight times higher than they were in 2019, and in March and April, about 1 in 5 children who received their first measles shot in Texas had gotten it early, before their first birthday.

But as the pace of new cases associated with the West Texas outbreak has slowed, cases have continued to accumulate across the country. There have been at least 27 total outbreaks – defined as three or more related cases – and at least 38 states have reported at least one case this year.

Cases rose quickly in Colorado last month when an out-of-state traveler flew while infectious, leading to multiple cases among passengers on the same plane, and others among people who were in the airport at the same time and broader community spread from those cases.

Other cases among Colorado residents were linked to travel to Chihuahua, Mexico, where there is also a large outbreak concentrated among the local Mennonite population. There is another large outbreak happening in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to multiple cases in Michigan. At least one person hasdied from measlesthis year in Canada, and there have been nine deaths in Mexico.

In April, Mexico issued awarningfor people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The CDC has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.

The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 8% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC. At least 155 people with measles – about 1 out of every 8 cases – have been hospitalized this year, CDC data shows, and 28% of cases have been in children younger than 5.

The MMR vaccine is safe and extremely effective – one dose is 93% effective against measles, and two doses are 97% effective – but measles is one of the most highly transmissible diseases in the world.

The US Department of Health and Human Services has set agoalthat at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.

Arecord shareof US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according todatapublished by the CDC in October.

When the measles case count reached its previous record in 2019 – under the first Trump administration – both the HHS secretary and CDC director at the time released statements emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.

However, the CDC still does not have a director, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has along and complicated historywith measles vaccines.

In April, when there had been about 600 measles cases in the US, Kennedy made his strongest endorsement of vaccination yet – but it stood in stark contrast to years of work against measles vaccines. And last month, Kennedydismissed an expert panel of vaccine advisersthat has historically guided the federal government’s vaccine recommendations, a move that concerned public health officials across the country.

“With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses,” Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement at the time.

The pause began Thursday and will continue through July 12.

SASA stated that it will continue emergency intakes such as injured, aggressive or visibly ill animals, according to a press statement released on Thursday.

“This proactive step is being taken to safeguard both shelter animals and community pets while containment and treatment efforts are underway,” read SASA’s release.

Zooepidemicus, a streptococcus equi subspecies most commonly called ‘strep zoo,’ is a fast-moving and highly contagious bacterial infection that affects dogs. It can lead to serious illness in shelters where animals are held in close quarters.

SASA stated it’s working closely with other rescue partners to place healthy dogs in temporary foster homes to reduce the shelter’s population density. They’ve also increased sanitation and targeted treatment, according to them.

In the meantime, SASA asked county residents to post photos and locations of loose or stray dogs on platforms like Ring, Nextdoor and local lost-and-found pet Facebook Groups. It also asked for people to hold onto healthy, non-aggressive pets temporarily while searching for their owners, if able. Most dogs are found within a mile of their home, according to the agency.

SASA recommended the following in order to prevent a pet from becoming lost:

Ensuring collars are secure and ID tags are up to date.

Checking that your pet’s microchip is registered with up-to-date contact details.

Being mindful of open doors and gates where pets could slip out unnoticed.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-swears-moms-regularly-051004192.html,2025-07-06 12:00:00,RFK Jr. Swears Moms Are Regularly Thanking Him for Questioning Vaccines,"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy says he cannot walk down the street without mothers swarming him to thank him for the work he has done in questioning the quality of the food supply and the efficacy of vaccines.

Speaking to Kennedy on her Fox News show on Saturday night, Lara Trump said, “Whether it’s the food supply, whether it’s vaccines, a lot of these spaces have felt like, for so long, we’re not supposed to talk about them, we’re not supposed to address them. You’ve sort of blown the doors off of all of that, and I know hear from parents all the time, you must hear from a lot of parents.”

Kennedy responded, ”If I walk down the street, every block, I have moms coming up and saying ‘thank you.’ There’s been this deliberate information chaos, and we’re gonna change all that.”

He continued, ”We’re going to make it so that people can do studies, do gold standard science, that they can replicate those studies, and we’re going to start doing real science and answer these questions for the moms. We’re going to restore public faith in the public health regulatory agencies.”

Kennedy has been a vocal “vaccine skeptic” since the early 2000s, and has perpetuated multiple conspiracy theories, including AIDS denialism and the many-times-debunked idea that a link exists between vaccines and autism.

His work in spreading this misinformation has been cited as a contributing factor in measles outbreaks in Samoa and Tonga. In 2019,Kennedy visited Samoaand met with government representatives in what health advocates and experts have claimed was part of a disinformation campaign designed to stoke distrust in vaccines just months before a deadly measles outbreak that resulted in the deaths of 83 people.

The U.S. had its own measles outbreak earlier this year, and the CDC nowreportsthat there have been a total of 1,267 cases across 38 states, including 27 outbreaks. Three deaths have been attributed to measles.

Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000 by the World Health Organization, thanks to the success of vaccination efforts. International travel and growing vaccine hesitancy are thought to be behind its resurgence.

RFK Jr. haspreviously arguedthat the best defense against measles is contracting the disease, telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity in March, “It used to be, when I were a kid, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection.“ He continued, ”The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes.”

He also asked the CDC to look intovitaminsas a potential treatment for measles. A statement from Health and Human Services issued in May said, “Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities.”

Late last month, Kennedyinstalledlongtime ally Lyn Redwood, who served as president of Children’s Health Defense—the anti-vax group Kennedy chaired from 2015 to 2023—in a top role at the CDC’s vaccine safety office, sparking concerns. Redwood, a nurse, became a vaccine skeptic after her son was diagnosed with autism.

The 1998 paper that claimed to have found a link between the MMR vaccine and autism has since beendebunkedand its author, Andrew Wakefield, struck off the medical register. Despite this, Kennedy—who during his confirmation hearing refused to state that vaccines do not cause autism—hasinstructed the CDCto conduct its own research into the relationship between vaccines and autism.

In a statement issued in March, Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed the research would be conducted, adding, “As President Trump said in his Joint Address to Congress, the rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening.”

Medical professionals acknowledge that autism diagnoses are rising. But, asScientific Americanreported, scientists believe that “rising rates are mostly attributable to broadened diagnostic categories and more comprehensive screening.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/13-juice-recalls-impacted-millions-194000806.html,2025-07-06 20:30:00,13 Juice Recalls That Impacted Millions,"If you've been keeping an eye on the news and thinking thatfood recalls are on the rise, you're not imagining things. Major recalls seem to be hitting headlines on a near-daily basis and some are even deadly, as was the case with thedeadliest food recallof 2025 thus far, wherein supplement shakes killed 14 and hospitalized 41 unlucky individuals.

Some foods are recalled more often than others, with the foods most likely to be recalled including raw meats, deli meats, and produce -- but what about juice? If you think that the only potentially dangerous thing lurking in that carton or bottle of juice in your fridge is the high fructose corn syrup or Red Dye 40, think again. You might just want to check your glass twice before you take that next sip.

Juice is recalled on the regular, and for some truly frightening reasons, from the discovery of bits of metal and plastic floating around in household name-brand fruit juices to cleaning products being found in pouches of Capri Sun. Here are some of the most extensive juice recalls, impacting millions over the last three decades.

In the spring of 2025, Martinelli's, a historic juice and cider brand based in California, issued a recall for its apple juice. The recall impacted more than 170,000 bottles of apple juice that had been distributed across more than half of the United States. The reason? Elevated levels of patulin.

If you're not familiar with patulin, it's a naturally occurring mycotoxin (which is just a fancy word for a fungus-produced toxin). Mycotoxins are found in all sorts of foods, from various fruits like apples to nuts and spices. While recognizing that patulin is a risk and that it can't be killed via pasteurization, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does allow for a small portion of patulin in apple juice products.

While the levels of patulin in Martinelli's were found to be ""elevated"" (perNBC News), it wasn't reported whether or not those levels exceeded the legal limit. Even if that wasn't the case, though, patulin is more likely to occur in elevated levels when apple juice is made from spoiled fruit -- and do you really want to drink juice made from a moldy apple?

It's not just patulin that might appear in your apple juice. In 2024, Refresco Beverages recalled more than 100,000 cases of apple juice that had been sold at Walmart under the Great Value brand, as well as at other major chains under their own brands, including Weis, Walgreens, and Aldi.

The juice was recalled as it contained arsenic above the legal levels. (Yes, just as is the case with patulin, the FDA does allow for a certain amount of arsenic in your food.) Arsenic can enter the food supply in both organic and inorganic forms, from the soil or via environmental pollution. If you eat just a little arsenic, you might experience gastrointestinal distress, heart rhythm abnormalities, or pins and needles in your hands and feet. However, long-term exposure can cause cancer and eating enough will, of course, kill you. The government considers a ""high level"" of arsenic to be 60 parts-per-million.

For many millennials,Capri Sun is the flavor of summer. Unfortunately, in 2022, that flavor was more than a little off. That year, parent company Kraft Heinz issued a recall for 5,760 cases of its wild cherry-flavored Capri Suns. The company said that a diluted cleaning product that was typically used on its processing equipment, had potentially made its way into the actual juice drink blend. The scariest bit? The recall wasn't actually issued until customers began complaining that the Capri Suns tasted weird. At that point, the potential accident was uncovered. Luckily, there were no reports of anyone coming to any harm after drinking the contaminated juices.

We all want our foods processed and manufactured in clean spaces, but cleaning products really need to be kept far away from the actual food. This is hardly the first time in recent history that a cleaning product-related recall has been issued. In March 2025, for example, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled more than 200,000 pounds of liquid egg products (Egg Beaters), after discovering they might contain a cleaning solution made with sodium hypochlorite, aka bleach.

In 2019, World Waters, which makes WTRMLN WTR, recalled its cold-pressed watermelon juices that were, at the time, being sold at major chains across the country, including at Walmart, Winn-Dixie, and Publix. The company said that some consumers could possibly find small bits of soft plastic floating around in their juice, which could prove a choking hazard (and plus, it's just not something you want to eat).

Plastic contamination is one of themost common reasons food is recalled, as is metal contamination. Used both in packaging and in the manufacturing and production processes, the two substances often break apart and wind up in everything from frozen pizzas to cans of soda. While it's estimated that the average human eats about 5 grams of plastic per week, via consuming microplastics, which is about the amount of plastic in a credit card, you certainly don't want to eat more of it -- so if you find a piece of plastic in your food, do yourself (and other unassuming consumers) a favor and report it to the brand.

It's not just food recalls in general that are up. Hospitalizations related to food recalls have also increased. AU.S. PIRG Education Fundanalysis found that, in 2024, the number of food recall-related illnesses increased, year over year, while the number of hospitalizations and deaths actually doubled. Luckily, no one died during a High Hill Ranch apple juice recall in 2015, but one individual was hospitalized.

The ranch had sold some raw apple juice that sickened more than a dozen people, with the juice testing positive for E. coli. The ranch issued a statement at the time that suggested that perhaps the presence of E. coli was due to ranch visitors with dirty hands touching their free sampling station, rather than anything the ranch had done incorrectly in its food production and handling processes. The ranch did, though, stop selling its unpasteurized apple juice. E. coli, a bacteria that lives in animals' lower intestines, can only be killed by cooking foods to 158 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter.

You might enjoy a glass of milk with breakfast, as well as a glass of orange juice, but no one's mixing these two breakfast beverages together, in one cup. However, that was basically the reason for a 2014 recall, when regional chain Lehigh Valley Dairy reported that some of its orange juice may have contained milk, too. The orange juice had been distributed across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, as well as under the Price Chopper grocery store brand. The milk ended up in the OJ due to a manufacturing error.

While this may not seem like a big deal to some -- just throw it out if you pop open your OJ to find a milky surprise -- for others, milk contamination is a serious worry. Milk allergies, which are more common in children, can cause symptoms ranging from the uncomfortable (hives, itching, coughing, vomiting) to the deadly (anaphylaxis). As such, the FDA treats items with undeclared milk in them (whether that inclusion is purposeful or a mistake, as was the case here) very seriously.

It's a general good rule of thumb that, if your food's packaging is swelling, throw it out. Bulging and swelling are some of the main hints that a can of food, for example, may contain the toxin that could cause botulism, a toxin that's life-threatening to the point that it's considered a potential terror weapon. As such, it was probably a good idea, in 2014, when Evolution Fresh recalled nearly 2,000 bottles of its organic sweet greens and ginger juice, because the bottles were mysteriously swelling. The juice had been sold in California and Nevada, in various grocery stores.

At the time, Starbucks owned Evolution Fresh and this was far from the only recall to plague the chain over the years.Starbucks recalls have affected millionsover the chain's lifetime and, in 2014, the chain was also dealing with a Bodum coffee press recall, due to the presses breaking while in use, causing multiple injuries. Starbucks sold Evolution Fresh to juice brand Bolthouse Farms (which has had its own recall worries) in 2022.

Regional grocery chain Wegmans recalled two of its organic fruit juices -- its Food You Feel Good About Organic Apple Juice and Food You Feel Good About Organic Cranberry Juice Blend -- due to an issue not uncommon in the apple juice industry. Like Martinelli's would later discover in 2025, Wegmans found mold byproduct patulin in its juice.

If you see an apple that's turned brown and rotted, or that shows off some blue mold, there's a chance it contains a dangerous level of patulin. However, these visible markers aren't always present, which is how the sneaky, patulin-bearing bad apple can make its way into a juice press. From there, while the fruit juice production process can overall lower the amount of patulin in the final product, it might not lower that amount to the degree that the juice will be considered safe by federal standards. If you do eat patulin, studies suggest that you might experience gastrointestinal stress at best; at worst, the substance is a carcinogen.

In 2012, PepsiCo recalled nearly 300 multipacks of Tropicana Kids orange juice, as it was reported that the drinks contained contaminated water. What exactly the water was contaminated by is up for debate, though, as initial reports simply mentioned a microbiological contamination, which is a broad term that could be linked to anything from viruses and bacteria to fungi and protozoa. The packaging only include the contaminated water, no orange juice at all.

Tropicana has faced numerous recalls over the years. In 2002, Tropicana recalled 100,000 jugs oforange juicethat had been offered at Sam's Club stores across the country, after it was discovered the orange juice had been contaminated with a cleaning solution. In this instance, a consumer was harmed, needing medical care to treat a burning sensation in their mouth and stomach following drinking the liquid. Other consumers sniffed the OJ before sipping, and returned the drink to stores with complaints.

It's allbad news for Tropicana, which has seen financial woesin recent history. This includes decreases in income and revenue that can be tracked to lessened market demand and declining orange harvests, necessitating a $30 million emergency loan.

In 2006, three individuals went to a hospital complaining of vision problems and muscle weakness. Just a few days later, all three patients were on ventilators and, following an investigation into what they had all eaten, it was found that they had all shared a bottle of Bolthouse Farms carrot juice. Later in the month, another patient who'd consumed the carrot juice was also hospitalized, paralyzed, and put on a ventilator.

Bolthouse Farms, of course, issued a recall for the product, which had been distributed across the country and in Canada. At the time of the recall, it was suggested that perhaps the four people who had fallen seriously ill had not properly refrigerated the carrot juice. Improper refrigeration can indeed cause the toxins that result in botulism to build up and, in fact,one studyfound that 37 cases of botulism, including four botulism-linked deaths, occurred in the United States between 1994 and 2021, all trackable to inadequate refrigeration, whether in the consumers' homes or in the stores before purchase. Still, to be on the safe side, a recall was issued.

It's not just your liquid juice you have to worry about. In 2000, Minute Maid recalled its frozen juice bars, a decision that impacted 300,000 boxes of the product, due to the bars containing food-grade plastic. The non-toxic plastic particles were large enough that they were deemed a choking hazard. As for the ""food grade"" bit, no, that doesn't mean that the plastic is necessarily any safer to eat. Instead, food-grade plastics are BPA-free and tested to ensure they won't leach out toxic chemicals when they're in contact with your food -- think a plastic cup or bowl.

Just as recalls have made Tropicana's life a little harder, even though this particular recall occurred more than 25 years ago, it was still a blow for Minute Maid. At the time, the company was struggling to increase its earnings -- though optimistic that the recall wouldn't cause any long-term problems. A decade later, that hope seemed to have panned out, with the Coca-Cola-owned Minute Maid boasting a higher value than Pepsi-owned Tropicana.

The brand's still not free of all recalls, though. In 2024, it had to recall more than 13,000 cases of Minute Made Zero Sugar Lemonade due to a mislabeling error (the product inside each can was lemonade, but not zero-sugar lemonade). In 2021, the brand recalled fruit punch products due to the worry that some of the packaging could contain some missing metal bolts and washers.

In June 1999, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed that it had identified or was investigating nearly 300 cases of salmonella-linked food poisoning that had occurred over the United States and Canada. Throughout the salmonella outbreak, a significant number of the patients treated reported drinking Sun Orchard unpasteurized orange juice. As a result, the brand recalled its juices. Eventually, the CDC tracked the origin source of the salmonella to a Mexican juice producer that had supplied Sun Orchard with some of its product, prompting the federal government to begin testing juice at the Mexican border.

However, this would only be the first juice recall for the brand in 1999. Later, in November, Sun Orchard recalled another nearly 4,000 gallons of salmonella-contaminated orange juice, which had this time been distributed throughout Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington, to primarily food service establishments (meaning any impacted consumers would have likely drank the orange juice at a restaurant).

Very rarely do food recalls make headlines to such a degree that they get their own Wikipedia pages, but this recall can boast one, tragically. In 1996, an E. coli outbreak impacted consumers across Canada and the Western United States, after they drank Odwalla's unpasteurized apple juice and products containing that apple juice. By the end of the outbreak, nearly 70 individuals had fallen ill and a 16-month-old child had died. Others developed life-threatening conditions.

As a result, the company not only recalled all of its apple juice products, but it ended up pleading guilty to criminal charges, making waves as the first criminal conviction of its type and the largest criminal fine in a case of this type to date, with Odwalla on the hook for $1.5 million. The company also paid the victims' medical bills and newly began flash-pasteurizing all its apple juice, after admitting that it did not know E. coli could be found in unpasteurized juice. Not only, though, does unpasteurized juice harbor E. coli, but it also can contain hepatitis A, salmonella, and cryptosporidium.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/biggest-chicken-salad-recalls-us-163300477.html,2025-07-07 17:30:00,The Biggest Chicken Salad Recalls US History,"Technically, a chicken salad isn't the same thing as a salad with chicken in it. Whereas the latter category includes anything from a chicken Caesar to, say, a Southern fried chicken salad, the former is very specifically a mix of chicken and mayo, with various fruits, veggies, and, sometimes, nuts. Abasic chicken salad recipecan include ingredients such as celery, green onion, walnuts, or even grapes. Just about as often as it's served on its own, a chicken salad will make up the bulk of a chicken salad sandwich.

That definition is worth clarifying because chicken salads have been recalled frequently enough for this list to omit incidents merely involving salads with chicken in them. With that said, determining the biggest of the bunch meant combing through the history of chicken salad recalls on the likes of the Food Industry Counsel website. Any case in which 5,000 pounds or more of products that at least largely included chicken salad were recalled ended up making the list. Based on these criteria, each of the following is one of the biggest chicken salad recalls in U.S. history.

Over52,000 pounds of predominantly chicken salad were recalled for a dangerous reasonin August 2021. In total, six chicken salad and two chicken dip products -- all produced by Willow Tree Poultry Farm over the course of four days that same month -- were subject to the expansive recall. They were sold in nine different states, all on the East Coast.

The recall was initiated after a customer filed a complaint through official channels after finding hard white plastic in a Willow Tree product. The company then determined that 52,022 pounds of products produced in the same batch as the one responsible for the complaint likewise carried a risk of containing plastic. No illnesses or other adverse reactions to a Willow Tree chicken salad or chicken dip were reported around that time, so it's safe to assume no one actually consumed any plastic erroneously packaged in one of the recalled items.

In what was one ofthe biggest recalls in Tyson Foods' history, nearly 9 million pounds of prepared chicken products were recalled over the potential to carry listeria bacteria in July 2021. That large number was implicitly a reaction to the fact that active illnesses and even one fatality were linked to listeria-infected Tyson Foods products around that time.

As a natural consequence of this overarching incident, LSG Sky Chefs -- a company that predominantly supplies airline food -- recalled 15,607 pounds of chicken salad sandwiches it prepared for Circle K stores in Phoenix, Arizona, and Southern California. Of course, LSG Sky Chefs produced those chicken salad sandwiches with Tyson Foods chicken, hence the recall. Customers in possession of a Circle K chicken salad sandwich made between June and early July 2021 were encouraged to either dispose of the product or return it for a refund at a Circle K.

Undeclared allergens are a frequent culprit behind major food recalls. Many ofthe biggest BBQ sauce recalls in U.S. history, for example, were for this reason. Since allergic reactions can occasionally become deadly, mere mislabeling is reason enough to pull products from store shelves to prevent a customer with an allergy to an undeclared ingredient from mistakenly consuming it.

In September 2020, two undeclared allergens — walnuts and cranberries — triggered a recall of roughly 6,890 pounds of chicken salad produced by Willow Tree Poultry Farm. That said, this wasn't a simple case of mislabeling, but a more serious packaging issue. After a customer complained about the undeclared ingredients, it turned out Willow Tree Poultry Farm had packaged some containers intended for Willow Tree Classic Chicken Salad with Willow Tree White Meat Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad. Fortunately, no illnesses were ultimately linked to the walnuts or cranberries erroneously unlisted in Willow Tree Poultry Farm's chicken salad at that time.

In 2019,a massive chicken recall affected 83 major retailers. In this case, supplier Tip Top Poultry discovered the presence of listeria bacteria in some of its products without consumers reporting any active infections. One product utilizing the brand's poultry that subsequently required a significant recall was Tuscan Sun chicken salad sandwiches, produced by a company called Jumbo Foods, Inc. Overall, a total of 69,417 pounds of its chicken salad sandwiches were recalled in October.

While Tuscan Sun's was by far the largest chicken salad recall at that time, a couple of other brands supplied by Tip Top Poultry also had to announce chicken salad recalls. Altogether, Grand Strand Sandwich Company recalled over 3,600 pounds of chicken salad sandwiches, while Lipari Foods, LLC recalled six kinds of sandwiches packaged under four brands, adding up to 2,741 pounds.

Listeria contamination has caused several ofthe biggest chicken recalls in U.S. history, so it's no surprise the bacteria has been a frequent culprit behind chicken salad recalls. In one notable instance, listeria concerns necessitated a recall of 6,912 pounds of chicken salad products produced by a Texas-based company called Ron's Home Style Foods in November 2018.

Six different kinds of chicken salad were included in the recall, four of which were packaged under the Ron's Home Style Foods label, whereas two were branded with a Texas Kitchen Salads label. The former were bulk items, weighing either 5 or 32 pounds each, while the latter came in more standard 12-ounce containers. Although the products' distribution was limited to Texas, and they were never linked to any active illnesses, the FDA ranked it a Class I recall, indicating the highest of three levels of potential danger.

One of the most serious chicken salad recalls ever issued came about in February 2018. At that point, health services in Iowa had identified 37 salmonella infections that were traced back to chicken salad produced by a company called Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. The recalled chicken salad was packaged in bulk 5-pound bags under the Fareway Wholesale brand.

A total of 20,630 pounds of chicken salad were ultimately recalled, but salmonella infections linked to the product still spread significantly. As of September 2018, 265 distinct illnesses were confirmed in eight states, requiring 94 hospitalizations. The outbreak even resulted in one death. Triple T Specialty Meats claimed that USDA and FDA inspections found no salmonella at its production facility. All of its chicken salad produced by Triple T Specialty Meats also tested negative -- as long as it was still in the original packaging. This fact seemingly shifted the blame onto the third parties it supplied with its bulk chicken salad.

After multiple customers — of an unspecified quantity, but implicitly more than one — filed complaints through official channels, Trader Joe's ordered a recall of 65,621 pounds of one turkey salad and two of its chicken salads in November 2017. The customers who filed complaints with the grocery store chain found foreign material in their Trader Joe's products, including both hard silica and glass fragments.

The recalled items included white meat chicken salad, curry chicken salad, and turkey cranberry apple salad containers produced during a 12-day span in the same month as the recall. They could be identified by their use-by dates, ranging from November 10 to 21, 2017. While the recalled chicken and turkey salads were produced in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, they were distributed to 12 states in total, predominantly in the Western U.S.

Two distinct chicken salad recalls were announced on June 8 and June 10, 2017. Each would qualify as one of the biggest chicken salad recalls in U.S. history on its own. But given that the reasons behind the recalls were pretty unique and identical, it's safe to assume they resulted from the same underlying issue.

First, Aldon Food Corporation recalled 18,570 pounds of chicken salad packaged under four different brands after a supplier notified the company that the breading potentially used milk that was undeclared on its labeling. Then, the exact same thing happened to Packer Avenue Foods, Inc., resulting in a recall of 9,690 pounds of chicken salad packaged under two brand names. These two cases were never officially linked to one another, but it's hard to imagine that both Pennsylvania-based companies falling afoul of the same issue within days of one another was a coincidence.

The single largest chicken salad recall in terms of sheer quantity occurred in October 2013. The company responsible for producing the widely-recalled product was Boston Salads & Provisions Company, Inc. It was the New Hampshire Department of Public Health that discovered listeria bacteria in two distinct Boston Salads & Provisions products, necessitating a massive recall.

Funnily enough, the recall's geographical reach was limited, given that the four chicken salads and one Caesar salad implicated were distributed in just Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Nevertheless, a grand total of 222,959 pounds of chicken salad and chicken Caesar salad ended up being recalled. Those products were produced between August 23 and October 14 of that year, so the considerable poundage was likely a result of that relatively lengthy production window. No reported illnesses were ever linked to listeria from the affected Boston Salads & Provisions products.

The 2013 Boston Salads & Provisions listeria recall was announced on October 24. That same week, a company called Reser's Fine Foods recalled more than 22,800 pounds of prepackaged products — primarily consisting of chicken salads — also over listeria concerns. Surprisingly, the two incidents appear to be unrelated, and their proximity in both time and root cause is seemingly just a coincidence.

That 22,800 number was the scope of an initial recall, which encompassed products sold under brand names such as Cobble Street, Cross Valley, Chef Solutions, and Stonemill Kitchens, among others. Two subsequent expansions increased the volume of products recalled, albeit with no stated quantity. The expanded list of items did, however, include items sold at stores, including Walmart and Kroger. Products with nearly 20 different brand names were ultimately included in the recall upon its second expansion in early November 2013.

October 2013 may well have been the riskiest time to buy chicken salad at a grocery store in U.S. history. On October 12 and October 17 of that year, Costco recalled four chicken products, including a chicken salad, after they were determined to potentially carry salmonella. Overall, 101,764 pounds of product were recalled. A significant chunk of that number consisted of whole rotisserie chickens, but considering the fact that the recall had such significant poundage, the total quantity of chicken salad was far from negligible.

Despite its sizable scale, the recall was limited to a single Costco store in San Francisco. Despite its relatively limited footprint, the recall's scope was likely so large because actual reported illnesses were linked to the initially recalled products. That said, the October 17 recall expansion was just a precautionary measure, with none of the additional products exhibiting a link to active cases of salmonellosis at that time.

The most urgent food recalls -- which are often cases involving listeria or salmonella -- are labeled Class I by the FDA, indicating the highest possible level of danger. A recall of four chicken salad products and one ham salad product in June 2011 received a Class III classification from the FDA, indicating the lowest possible level of danger. Nevertheless, the quantity of product recalled added up to a hefty 22,594 pounds.

Erroneous labeling was the culprit for this voluntary recall, but since the undeclared ingredients were not common allergens, their undeclared presence did not pose a significant risk. Specifically, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service determined during a routine label inspection that the offending products did not properly indicate the inclusion of potassium sorbate or sodium benzoate. Allison's Gourmet Kitchens was the company responsible for producing chicken and ham salads under the brand names Hill Country Fare and Baker's Kitchen in addition to its own name.

Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate may not be common allergens, but soy certainly is. Undeclared soy necessitated a sizable recall in August 2006, affecting 7,497 pounds of chicken salad. The FDA ultimately decided that this counted as a Class II recall, indicating serious health complications were possible but not likely. While allergic reactions to soy can be plenty dangerous, unknowing consumers were presumably unlikely to encounter the product — be it because of limited distribution or its lower quantity than in some other Class I allergen recalls.

In this case, it was Sandridge Food Corp. that failed to properly label the soy content of Grandma's Original Recipes brand chicken salad. Details about food recalls before 2010 or so are often scarce, so there's not much readily available information about this recall's precise cause or outcome. But given that lack of info, it's safe to assume nobody fell seriously ill as a result of unknowingly consuming soy in a Grandma's Original Recipes chicken salad product.

The earliest case of a major listeria-induced chicken salad recall took place in June 2005. Routine testing by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service returned positive results for listeria, requiring the New York-based Sally Sherman Foods to recall 5,056 pounds of chicken salad and chicken pasta salad. The recalled products were distributed to both stores and restaurants in eight states.

Again, because of limited documentation contemporaneous with the recall, it's not possible to say with certainty that nobody was affected by the potentially contaminated product. But when it comes to recalls, no news likely means no infections. For what it's worth, this was a case of history being doomed to repeat itself — in February 2016, Sally Sherman Foods once again recalled over 3,000 pounds of five different chicken salad products over listeria concerns.

When you start to dig into food recall history, you'll notice that the further back you go, the smaller the scale of food recalls. While food recalls are on the rise, food isn't necessarily becoming more dangerous — rather, food safety measures are improving. It's notable, then, that the earliest major chicken salad recall dates all the way back to July 2000.

Specifically, a company called Mrs. Stratton's Salads recalled 5,400 pounds of chicken salad for the undeclared inclusion of Yellow No. 5. It's technically possible to be allergic to Yellow No. 5, but the probability is pretty slim. Accordingly, the FDA determined that this qualified as a Class II recall for presenting a medium level of danger. Mrs. Stratton's Salads remains in business today and boasts a lineage that dates back to 1953, so the 2000 recall was a mere hiccup in the company's decades of history.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/hopkins-county-health-officials-tracking-214825711.html,2025-07-08 00:00:00,Hopkins County health officials tracking reported Giardia outbreak,"HENDERSON, Ky (WEHT) – The Hopkins County Health Department is currently tracking a parasitic outbreak called Giardia.

Health officials state Giardia is a parasite that is swallowed and goes through the intestinal tract that causes diarrhea. This can be found in water sources like lakes, pools or streams and from unwashed hands touching food and other surfaces after using the bathroom.

Officials state the outbreak is being tracked by epidemiology nurses, the state regional epidemiologist and the state epidemiology department where it is being searched for commonalities. The public will be notified if it becomes available.

So far, the health department is reporting 23 cases of Giardia in the last month.

“This is unusual for Giardia in our county, so the investigation is ongoing,” says the health department.

In the meantime, officials provided some tips to help prevent Giardia including:

Handwashing after using the bathroom, changing diapers, before handling food and after touching animals or soil.

Avoid drinking water from lakes, rivers or streams

Boil water for one minute to kill Giardia

Wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly

Avoid animal feces

Safe food prep

Food service workers to not work when sick

Keep scoops out of ice buckets and wash hands before preparing drinks

Officials are reminding that not everyone needs treatment for Giardia and for individuals to speak to individual providers and to drink plenty of fluids with a diarrhea illness to prevent dehydration. Infants and pregnant women should seek medical care and should avoid others with Giardia, if known.

Amid the Israel-Hamas War that erupted on October 7, 2023, a troubling trend began to take shape: therecruitment of Israeli citizens by Iranian operativesfor espionage purposes.

This development comes at a time of war, endangering state security. Thanks to intelligence provided by the Shin Bet and investigations conducted by the Israel Police, 25 cases of espionage involvingIsraelis working for Iranian intelligenceagencies have been thwarted.

Indictments have been filed, with 40 Israelis expected to face charges. Of these cases, 17 were managed by the National Unit for Serious and International Crime Investigations withinLahav 433, while eight cases were handled by the central units in various police districts.

In every case, investigators succeeded in gathering evidence that led to the arrest of the suspects. Lt. Col. Sarit Peretz, head of the security department in Lahav 433, shared insights on the matter with Maariv.

""Our unit has worked on 17 espionage cases so far,"" says Lt. Col. Peretz. ""These cases reflect a broader phenomenon that began with the outbreak of the war, with Iranian operatives showing a strong drive to recruit from within Israel.""

She continued, ""The first case we uncovered involved a young haredi man from Beit Shemesh in July 2024. At the time, it seemed like an isolated incident. It wasn’t clear that this was part of a larger trend until another significant case came to light. This was the case that brought attention to the phenomenon, with several suspects tied to Iran who had carried out operations for them over the past two years.""

Lt. Col. Peretz further explained, ""From that point, we began to uncover cases involving two or three suspects each, all linked to Iran. Most of these connections began on social media platforms. Initially, it wasn’t obvious that they were Iranian operatives—sometimes they posed as journalists or used friendly or romantic connections. But it quickly became clear that the entity behind these contacts was Iran, with the goal of harming the State of Israel.""

When asked if the suspect's motive was always financial, Peretz confirmed: ""Yes, always. The motive is money—easy money. They are motivated by the desire to receive payments as quickly as possible. There’s also the issue of anonymity—getting money from someone they don’t know.""

Peretz further explained that the money is often funneled through digital cryptocurrencies: ""Exactly. The use of cryptocurrencies allows for greater anonymity and ease of transfer.""

Peretz emphasized the crucial role of theLahav 433 Cyber Unit, which specializes in investigating digital wallets: ""Our cyber unit is the most professional in the Israel Police when it comes to investigating digital wallets. They have the expertise, the global network, and the necessary tools to trace fund transfers and open digital wallets.""

""The tasks assigned to the Israelis progressed in stages,"" said Peretz. ""It starts with identification tasks—confirming the individual is indeed Israeli. They are asked for ID cards and other personal details to verify their identity. Once the operative is satisfied, the tasks become more personal. Israelis are asked to take pictures of themselves or even of supermarket products, or to photograph certain streets. These tasks help build trust between the operator and the Israeli.""

She continued, ""As the relationship deepens, the tasks escalate: graffiti such as 'Children of the Spirit of Allah' or 'Bibi Dictator,' burning IDF uniforms, defacing the Israeli flag. Eventually, the tasks become more dangerous: photographing military bases or strategic locations. In some cases, suspects were asked to handle explosives, purchase weapons, or participate in operations intended to harm people or national security.""

""No one left the country for training,"" Peretz confirmed. ""We arrested suspects before that could happen. However, some were willing to travel to places like Cyprus or Greece, with the idea that they could reach Iran by sea. They even explored how to leave Israel without drawing attention.""

Peretz stressed the importance of collaboration between the Israel Police and Shin Bet: ""When we identify an Israeli element in contact with an Iranian operative, both we and Shin Bet act quickly. Our goal is to assess the extent of the potential damage. Many of those involved caused significant harm before their arrests. Take, for instance, the soldier working with the Iron Dome who transmitted a video from the defense system. Another case involved a suspect renting an apartment in Haifa, with the aim of monitoring the port for information on ships entering and leaving Israel. The goal was to smuggle ammunition into the port.""

Additionally, Peretz explained that not all espionage cases are handled by the Lahav 433. ""Due to the large number of cases, central police units in various districts are also involved in these serious cases,"" she said.

""These units have experience in organized crime investigations, and like us, they collaborate with Shin Bet.""

""The amounts involved ranged from 800,000 shekels to a million shekels,"" Peretz stated.

""Most suspects don’t deny their involvement,"" she noted. ""They acknowledge the cases we’ve exposed but attempt to distance themselves by claiming they didn’t intend to harm Israel. They often argue that they didn’t fully understand the consequences of their actions.""

""While one or two suspects expressed discontent with the state, it was not clearly ideological,"" said Peretz. ""The majority of suspects claimed they loved Israel. But their motivation was always about easy money—they didn’t fully consider the implications of their actions."""

Updated at 2:48 p.m. ET on July 9, 2025

The momentwas quickly overshadowed by other events—first an airline disaster in India, then the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran—but it was nevertheless noteworthy. On June 11, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared before a congressional appropriations committee alongside his boss,Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.Caine, personally selected by President Donald Trump in February and on the job for barely two months, had been keeping a very low profile. Until recently, it was impossible to find on the internet where and when he was born. (Elmira, New York, August 10, 1968.) Staying out of public view was a wise move, given this president’s fractious relationship with America’s military leaders. Trump has said he expects loyalty from “his” generals and casts them aside when they displease him.

Caine’s immediate predecessor,General Charles Q. Brown, wasfiredjust 16 months into his four-year term for the apparent sin of having been appointed by President Biden. Brown, a decorated fighter pilot who is Black, was cast as both a product and an author of “woke” policies at the Pentagon, policies he neither controlled nor would have been free to ignore. Trump’s loathing of General Mark Milley, who preceded Brown, is widely known and ongoing; his official portrait in the Pentagon has been taken down, and earlier this year Hegseth claimed that Milley is under investigation. Brown and Milley are just two of Trump’s discarded and insulted military leaders. On Truth Social, the president has called H. R. McMaster, the former national security adviser, “WEAK AND TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE” and former Chief of Staff John Kelly “a LOWLIFE” and “a bad General”; Trump has also referred to former Defense Secretary James Mattis as “the world’s most overrated general.”

But now Caine was before the cameras. He faced a public session of a Senate subcommittee, and he was asked some questions that put him on the spot. One was from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who asked about the immigration protests in Los Angeles. The administration had sent the National Guard and the Marines to the city to meet what it said was a “foreign invasion”—a claim being used to justify the legality of deploying American troops on American soil. Schatz asked: Did General Caine believe the country was being invaded?

[From the November 2023 issue: How Mark Milley held the line]

Caine replied, “Sir, thanks for your question. At this point in time, I don’t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading.”

A second question came from Republican Senator and Trump confidant Lindsey Graham, who asked about Vladimir Putin’s territorial objectives. At the time, the Trump administration argued that Putin has no larger ambitions in Eastern Europe and that Russia will be satisfied with consolidating its gains in Ukraine. Graham asked: Did General Caine believe that Putin was prepared to stop in Ukraine?

“I don’t believe he is, sir,” Caine replied.

Hegseth, seated next to Caine, and speaking at far greater length, was at pains to present a different view, but it was obvious what the headline was going to be. Within minutes, the CNN crawl read: “Trump’s Top General Just Undercut His ‘Invasion’ Claims.” TheWashington Postheadline read: “Trump’s Top General Contradicts His Assessment of Putin, L.A. Unrest.” In just a few words, Caine had very publicly called into question two of Donald Trump’s favorite assertions.

Trump seemsto have been drawn to Air Force General Dan “Razin” Caine at least in part because he loved his nickname—which happens to be Caine’s F-16 call sign. In February, the president elevated Caine, a retired three-star general, to the nation’s highest military office. It was a typically unorthodox decision: Caine was promoted over the heads of all 38 active-duty four-star generals and admirals. He assumed his duties as the military faced pressure from the president for the use of federal troops as a domestic police force; soon, the president would order U.S. bombers and submarines to attack nuclear facilities in Iran.

Trump has at least twice told the story of how he first encountered the former fighter pilot on a visit to the al-Asad Air Base, in western Iraq, in late December 2018. The president had gone, as he put it, “to meet the generals” and “find out why we’re not defeating ISIS.”

The Pentagon’s top command and his advisers were telling him that the effort would take many more months, possibly even years. So Trump was delighted when, in his telling, a frontline, lower-ranking officer at al-Asad told him that if more American power were unleashed, the job could be done in a week.

“You’re the man I’m looking for,” the president said he told the officer. He related the story in his 2019 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC):

I said, “What’s your name?”

“Sir, my name is Razin.”

“What the hell kind of a name?” I said. “Raisin, like the fruit?”

He goes, “Yes, sir, Razin.”

“What’s your last name?”

“Caine. Razin Caine.”

I said, “You gotta be kidding me.” It’s true!

Still smitten six years later, Trump embellished the story in another CPAC address. He related that someone—widely and wrongly interpreted as Caine—had donned a MAGA hat in that meeting, professed his love for Trump, and vowed to “kill” for him. Trump has no compunction about using the military as a backdrop for partisan purposes, but by long tradition the Pentagon stays out of politics. As Caine diplomatically put it during his Senate confirmation hearing in April, when reminded of Trump’s account, “I think the president was actually talking about somebody else.”

Trump may have misremembered, but he didn’t forget. He had found his man, a seeming hell-raiser after his own heart. In February, weeks into his second term and six years after that meeting at al-Asad, Trump nominated Caine to head the Joint Chiefs. Caine is the first man chosen for the job who was outranked by all the other service chiefs. Multiple senators saluted Brown for his service during the confirmation hearing for Caine, who in turn thanked the general for his “more than 40 years of selfless service to our nation.” Caine was confirmed, but 25 senators, all Democrats, voted against him, less out of objection to Caine than concern about Trump’s handling of the appointment.

As tickled as Trump was about Caine’s call sign, it’s not clear what he thought it conveyed. Fighter pilots are given call signs with multiple meanings, often comical. “Razin” does suggest that Caine is given to bucking rank and shaking things up, precisely the qualities that delight Trump. But call signs are often ironic—like calling a skinny kid “Fats.” Caine is known as a team-oriented officer with a deep respect for the chain of command. He might be the last person in the ranks to raise hell. And the word with the droppedgis, in any case, notraisingbutrazing. It evokes Caine’s skill spearheading air assaults as a fighter pilot.

Heather Penney, a retired Air Force major who flew F-16s with Caine, put it this way when I spoke with her: “Making an offensive counter air push with Razin in the lead—man, everything died in front of us. He was just so good.”

Caine was awarded a fourth star just before he was sworn in as chairman. This was pro forma. Traditionally, chairmen have previously held a “combatant command” or led a branch of the military, the usual criteria for a fourth star. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs commands no troops, but Caine’s background might actually make him better suited for the top job today than many of his peers. Particularly since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq, American military action has primarily employed three sectors: air power, covert special ops, and intelligence. The attacks against Iranian nuclear sites in June certainly involved two of these and likely all of them. Here Caine has more direct experience than most four-stars. He has been providing air cover for covert or “dark” units on and off since helping to hunt Scud missiles in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. And he recently concluded three years of service as associate director for military affairs at the CIA, overseeing that agency’s relations with the Department of Defense.

His climb through the ranks was always unorthodox. He became a White House fellow in 2005–06, working for the Department of Agriculture, followed by a stint at the Homeland Security Council. Through the years that followed, he moved in and out of full-time station, partnering in business ventures while serving part-time with the National Guard and receiving steady promotions by the Air Force (Guard pilots have dual status). He is the first Air Guardsman ever to rise to chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Prior to his selection, he had retired at age 56—he called it a “graduation,” not a retirement—to become a partner in a venture-capital investment firm. By all accounts, Caine had no idea that he would soon be back in uniform, much less in the job he now holds.

The president has made many startling top-level appointments, often of people with minimal credentials and with values at sharp odds with the agencies they lead. Some of the people he has chosen seem keen mostly on the performative aspects of the job. (Hegseth is a former co-host of the weekend edition ofFox & Friends.) Caine does not fit this mold, and his selection was met with relief from the career military. He is known to be apolitical, and is genuinely liked. Where Trump is boisterous and self-aggrandizing, Caine is retiring and reflexively self-deprecating. The chairman is openly religious and prays over important decisions.

The role of chairman of the Joint Chiefs is defined by Chapter 5 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code. The chairman is strictly an “adviser.” He (there has never been a woman in the role) does not make decisions or command troops. When the chairman transmits orders to combatant commanders, he does so in the name of the president and the secretary of defense. He collects information, analyzes it, and develops recommendations for the president, the defense secretary, the National Security Council, and, importantly, Congress—which explains Caine’s contradiction of Trump in his committee testimony.

The statute makes clear that the chairman is independent. No matter how Trump has presented Caine, the general is not a political appointee or a member of the administration. When a president formally addresses Congress, his Cabinet is seated to his left in chairs that have their names engraved on the back. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is not among them. He is seated with the other service chiefs to the president’s right, by the Supreme Court justices. His advice is meant to reflect the judgment of the military alone, heedless of political or partisan considerations. Caine will find that it is hard to give advice to a man who feels he already knows best and prefers not to be contradicted.

Top generals from Douglas MacArthur to George C. Marshall—though neither of them was a Joint Chiefs chairman—have found themselves snared in political disputes, sometimes of their own making. During Trump’s first term, Mark Milley was accused of both siding with the president and undercutting him. Merely disagreeing or correcting Trump is enough for the president to accuse someone of disloyalty. Telling superiors what they do not wish to hear is part of a senior military officer’s job—and one reason why Trump has rid himself of multiple generals he has been close to. Will Caine have to remind Trump that using the military against American citizens is illegal, as is using the military to arrest and deport immigrants? Trump may not want to hear that concern for civilians can impede drone strikes abroad, or that invading Greenland or Panama would violate international law. Caine told reporters it was “way too early” to assess the impact of the U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities; Trump almost certainly did not want to hear this. The conflict with Iran will evolve in ways that cannot be foreseen, and Caine may soon be presenting Trump with complex, delicate questions that disturb his fondness for simplicity.

[Leon E. Panetta: The U.S. military’s loyalty is to the Constitution, not the president]

It would be hard to list all the points of potential friction in store for Caine. Trump is given to flashy displays and fancy and expensive new armaments—a new F-47 fighter jet (the “47” honors, in part, his second presidency), a “Golden Dome” of anti-missile defense for the entire country—this at a time when the military’s industrial base isincapable of meeting basic demand for munitions. Caine’s hasty elevation may also put him in the awkward position of having to deal with service chiefs and combatant commanders whom he now outranks. There is a danger, from both the Pentagon and the White House, that he will find himself sidelined. And if Trump doesn’t like what he hears from his top military adviser, he can always just stop listening—or send Caine to join Brown, Milley, Mattis, and Kelly in private life.

Dan Cainemight not meet some of the historic criteria for success in a Trump administration, but he does look the part—a big consideration for this president. One of Trump’s highest compliments is to describe someone as “right out of central casting,” a phrase he has used to describe Caine: a white, middle-aged male, hair flecked with gray, chest pinned with rows of service ribbons. He is fit and small, seemingly made for the snug cockpit of a fighter jet. He has dark eyes, a broad forehead, a long, prominent nose, and thin lips that curl slightly at the ends, giving him a naturally mirthful expression. He is poised, careful, and deliberate, with an arrestingly direct gaze. His manner is so deferential that, while genuine, it might lull others into underestimating him. He is generally reluctant to talk about himself, but when he gets going he is a skilled and humorous storyteller, usually making himself the butt of the joke. From his youth, he appears to have been without ambition for rank or status—among other things, his occasional detours into civilian life would usually be missteps for an officer bent on promotion.

In relating the major jumps in his career, he insists on his lack of distinction and expresses amazement at his luck.

About his college years: a “very marginal GPA,” Caine said last year on a podcast calledAfterburn, aimed at the fighter-pilot community.

About his first attempt to obtain a White House fellowship: “Didn’t even get an interview because I was such a marginal applicant.”

As a man who has built his career controlling powerful, complex machines, Caine has a curious way of referring to people: not as men or women or even persons, but as “humans.” His former weapons instructor is “a legendary human.” A training exercise had “world-class humans in it.” The colleagues he worked with at a National Guard test center were “world-class tacticians, leaders, thinkers, humans.”

And as warm a human as he appears, Caine can also lapse into dense pilot-speak. Here’s how he described an early special-ops planning session: “We literally on a whiteboard sketched out what the first-ever data-link enabled, time-sensitive targeting structure might be, from the link CONOPS to roughly how we would task in a portion of air power that was set up in an air-tasking order.”

Caine wanted more than anything to be a fighter pilot. He spent his childhood on American air bases around the world, watching and feeling those sleek, powerful machines thunder overhead. Caine’s father, retired Colonel Steve “Cobber” Caine, had been up there, flying the F-4 fighter in the Vietnam War, and later commanding a squadron of F-16s. He wanted one for himself. In 1990, fresh out of the Virginia Military Institute’s ROTC program, Second Lieutenant Caine was accepted for Air Force pilot training, a notoriously selective program. He learned to fly the first-level trainer T-37, a two-seat subsonic jet called “Tweety Bird,” or the “Mighty Tweet,” to distinguish it from the more challenging next-level trainer, the supersonic T-38 nicknamed “Talon.” Many trainees don’t get that far; they are routed to the Air Force’s giant fleet of transports, tankers, and reconnaissance aircraft. Caine had the skills to go all the way.

But many of the top pilots in Caine’s training class, even if they were moved up to the T-38, would never fly fighters. After Desert Storm, the U.S. military was downsizing. The Air Force had more pilots than planes. Caine foresaw that he would likely be “banked,” or held in reserve. He would earn his wings only to be given an administrative post as, say, a communications specialist or finance officer at a distant Air Force base. He would pilot a desk. Eventually, as opportunities arose, he might get an airplane, but it was just as likely that he wouldn’t.

Coming from an Air Force family, Caine had a better grasp of military topography than most. He knew there were available F-16s with National Guard squadrons around the country. Guard squadrons are under the jurisdiction of states; governors deploy them to respond to natural disasters or to provide a show of force during civil unrest. In the days of Caine’s apprenticeship, they mostly patrolled their state’s airspace, where they were more likely to encounter a UFO than combat, and were summoned for noisy flyovers at ceremonial events. Most Guard pilots were weekend warriors, attending college or holding down civilian jobs. They were available to be mobilized for war, but in this brief illusory moment after the collapse of communism, it seemed possible that America would never again fight one.

For a youngAir Force lieutenant on the path to fly fighters, the National Guard was a step down. But these local Guard units had F-16s. Even before finishing his Mighty Tweet training, Caine began pounding out letters and résumés on his typewriter. He sent them to every Guard unit in the country, more than 80 at the time, begging to be taken on, offering to do the most menial scutwork, to be the squadron “snacko,” the one who keeps its off-hours club supplied. He joked about it last year with John “Rain” Waters, a retired F-16 pilot who hostsAfterburn. Caine seemed slightly amazed to recall his youthful desperation and energy, typing away in his off-hours every morning and night. He said he was willing to do anything, even pleading for the snacko post, tongue only partly in cheek: “I’ve trained for this moment. There are 1,964 ounces of beer in a U.S. keg. I will never run out of popcorn.”

He used his leaves to take long road trips, pleading his case in person to every Guard unit that responded. He finally scored with the 174th Attack Wing, in Syracuse, New York, which had a last-minute opening and agreed to bring him on as an F-16 pilot. “I still can’t believe they took a risk on me,” Caine recalled on the podcast. One problem: He committed to Syracuse before he had completed his Air Force training, which, at the time, was like signing with a Triple-A ball club in Scranton while still in camp with the New York Yankees. He would need permission from his wing commander to leave active duty. A move like this was simply not done. The Air Force had invested a great deal of time and money in him, had plucked him from hundreds of wannabe fighter jocks, and it expected him to serve for at least 20 years, whether he was flying or not. Wing commanders jealously guarded the skilled pilots they had in reserve; they had quotas to keep. Now here was Lieutenant Caine, not even fully hatched, asking permission to leave. When he presented his wing commander with the request, Caine remembered, “He lost his mind and threw me out of the office. He would not sign my piece of paper and told me that I was a quitter.”

He kept trying, and eventually his commander caved. Caine is still not sure why. He considers it a lasting stroke of pure luck. The path he took is more common today, at least in part because of his example, but he finished training with what felt like a firm kick in the ass. It only hurt until he settled into the sheepskin seat of his first F-16.

It is a beautiful machine, and a joy to fly—relatively small and enormously powerful, with short swept-back wings and a tall tail fin. In flight it is so sensitive to a pilot’s hand that, as Heather Penney observed, “You think it, and the jet does it.” Despite this ease of control, pilots exit the aircraft after a flight exhausted and drenched with sweat. “Your brain has to be just miles in front of where the aircraft is,” Penney explained, “because of the speed at which you’re going and the closure rates of the tactics.”

Up there at 50,000 feet, inside the frameless bubble canopy, pilots can feel like they own the world. The sky above is dark blue, the bottom of space, and below is a vista so vast that pilots can see the curvature of the Earth. Time stretches as the planet shrinks. Traveling at the jet’s top speed, Mach 2—more than 1,500 mph—a pilot in Washington, D.C., could get on the phone at noon, make a lunch date for noon in Texas, and, with the time difference, arrive early.

By 2001,Caine had completed Weapons School—the Air Force’s equivalent of the Navy’s Top Gun program—at Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada, and was flying with the National Guard’s 121st Fighter Squadron out of Andrews Air Force Base, just outside D.C. He was there on September 11, when hijacked commercial airliners flew into the World Trade Center towers, in Manhattan, and the Pentagon, in northern Virginia. Pilot Heather Penney’s call sign was “Lucky,” which played on her surname but also, she says, evoked the adage “Better lucky than good.” Women F-16 pilots are rare even today. Thirty-four years ago, she faced unveiled hostility from some of her male colleagues. Caine was not one of them. “Razin has a quiet authority about him that is based on his credibility and his knowledge,” Penney told me. “He was not egoistic. You might imagine that someone with his level of training would have been, but he was incredibly humble.”

That sunny morning in September, the attacks came literally out of the blue. In the first hour, there was no knowing what would happen next. And, in fact, a fourth hijacked airliner, United 93, was now bearing south toward Washington. What was to be done about it? The 121st Fighter Squadron was not one of the Guard’s four designated “alert units” in the country. The missiles the F-16s would have carried weren’t even assembled. Their machine guns were loaded with nonexplosive training rounds. Lieutenant Colonel Marc Sasseville, the squadron’s commander, ordered Caine and his wingman, Brandon Rasmussen, to wait for missiles to be assembled and loaded onto their fighters before taking off. Sasseville chose Penney to fly her plane on his own wing, and the two of them ran to their unarmed jets and took off, bent on intercepting any planes that might enter the capital’s restricted airspace. Their options for stopping one were near suicidal. As Sasseville assessed it, they could shoot their training rounds and pray that they hit a fuel tank and caused a spark to ignite it. If they strafed the cockpit they might hit the hijacker pilot, but the airliner could still be controllable and a threat.

“I really needed to make it stop flying,” he told me. “And the only way to do that was to ram it and break a wing off it; then it would disintegrate in the air. The risk of surviving that, in my estimation, was low, because I’m not aware of anybody who’s ever tried. So my idea was to have one hand on the stick guiding the airplane towards the wing root with the other hand on the ejection handle.”

As it happened, before Sasseville and Penney even took off, United 93’s passengers had attacked their hijackers and sent the plane crashing into the Pennsylvania countryside, killing everyone aboard. But no one in the 121st Fighter Squadron knew that. All four pilots had faced the lasting horror of having to contemplate bringing down a commercial airliner in flight, perhaps suicidally. It hadn’t been necessary, but the scenario became the pilots’ legacy, and made them famous in their community.

In early 2003,before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a secret American air base was established in eastern Jordan. During the first Gulf War, a decade earlier, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had fired Soviet-designed Scud missiles at Israel. This time around, the plan was to destroy Saddam’s Scuds before the fighting started and Caine, in addition to flying his F-16 on attack missions, was the project officer. To execute it, he had worked closely with the special-ops teams for almost a year.

Lieutenant Colonel Vinnie Savino’s 38th Air Force Rescue Squadron had been one of the first on the ground at the base in eastern Jordan. His unit had 25 airmen to start. After they helped build out the old Jordanian airfield to suit the needs of a continuing U.S. operation, the 38th settled into a hangar at the far end of the flight line. They had a ringside seat as the warplanes began to arrive, screaming down to land and taxiing to the far end of the runway, where the headquarters were. This was the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing, the fliers Savino’s unit would have to go find if they bailed out inside Iraq.

In general, tech sergeants do not mingle with fighter pilots, so Savino was surprised when Dan Caine showed up at his hangar, just to get to know the unit. Then he brought the other pilots in his wing—“guys and gals,” said Savino, approvingly. Together Caine and Savino planned a “monster mash,” a grueling running and training exercise meant to simulate the conditions of a rescue. Savino recalled the kinds of questions he asked Caine and the other pilots.

If you eject and make it to the ground, do you just get up and run?

They discussed the likely terrain, and then the pilots were sent off to run several miles in their gear through land that might resemble it.

What if your co-pilot or wingman is injured?

They practiced emergency first aid.

What kind of weapon will you have?

Pilots carried 9 mm pistols.

What if you have a broken arm? How are you going to cock your weapon?

They were shown how to cock a pistol with their heel.

One day in 2005,Mike Johanns, then the secretary of agriculture, spotted a new face outside his office.

“What do you do here?” Johanns asked a 37-year-old Dan Caine.

“Anything you want, Mr. Secretary.”

Caine, then a lieutenant colonel, had succeeded in winning a White House fellowship on his second try, and was assigned to the USDA, an agency he knew little about and had never expected to join. “Well, come with me,” said Johanns. They were driven in the secretary’s car to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, built in the French Second Empire style, immediately west of the White House. Caine followed Johanns into an elevator, which quickly filled with famous faces. There was Andy Card, the president’s chief of staff, and Vice President Dick Cheney with his Secret Service agents. “I’m just shrinking into the back of the elevator, hoping that no one will say anything to me,” Caine told Waters in theAfterburninterview, describing his year with the USDA.

The George W. Bush administration was starting to dissect the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, which had devastated New Orleans, killed an estimated 1,800 people, and caused massive flood damage in three southern states. The administration had been widely criticized for its slow response. Now it was going to study what went wrong and how to be better prepared. Caine was given the job of reverse-engineering the USDA’s response to the disaster.

If there is a single trait that defines a good F-16 pilot, it is the ability to monitor and process a dizzying flow of data from a variety of cockpit screens, and to react quickly. Caine was now soliciting data from a department with more than 100,000 employees and eight major divisions. Many functions were in play during a national disaster. He pulled together the information and then briefed his boss. Mike Johanns gave Caine additional responsibility, which generated pushback. Johanns recalled, “I actually had a staff person come to me while Dan was with us and say, ‘You know, Mr. Secretary, you’ve given him so much authority here, and keep in mind that he’s just a White House fellow.’” The staffer pointed out that Caine was very young, very inexperienced, and very temporary. The secretary was unmoved. “He was just so capable,” Johanns told me.

People also tend to trust Caine. “I think the way I would describe it is: If you would’ve talked to the director of the CIA, he would’ve told you that Dan was his guy,” said General Jim Slife, who was fired by Trump as Air Force vice chief of staff this past February, in an interview. “And if you would’ve talked to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the secretary of defense, they would tell you that Dan was their guy. It’s just that Dan was able to understand and empathize with each of the parties and communicate in a way that made them understand that he knew what their equities were and he was fighting for their equities. I don’t mean that in any way as a put-down. I mean, I think that’s graduate-level interpersonal skills.”

Trump had anagenda on that trip to Iraq’s al-Asad Air Base in 2018. A sizable American force was still in the area, seven years after U.S. combat operations had officially ended. Trump had announced a week before his visit thathe was going to withdraw all of the U.S. forces in Syria and half in Afghanistan. This conflicted with the Pentagon’s advice—doing so would be dangerously premature and betray our allies—and Secretary of Defense Mattis resigned. At that point, the fight was focused on the remnants of ISIS in Syria. There was also the ongoing effort by a variety of factions—often at war with each other—to oust the dictator Bashar al-Assad. The American mission was primarily to assist one of these factions, the Syrian Democratic Forces, which was doing most of the fighting against ISIS on the ground. Knotted up in this were relations with Russia, Iran, Israel, Turkey, and other powers. Trump is notoriously intolerant of complexity. He regards expertise as hidebound thinking. He came looking for a simpler solution.

[From the October 2019 issue: Why did James Mattis resign as defense secretary?]

As a precaution during its approach to al-Asad—an active war zone—Air Force One had turned off its lights. This irritated the president. “We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can’t land a plane with the lights on 20 years later?” he asked a CPAC audience in 2019, prompting laughter and applause. “How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars, and we have to fly in with no lights.” That was his frame of mind when he met with the frontline commanders. Caine was now a general, but one of the lower-ranking ones in attendance. In the years since working in Washington, he had been in and out of active duty, involved with several business start-ups. Now he was deputy to General Paul LaCamera, who headed the Special Operations Joint Task Force. Caine was also, because of his experience as a White House fellow, probably more comfortable addressing a president than others in the room. After describing in that 2019 speech how he had learned Caine’s name, Trump went on to elaborate:

So I have Razin Caine, three other generals, colonels, sergeants … And I said to the generals, “Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent [of ISIS], which is what we had left.”

“It won’t, sir.”

And I said, “Tell me why it won’t.”

“It won’t, sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster.”

“Okay, General Razin Caine, how fast can—”

“Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week.”

I said, “One week? I was told two years.” [Laughter.] “One week?”

“That’s right, sir. We’re only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over—from the base that you’re right on, right now, sir. They won’t know what the hell hit them.” [Applause.] “They won’t know what the hell hit them, sir.”

And I said, “Why didn’t my other generals tell me that? Why didn’t they tell me that?” I said, “Did you tell them that?”

“Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders. You’re the first one to ask us our opinion.” [More applause.]

It’s true. It’s true. True. True.

It wasn’t. The set-up was one of Trump’s standard tropes—the commonsense, inspired leader beset by elite nincompoops who plucks a like-minded soul from the lower ranks—and the account was false. Other sources familiar with the meeting, though reluctant to challenge Trump’s account in public, say that Caine did not act or speak the way Trump said he did. He did answer Trump’s questions, but not about the U.S. effort in general. He was presenting a plan of attack for a single ISIS location, which he was confident could be destroyed rapidly. He did not offer an opinion about the overall operation, nor did he imply that the effort was somehow hamstrung by official limitations. Nothing Caine explained to the president differed from what the others in the room understood. And the upshot of the meeting was that the assembled generals, including Caine, persuaded the president that any sudden withdrawal of American troops would be against U.S. interests, a gift to ISIS, and a betrayal of trusted allies. The forces were not withdrawn. Today, seven years later, thousands of American troops are still supporting the effort to destroy what remains of ISIS in Syria.

None of this apparently made a dent in Trump’s memory, or in his impression of Caine. In his 2024 retelling, here were his exact words about that initial encounter with Caine, after he asked for the general’s name.

And he gave me his name.

“What’s your name, sergeant?”

“Yes, sir. I love you, sir. I think you’re great, sir. I’ll kill for you, sir.”

Then he puts on a Make America Great Again hat. You’re not allowed to do that, but they did it. I remember I went into the hangar, and there were a lot of—hundreds of troops. And they’re not supposed to do this, but they all put on the Make America Great Again hat, right? Not supposed to do it. I said, “You’re not supposed to do that. You know that.”

They said, “It’s okay, sir. We don’t care.”

It’s easy to see why reports of these remarks were confused. Trump’s fluid rhetorical style is, perhaps deliberately, tough to pin down. Note the ever-shifting focus: asking for Caine’s name, then a reference to “he,” then to “sergeant,” then to “they,” and then back to “general.” A close reading shows that Trump was not putting the MAGA hat on Caine, but rather on an unnamed sergeant. Still, Trump never clarified the matter, or perhaps never cared to, and after the general’s appointment was announced,Politico’s headline read: “MAGA Hat Drama Could Taint Trump’s Top Military Advisor Pick.”The Daily Beast’s headline read: “Trump Makes MAGA Hat-Wearing ‘Killer’ Chairman of Joint Chiefs.”

When asked about the inaccuracy of Trump’s recollections, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: “General Caine successfully helped President Trump obliterate ISIS in just a few weeks in his first term after Obama had called it a ‘generational threat’ we just have to live with, and then he oversaw one of the most secretive and perfectly successful operations in U.S. history—obliterating Iran’s nuclear facilities.” Caine declined to comment for this story.

All of this landedDan Caine in a touchy spot. He was both beneficiary and victim of Trump’s story—a story that, to officers of his grade, made him look like a toady, if not a buffoon. But how do you deny and publicly embarrass the president who has just raised you from obscurity to the nation’s highest military office?

This is what Trump does: He creates brands. He has had great success doing it for himself, but the brand Trump created for Caine was a bad fit. The general did what he could to discard it during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, in April.

“Let me just start out by asking you about some hyperbole that may have been out there in the press,” said the committee chairman, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. “General Caine, did you wear a MAGA hat in front of the president?”

Caine said simply, “No, sir.”

“Did you wear a MAGA hat at any time?”

“No, sir.”

“Okay, would you like to elaborate on that answer?”

“Sir, for 34 years I’ve upheld my oath of office and my commitment to my commission, and I have never worn any political merchandise.”

Concerned about Trump’s tendency to stretch his authority beyond legal limits, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona asked, “To whom or what do you swear an oath?”

“Senator, as I have for 34 years, it’s to the Constitution,” Caine said.

He was asked repeatedly if he was willing to tell the president things he didn’t want to hear.

“Senator, I think that’s the most important part of this job,” he told Mike Rounds of South Dakota.

“It ultimately is the whole job,” he told Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.

Since Caine became chairman, there have been air strikes in Yemen and Somalia. American troops remain engaged on the ground in Syria, have continued to supply Ukraine, and are present in large numbers in East Asia and the Middle East. In June, Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities and other targets, leading to an outright state of war—one that the U.S. joined with Operation Midnight Hammer, in which American B-2 bombers dropped the most powerful conventional bombs in the U.S. arsenal on three nuclear sites in Iran. At home, the White House has pushed to use military force against domestic protests—efforts that so far have resulted in a highly publicized presence but no real action. The president and his chairman have lots to talk about.

By all accounts, Caine is giving straight professional advice. He seems to prefer doing so in private, although when called on to comment publicly he hasn’t ducked. If things don’t go as he might wish, he is unlikely to resign, protest, or publicly criticize the president—it is not his way. If Trump tires of listening to him, if he is fired in the usual hail of abuse, regard for him at the Pentagon—the world that for Caine matters most—will not suffer. He has spent most of his military career working in the shadows, with units who brand themselves “quiet professionals.” Unlike many of his predecessors, he hasn’t held a routine press conference and has mostly refused requests for interviews. His inclination is to make himself as invisible as possible. He would like to avoid becoming the story himself, as some of his immediate predecessors have done.

Then Caine was drafted into a June 26 press conference that Trump touted as a “fight for the Dignity of our Great American Pilots.” Caine appeared at the Pentagon with a testy Hegseth, who scolded journalists for covering an initial intelligence assessment of the operation—that the strikes set back Iran’s nuclear program only by a matter of months—and for not being sufficiently grateful to men and women in uniform. Caine followed Hegseth’s rant with a technical review of the bombings, blue marker and laser pointer in hand, and a heartfelt tribute to the “awesome humans” who prepared for 15 years for an operation like Midnight Hammer. At one point, Caine put his listeners in the boots of Patriot missile crews who were charged with neutralizing Iran’s retaliation on U.S. forces in Qatar.

“It’s hot, you’re getting nervous, and you expect an attack,” Caine said, seeming to relish the opportunity to transmit the experiences of soldiers. Then your crew “turns a key and relinquishes control of those missiles to that young lieutenant inside the vehicle. And you wait. You know that you’re going to have approximately two minutes—120 seconds—to either succeed, or fail.”

Especially in contrast with Hegseth, Caine was “almost lyrical,” according toThe New York Times. The tone of the press conference was good-cop, bad-cop—so much so that the Reuters journalist Idrees Ali asked Caine if he had been “pressured” by Trump or Hegseth to give “a more rosy intelligence assessment.”

“I’ve never been pressured by the president or the secretary to do anything other than tell them exactly what I’m thinking,” Caine replied, “and that’s exactly what I’ve done.”

Unlike his congressional testimony earlier in June, in which Caine contradicted the president, at the press conference he was on message, taking Hegseth’s cue to focus on the soldiers, not on whether Midnight Hammer had been a true success.

The oath sworn by all U.S. military officers states that “I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.” In other words, Caine is obligated to obey lawful orders. He does not make political decisions. He may refuse an unlawful order and argue that point in his defense if he is court-martialed, but he is duty bound to carry out all others, whether he agrees with them or not, even if they directly contradict his advice, even if he believes they are harmful to the country, even if he believes they are immoral. As Joint Chiefs chairman, Caine is required to convey the president’s orders, but there is nothing to stop him from noting his disagreement—in-house, if not publicly. This would be a quick way of provoking Trump’s ire, but Caine told the senators he was prepared to be dismissed from the job if the president didn’t like his advice. He did not seek the position. Trump came looking for him.

Senator Kelly again: “If necessary, will you choose the right thing to do? Even if it is hard over the easier wrong option?”

“Senator, I’ve always strived to do the right thing, and that’s not going to change now.”

Less likely but also possible would be resistance from inside the Pentagon. Caine can relay the orders of the president and the secretary of defense, but there’s no guarantee that the instructions will be instantly obeyed. The service chiefs and combatant commanders who recently outranked him, and who command troops, might not bend. This would not necessarily amount to a public refusal; it could be accomplished by delays or failure to aggressively follow through. For example, the military has obligingly been taking down portraits and scrubbing its websites and curricula of Black and female faces, DEI language, and inclusive initiatives, but decisions about promoting or assigning personnel in the military’s million-plus ranks remain with lower-ranking commanders. While by no means color or gender blind, the military has been and will remain the most integrated institution in America. It is doubtful that orders from Trump’s White House will dramatically alter its culture.

If Trump or Hegseth, through Caine, push policies that top commanders consider unlawful or unwise, they may well be greeted with generous lip service and stubborn inaction. More likely, Caine would convey his objections to the White House himself, ready to be shown the door. For now, though, the president has thanked Caine by name—nickname, too—calling him “spectacular” after the bombing mission against Iran.

There are two schools of thought about how long this will last. Some who know Caine predict that his tenure will be rocky and short. Others believe that his remarkable social skills might see him through to the end of Trump’s presidency. He seems prepared either way. The real test might come if Caine is asked to lie, or to embrace one of Trump’s exaggerations. The president tests his subordinates this way. The supposed “obliteration” of Iran’s nuclear program—an assertion not yet backed by evidence—was one such test, which Hegseth passed but Caine sidestepped during the June 26 press conference. Will the chairman keep evading such a test, and for how long?

Caine exited his first military job—happily—with a swift verbal kick from his commander. No one will be surprised if his last military job ends the same way.

This article originally stated, incorrectly, that the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, and National Guard command troops. It also misstated that Dan Caine left active duty to become a White House fellow, and that he commanded the CIA's secret missions.

Jens Spahn, now a leading member of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc, is under pressure from opposition parties after the report by investigator Margaretha Sudhof suggested he intervened in procurement during the Covid-19 crisis, despite his statements to the contrary.

Following Sudhof's two-hour appearance in the Bundestag on Tuesday, Green politician Paul Piechotta said the controversy now amounts to ""testimony against testimony - and someone is lying.""

Ines Schwerdtner, leader of The Left, said the allegations against Spahn and the health ministry have been ""rather strengthened than eased.""

She called for a full committee of enquiry to be established to investigate the former government's conduct, a move that the current conservative-led administration has opposed.

At the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020, protective FFP2 masks were in extremely short supply, leading governments across the world to rush to secure masks.

Legal disputes over the procurement of masks are still threatening the German government, with potential liability running into the billions of euros.

Christian Haase, from Spahn's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said Sudhof's appearance before the committee had been about improving the ministry's litigation tactics for the ongoing proceedings.

Her comments were not about ""any accusations against former ministers,"" he said, condemning ""conspicary theories from The Left and the Greens.""

The committee intends to discuss the mask purchases again at the end of July."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/disasters-texas-flood-trump-reflexively-110026307.html,2025-07-08 12:30:00,"After disasters like the Texas flood, Trump reflexively blames Biden","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday drew a hard line against quickly blaming the government in the midst of a tragedy – in this case, thedeadly floods in Texas.

“Many Democrat elected officials are trying to turn this into a political game; it is not,” Leavitt said, amid suggestions linking the tragedy toTrump’s cuts to the National Weather Service.

She added: “I just do think those comments are depraved and despicable, especially when so many Americans are mourning the loss of their children.”

Less than 24 hours before Leavitt’s comments, though, it was her boss, Trump, who was levying blame – not on the incumbent government, but the previous one.

“If you look at that water situation,that was really the Biden setup,” Trump said.

Trump quickly clarified that he wasn’t actually blaming Biden – he cited the historic nature of the floods – but there is no question he was attempting to shift potential responsibility for any government missteps to his predecessor.

And indeed, this has become Trump’s M.O. When something bad happens – including tragedy – Trump’s reflex has been to blame his predecessor. And often, despite Leavitt’s admonishment, he casts blame very quickly.

After a tragic crash in the Potomac River near Washington, DC, in late January that killed 67 people, Trumpblamed the Biden administration and diversity, equity and inclusion(DEI) policies – despite no evidence forming anything close to such a link. He did so even as bodies were being pulled from the river.

In May, after more crashes and technical problems that in some cases traumatized air traffic controllers, Trump added that “Biden didn’t do a thing for four years.”

And just last week, Trump suggested air traffic controllers would have had better equipment, but “then Biden canceled the order when he came in.” The comment echoed previous ones from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

It’s not clear what Trump was referring to. Administrations have for decades declined to proactively modernize air traffic control. That included Trump proposalsthat were never enacted, the New York Times reported.

After an antisemitic firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado last month that led to dozens of injuries and eventually a death, Trump the next day blamed “Biden’s ridiculous Open Border Policy.”

Other top administration officials echoed that line, with White House adviser Stephen Miller calling the suspect an “illegal alien” who benefited from the Biden’s “suicidal immigration” policies.

The reality was more complex, asthe Atlantic reported. The Egyptian man had arrived in 2022 during the Biden administration, but he didn’t cross the border illegally. He instead arrived on a tourist visa that Trump’s first administration had frequently awarded, and then applied for asylum – a process that allows one to temporarily stay in the country. That application was still pending when the attacks occurred.

Trump came into office hailing his role in securing a ceasefire in Gaza.

After it fell apart in March, Trump was asked about aUNICEF reportthat more than 300 children had been killed and more than 600 had been injured in Gaza following the breakdown of ceasefire talks.

Asked who he blamed, Trump didn’t name Hamas or Israel, but instead Biden.

“I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had – as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich,” Trumptold Time magazine.

When asked about blaming Hamas instead, Trump plowed forward.

“I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal,” he said.

Trump promised to end the war between Ukraine and Russia instantly upon taking office. And when repeatedly questioned about the lack of results months into his second term, he will often fall back on calling it “Biden’s war.”

“This is Biden. This isn’t me,” Trump said Friday. “This is Biden’s war.”

When asked in April about recognizing Russian control of Crimea as part of a peace deal – a controversial part of the proposal that Ukraine publicly rejected – Trump said: “Crimea was given away by Barack Hussein Obama and by Biden.” Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, during former President Obama’s second term.

“You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden,” Trump said earlier in the month, adding: “I’m not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn’t say he’s done the greatest job.”

Trump’s blame-Biden refrain perhaps comes up most frequently regarding the economy, where Trump’s numbers have suffered. Trump returned to this line when the stock market sunk amid his tariff threats, when jobs numbers have come in low and when the gross domestic product had a bad quarter.

“We came in on January 20th, so this is Biden,” Trump said in late April. “And you could even say the next quarter is sort of Biden because it doesn’t just happen on a daily or an hourly basis.”

“This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” he said on Truth Social the same day. “I didn’t take over until January 20th.”

Trump had said just three months prior that a stock market increase at the time was due to the “Trump effect.”

By early May, Trump had removed any subtext from when he planned to blame Biden.

“I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy,” Trump told NBC News, “because he’s done a terrible job.”

(Polling suggests this has not worked. Apparently because of Trump’s economy-rocking tariff threats, Americans quickly tied the economy to his policies –more quickly than for other recent presidents.)

Perhaps no product has gotten more attention when it comes to inflation as the price of eggs. And when prices shot up early in Trump’s presidency, he blamed Biden.

“Under Biden, they soared like double, triple, quadruple. You couldn’t even get them,” Trump said in early April. “They were not available.”

He added in late April: “And when I took over, you remember the big thing with eggs? They hit me the first week, ‘Eggs, eggs, eggs,’ like it was my fault. I said, ‘I didn’t cause this problem. This problem was caused by Biden,” Trump said, adding: “Well, eggs are down 87% since I got involved.”

Egg prices are down, butnot 87% as Trumpclaimed.

And there is a very logical culprit for the rise in egg prices:a bird flu outbreak. But Trump chose instead to blame Biden.

One of Trump’s most puzzling efforts to blame Biden came amid one of the biggest scandals of his administration: Signal-gate.

While talking about his officials discussing highly sensitive military attack information on an unclassified messaging app back in March, Trump suggested some blame lie with Biden – for not launching the attack earlier.

“Joe Biden should have done this attack on Yemen, which is basically a certain group within Yemen, the Houthis, and this should have been done by Joe Biden and it wasn’t,” Trump said. “And that’s caused this world a lot of damage and a lot of problems.”

A park concessions employee tested positive for hantavirus, a respiratory virus that spreads through contact with infected rodent droppings, urine or saliva, according to a statement from the Grand Canyon National Park that was emailed to The Arizona Republic.

Hantaviruskilledthe later actor Gene Hackman's wife Betsy Arakawa, according to the New Mexico's chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell. Hackmantested negativefor hantavirus and instead died of natural causes, his autopsy said.

Also, a bat collected along the Colorado River near River Mile 143, which is near Kanab Creek Canyon, tested positive for rabies, the park said.

""Grand Canyon National Park has recently confirmed two separate cases of zoonotic disease within the park — one involving hantavirus and the other rabies — underscoring the importance of public awareness and proper safety precautions,"" the statement said.

Hantavirus cases were uncommon, but the disease remains present in the Southwest, the statement said.

""The employee is recovering at home, and park officials are reminding residents and visitors to take proper precautions when cleaning or spending time in areas where rodents may be present,"" the park said.

In the rabies incident, two people had physical contact with the bat that was collected, and they received medical evaluation and treatment, according to the statement.

""This case serves as a critical reminder that all mammals, including bats, skunks, and foxes, are susceptible to rabies— a disease that is almost always fatal if untreated, but entirely preventable with timely post-exposure medical care,"" the statement said.

Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted through simple contact, such as when peopletouch or feed wildlife, according to theNational Park Service. People can also be exposed through animal droppings, via fleas or ticks that their pets may have contracted from infected wildlife or by handling dead animals.

Often the diseases have flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, headache or chills. People were urged to seek medical attention right away if they suspect they've been exposed.

Authorities recommended that parkgoers keep a safe distance from wildlife, especially any animals that were acting strangely. Sick animals may be unusually friendly, or they may act aggressively toward humans, according to theArizona Game and Fish Department.

Most human deaths from rabies nationwide were caused by bats. In Arizona, foxes and skunks were also a common source of rabies infections, according toNPS. During outbreaks, they can infect other mammals, like cows, horses or household pets.

There have been fivepositive casesof hantavirus in Arizona so far in 2025, according to the Arizona Department of Health Services. At least two of those have beenfatal, ADHS said.

""Although contracting the virus is rare, 38% of cases are fatal,"" ADHS Assistant Director of Preparedness Nicole Witt said.

Arizona had 11 confirmed cases of hantavirus in 2024, five of which were fatal, ADHS said.

Most of the cases were in northern Arizona, with five in Apache County, three in Coconino County, two in Navajo County, and one in Pima County.

Seven of the cases were residents of the Navajo Nation, where the most common strain of the virus first emerged and led to ahistoric outbreak in 1993.

Pinal Countyissued a rabies advisoryin February after a gray fox tested positive in western Maricopa.

Gila County reported one bobcattested positivefor rabies in February.

Cochise County reported two cases of rabies in March in gray foxes that interacted with the community near Ramsey Canyon. Thecounty Sheriff's Office saidthat one was spotted near a local business during the day, and the other was reported as being aggressive toward people.

ATucson man was attackedMarch 23 by a coatimundi that was thought to have rabies, according to the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

A fox in Gila Countytested positivein April 2025 after displaying ""aggressive behavior.""

Avoid stirring up dust when cleaning. Use gloves and disinfectant, not dry sweeping.

Seal up holes and remove potential food sources that attract rodents.

While camping, avoid sleeping directly on the ground and keep campsites clean.

Rodent cleanup kits are available to park residents — contact Brady Dunne (928-638-7659) for more information.

Never approach or touch wildlife. Report sick or strangely behaving animals to dispatch at: 928-638-7805.

If you or someone in your group has had contact with a bat or wild animal, seek medical attention immediately.

While on river trips, sleep in tents when possible and avoid handling wildlife.

Ensure pets (in permitted areas) are vaccinated and leashed.

Hormel Foods is a meat-focused food maker that has lost 40% of its value since 2022.

Hormel is a Dividend King while Realty Income has hiked its dividend annually for three decades.

10 stocks we like better than Realty Income ›

Investors often use theS&P 500to track the performance of the stock market. But the index's real purpose is to be broadly representative of the U.S. economy; the committee overseeing the index selects 500 of the largest and most economically important U.S. companies for inclusion. That vetting process makes the S&P 500 a good fishing ground for stocks to buy.

Right now, two magnificent S&P dividend stocks are deeply out of favor despite remaining important, and profitable, businesses. Here's why you might want to buyRealty Income(NYSE: O)andHormel Foods(NYSE: HRL)and hold them forever.

The truth is that Realty Income is probably one of the most boring companies you'll find inthe real estate investment trust(REIT) sector. That, however, has long been one of the company's goals. It actually trademarked the nickname ""The Monthly Dividend Company,"" which speaks to its commitment to its payouts.

At this point, management has increased the dividend annually for 30 straight years, and also for the last 110 quarters. If you are looking for a dividend stock that is as reliable as a quartz watch, Realty Income should be on your buy list. Add in a 5.6%dividend yieldat the current share price -- well above the S&P 500 index's scant 1.3% yield -- and you might want to move it from your buy list and right into your portfolio.

The business backing those payouts is quite solid. Realty Income owns more than 15,600 single-unit properties across the United States and Europe, renting them out under triple net leases to companies across the retail and industrial sectors. It is the largest competitor in its space by a wide margin, which gives it scale advantages in raising growth capital and on the acquisition front.

However, the REIT's large scale can be a headwind, too -- it takes a lot of new properties to move the needle for it financially. But slow and steady probably won't be too big an issue for conservative income investors when you combine it with the lofty yield. And right now, this S&P 500 constituent is down by about 25% from the peak it reached prior to the coronavirus pandemic despite its reliable dividend growth. That's a buying opportunity if you think in decades rather than days.

Hormel Foods is not just in the S&P 500 index. It also happens to be on the list of Dividend Kings -- the small and exclusive club of companies that have increased their payouts annually for more than 50 consecutive years. Those elite companies have proven over time that they know how to manage through difficult periods while still rewarding investors well. The current period is one of those difficult times for Hormel, which is why the stock has fallen around 40% from its 2022 highs.

The price drop has pushed Hormel's dividend yield up to 3.8%, near its historical peak, which is why long-term dividend investors should be looking at the stock right now. But don't buy it before considering the reasons why this S&P 500 stock is so unloved on Wall Street at the moment.

The first is that Hormel is having some difficulties in passing all of its rising costs on to consumers. But other headwinds include the ongoing outbreak of avian flu, a slow rebound in China, and some early trouble with its acquisition of Planters. None of these problems individually is likely to upend the company's business over the long term, but it's facing them all at once.

That's far from ideal, but even so, it seems likely that this Dividend King will muddle through like it has so many times over the past five decades.

For example, Hormel is leaning into product innovation, which has been a strong suit for the company. It is also focused on increasing its efficiency as it works to streamline its operations, which will help reduce costs. And it is reworking its management team, bringing in new blood with experience both inside and outside of Hormel. That leadership team should be able to focus on the long term, too, because the company's largest shareholder is The Hormel Foundation, a philanthropic organization with a specific goal of ensuring the long-term survival of Hormel the company.

Simply put, food maker Hormel can take its time and do the right things for the business without worrying too much about what Wall Street thinks about its near-term results. If that sounds like the kind of business you want to have in your portfolio, then you might want to jump on this Dividend King despite the headwinds it faces.

Just because a company's stock price has fallen doesn't mean Wall Street is correctly assessing its long-term merits. Often, traders are taking a short-term view of things and ignoring both the company's history and its future potential. Realty Income and Hormel are both down as stocks but not out as companies. And that makes each one worth a close look for dividend investors with a buy-and-hold mentality.

Check UPC, lot codes and best-by dates to see if your food is part of a recall.

Recalled items should be disposed of, and you may need to disinfect surfaces in your kitchen.

When in doubt, contact your place of purchase or the FDA for questions about a specific product.

New fear unlocked: you see a food recall, and it’s actually a product that you regularly buy and keep stored in your kitchen. But how do you know if your specific item is affected? Sure, there’s a list of information to look for on the packaging, but what do these codes mean, and where do you even find them?

Here, we’re breaking down what exactly each product code means, including UPC, lot codes and establishment numbers. That way, you know where to look if you ever have to track down a number printed on a product's packaging—and you know what to do if you have a recalled item in your kitchen.

UPC stands for universal product code. It’s a 12-digit code that’s printed on the packaging of a product, and everything on the shelves has a unique UPC to help identify each product. This means that this is the most efficient way to tell if the item you have on hand has been recalled, as the UPC information is commonly shared for recalled products.

To find the UPC, simply look underneath the bar code on the packaging. The numbers printed below the bar code make up the UPC. While the spacing of the numbers on the code may vary from what’s published on the recall, if the numbers match the recalled UPC, your food is affected.

Lot codes are another type of code printed on food packaging, as it specifies exactly which batch the food or product was from in the manufacturing process. Lot codes are typically numerical and are shorter than a UPC, but they can be printed anywhere on the packaging. Usually, you can find the lot code near the product’s bar code or its best-by date. You can also check the recall to see if it gives more information on where to find the identifier.

In recalls, best-by or use-by dates are commonly provided. Even if the affected date has passed, be sure to check your freezer or refrigerator for recalled items. If your potentially impacted product is meat or cheese, the recall may also list affected establishment numbers, which are printed by the USDA’s mark of inspection on the packaging.

Specific retailers and states may be listed on the announcement, but recalls often expand to include a wider range of products. If you’re unsure, it’s always best to call your local place of purchase to see if the product you have is recalled. Oftentimes, grocery chains will send shoppers letters to notify them that they have purchased a recalled item.

If all of the recall information matches your impacted product, there are a few things you should do. First, remove the product from your home. This could mean disposing of the product or returning it to your place of purchase for a possible replacement or refund.

If you’re seeking a refund but don’t feel comfortable transporting a recalled food item, especially if it is connected to a foodborne illness outbreak, that is understandable. Contact your place of purchase for an alternative solution. It may be best to take pictures of the affected product or have the receipt available for proof of purchase.

Once the recalled item is gone, you should disinfect any surfaces that the food may have touched if it was recalled for undeclared allergens or for foodborne bacteria likeSalmonella,Listeria monocytogenesorE. coli. This means cleaning all countertops, shelves and refrigerator surfaces as well as cleaning or disposing of any food that the product may have touched. These bacteria can quickly spread to other food, surfaces and people, so this step is crucial. If you are experiencing any symptoms of foodborne illness like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness or stomach cramps, consult a healthcare professional immediately.

For questions or concerns about a specific recalled product, it’s best to contact the number or email address provided on the recall announcement, or call the Food and Drug Administration at 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332). It’s important to stay up to date on the latest food recalls, andEatingWellis adamant in providing the latest information. You can find all of ourrecently reported food recalls here.

Cole’s French Diprecently announcedit would be closing for good due to a “litany of reasons,” including the coronavirus pandemic, strikes in Hollywood, an uptick in crime and an increase in costs for labor, goods and rent. The bar previously hidden in the back of Cole’s, The Varnish, closed due to mounting costs in 2024.

A longtime staple of L.A., the 117-year-old downtown L.A. establishment claims to be the birthplace of the French Dip sandwich. Another local restaurant, Philippe the Original, also claimed to be the birthplace of the French Dip; however, the City of Los Angeles designated Cole’s as a historical landmark site in 1974 and recognized them as the true inventor of the sandwich,according to the Cole’s website.

Another Los Angeles staple, Langer’s Delicatessen, is now paying homage to its food serving compatriot. In recent times, Langer’s has struggled too – evenconsidering closing at one point– and the restaurant was forced to add a 50-cent surcharge on eggs earlier this year; the surcharge wasdropped late last monthafter the avian flu outbreak that caused the rise in egg prices was contained.

“It is with profound sadness and a deep sense of nostalgia that I learned about the impending closure of Cole’s French Dip – a beloved Los Angeles institution that has stood the test of time for more than a century,” Langer’s owner, Norm Langer, said in a statement to KTLA. “Founded before Prohibition, Cole’s wasn’t just a restaurant – it was a fixture of downtown Los Angeles and a second home to generations of Angelenos.”

“It was the kind of place where you could find a warm meal, a good drink and a friendly face, even in the late hours of the night,” Langer continued.

The Langer’s owner sympathized with Cole’s management on the reasons for the closure, saying that independent restaurants across the country have “faced extraordinary challenges.”

“As we’ve seen in recent years – through the pandemic, rising crime, increased operating costs and an ever-growing tangle of bureaucracy – independent restaurants have faced extraordinary challenges,” he said. “Langer’s has felt those pressures too. I’m heartsick that Cole’s, with all its history and heart, could not only survive but continue to thrive.”

Langer went on to describe Cole’s — founded in 1908, 39 years before Langer’s opened its doors in 1947 – as a piece of the city’s soul and a crown jewel.

“Its absence will be felt by all who value tradition, resilience and the unique cultural fabric that made this city great,” he said.

Ahead of the closure of Cole’s, the restaurant is inviting the public to stop by and enjoy a final meal in the historic establishment. It should be noted that Cole’s, the city’s oldest operating restaurant and bar, is 21+ after 7 p.m.

“We have cherished our time serving the downtown community and will continue to craft great drinks and our renowned French dip sandwiches until we shutter. We care deeply about our family of staff and are immensely grateful for our amazing guests who have supported Cole’s over the years,” the restaurant said in a statement to KTLA on Monday.

Cole’s will officially close its doors on Aug. 3.

Picture this. You stopped at your local grocery store on the way home from work to pick up a few things for dinner, including arotisserie chicken, a jar of dressing, and a bag of chopped romaine lettuce. Sometime after, you and your family are unexpectedly sick, and you imagine that chicken must have been undercooked. As it turns out, that bag of healthy, crisp lettuce was the culprit.

Large-scale outbreaks ofcontaminated leafy greenslike spinach and romaine have made headlines in recent years, and some food safety experts are concerned that regulatory changes may actually make things more challenging for consumers. As of this February, there were two active investigations, includingone linked to lettuce contaminated with E. colithat infected 88 people.

This was just one of many outbreaks last year that sickened a great number of people. According to the watchdog group U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund’s new report, ""Food for Thought 2025."" But what is it about bagged lettuce that actually makes food safety experts concerned?

""Eating vegetables, including leafy greens, is an important part of a healthy, balanced diet, but food safety experts often avoid prepackaged salads, because they can be riskier than a whole head of lettuce,"" explains Dr. Vanessa Coffman, director of theAlliance to Stop Foodborne Illness.

How could bagged or prepackaged salads pose more of a risk than aregular head of lettuce? Coffman likens it to ground meat, as ""packaged greensare typically from multiple sources and processed together, which increases the chance that contamination from one batch is spread across many bags."" The actual cutting process could even trap and spread harmful pathogens.

In addition to the processing of precut or bagged lettuce mixes, thepackage itself could pose a risk, explains Dr. Darin Detwiler, associate teaching professor at Northeastern University College of Professional Studies, and author ofFood Safety: Past, Present, and Predictions. He says moisture in packaging can ""create an ideal environment for bacteria like E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella."" Temperature changes during transport and storage can also allow pathogens to multiply.

""Packaged lettuce, salad greens, and spinach are especially vulnerable to contamination due to multiple points of risk throughout the food supply chain,"" Coffman explains. ""Contamination can occur as early as the farm level. Fields may be exposed to harmful bacteria from nearby livestock operations, wild animals, workers, or contaminated irrigation water if proper food safety protocols aren’t strictly followed.""

Contaminated water from nearby livestock is often the source of outbreaks. Key regulatory changes to the Food and Drug Administration’s revised implementation timeline for theFood Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule, Subpart E, which addresses agricultural water standards, may impact such outbreaks. Detwiler explains that the updated rule places more of the onus on assessing water quality on farms and growers, rather than simply requiring strict microbial limits, such as the thresholds for E. coli.

While this shift aims to be more science-based and even adaptable to different farming practices, Detwiler notes, ""some experts are concerned that looser timelines and risk-based assessments could lead to inconsistent on-farm monitoring, especially for crops like leafy greens, which are often consumed raw and are highly vulnerable to contamination."" In other words, the new rule provides greater flexibility but also more responsibility for growers.

He also adds, “From a food safety perspective, I am cautiously concerned. The move toward flexible, risk-based assessments places more responsibility on growers to identify and mitigate hazards, rather than following strict, measurable standards. While this might improve long-term practices on large, well-resourced farms, smaller operations or those under weak oversight may not adequately manage water quality, increasing the chance of contamination.""

Most recently,a deadly outbreak of contaminated romaine lettuceimpacted 15 states last November, but the public wasn’t notified in a timely manner. ""While the FDA did eventually issue a warning, the response lacked clarity and urgency,"" Coffman recalls. ""Consumers were told to 'avoid romaine lettuce,' without details about which brands, regions, or growers were affected—because the agency never publicly named the implicated firms.""

Coffman went on to state, ""This kind of vagueness undermines consumer trust. We want people to feel confident choosing fresh produce, but when they can’t be sure what’s safe, it affects both home cooks and the broader food industry.""

The FDA has also experiencedbudget cuts and reduction in force, though it’s unclear at this time how this will impact food safety inspections.

""With the current administration’s reduction in force efforts, we know that huge numbers of agency communication staff have been let go,"" Coffman explains. ""At a time when transparent, accurate messaging can literally save lives, cutting the very people responsible for getting critical information to the public is deeply troubling.""

One important caveat to the potential for danger associated withbagged lettucesis indoor-grown greens. A spokesperson fromGotham Greens, a fresh food company operating sustainable greenhouses across the country, says that while no product can ever be completely isolated from risk, indoor-grown leafy greens have guardrails against contamination that’s not typically possible with many field-grown greens found in bagged lettuces.

These guardrails include farming in a controlled environment using hydroponic greenhouses. The greens are not exposed to things like agricultural runoff or animal waste, the water is filtered and treated as part of the growing method, and the company’s water monitoring program helps ensure the water is free of harmful pathogens.

Regular lab testing and monitoring to comply with FSMA requirements include regular sampling and testing of the water and physical environment.

""While there haven’t been regulatory rollbacks that inherently makebagged lettuce unsafeto eat, the way risks are assessed, communicated, and managed may look different than they have in the past,"" explains Katie Sabatini, RD, LDN, and Food Safety & Quality Assurance expert atLittle Leaf Farms, which produces green house grown lettuces.

These regulatory shifts may not makebagged lettuceinherently less safe, but ""consumers should stay informed about where their greens are coming from and keep in mind that'pre-washed' lettuceisn’t contamination-proof,"" Sabatini says. ""The majority of producers are deeply committed to food safety and there are strong systems in place to minimize risk.""

Measles cases in the United States have reached a record high since the infection was eliminated in 2000.

Data published by theJohns Hopkins University Center for Outbreak Response Innovation(CORI) state that 1,285 measles cases have been reported in the U.S. in 2025.

Of those cases, 792 were reported in Texas, while 95 were in New Mexico and 86 in Kansas.

Cases have also been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, per theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).

According toThe Washington PostandCNN, the U.S. has surpassed infections reported in 2019, when there were 1,274 cases. Before, the highest number of reported measles cases was over 2,100 people in 1992.

Worldwide, CORI stated, there was a ""significant increase"" in measles cases in 2019, with 869,770 cases.

Prior to the vaccine, between 3 million and 4 million people were infected with measles in the U.S. each year, and 400 to 500 people died annually,according to the CDC.

Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, per the CDC, meaning there were no new cases reported for over 12 months.

Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Araghchi’s talks with Prince Mohammed and other Saudi officials on Tuesday were “fruitful”.

The visit after the 12-day intense conflict between Israel and Iran, which saw the United States bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities before mediating a ceasefire, suggests that the war did not derail the rapprochement between Tehran and Riyadh.

Saudi Arabia’s official news agency, SPA, said Araghchi and Prince Mohammed “reviewed bilateral relations and discussed the latestregional developmentsand the efforts being made in that regard”.

“The Crown Prince expressed the Kingdom’s aspiration that the ceasefire agreement would contribute to creating conditions that promote security and stability in the region, emphasizing the Kingdom’s stance in supporting dialogue through diplomatic means as a path to resolving disputes,” SPA said.

It added that Araghchi expressed his gratitude to the kingdom for “condemning the Israeli aggression”.

The top Iranian diplomat also met with Saudi Minister of Defence Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz and Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.

Israel launched a massive bombardment against Iran on June 13, without direct provocation, killing top military commanders and nuclear scientists as well as hundreds of civilians.

Iran retaliated with missile barrages that left widespread destruction in Israel.

After the US targeted Iran’s nuclear sites, Tehran responded with a missile launch against a US airbase in Qatar. Shortly after that attack, US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

While Arab countries condemned the attack as a violation of Qatar’s sovereignty, Iran appears to be pushing to repair relations with Gulf states.

Ties between Tehran and Riyadh were strained for years over disagreements around regional conflicts and mutual accusations of spreading instability.

But the two countries agreed to restore formal relations aspart of a dealbrokered by China in 2023, and top Saudi and Iranian officials have been in regular contact.

Before the outbreak of the recent war, Saudi Arabia had welcomedIran’s nuclear talkswith the US, saying it supported efforts to resolve regional and international disputes.

On Monday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he believed Tehran could resolve its differences with the US through dialogue, but trust would be an issue after the attacks on his country.

In an article published by the Financial Times earlier on Tuesday, Araghchi accused Israel of preferring conflict over diplomacy.

“Iran remains interested in diplomacy, but we have good reason to have doubts about further dialogue,” he wrote. “If there is a desire to resolve this amicably, the US should show genuine readiness for an equitable accord.”"

The vaccines are intended to be developedfor use againstMarburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus, two hemorrhagic fevers in the same family as theEbola virus,which can cause uncontrolled bleeding and death.

Apre-solicitation noticewas posted to a government contracting website on June 27 by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

BARDA is a center within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within HHS which isresponsible for the development of medical countermeasures– principally bioterrorism.

The notice of the new vaccines comes as Kennedycontinues his overhaul of the departmentand makes cuts to research on infectious diseases.

A known vaccine skeptic, he recently canned the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, in order to restore ""public trust above any pro or anti-vaccine agenda,” he said.

The ACIP is responsible for evaluating the safety, efficacy and clinical need of vaccines and then presenting its findings to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kennedy removed all 17 committee members last month and replaced them with several people who have also been critical of vaccines, saying his picks were “committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense.”

The new vaccine proposals demonstrate an awareness within HHS of the dangers posed by furtheroutbreaksof serious disease and the consequences of being unprepared.

The pre-solicitation notice notes that the Filovirus family, which includes Marburg virus and the Ebola and Sudan viruses, “are known to cause severe health consequences, including death, in humans” and that infections with EBOV, SUDV, and MARV “can lead to case fatality rates of up to 90 percent.”

The immediate need for MARV and SUDV vaccines has been emphasized by recent outbreaks, according to BARDA, which cites the SUDV outbreak in 2022 that resulted in 141 confirmed cases and 55 deaths.

Additionally, a MARV outbreak in 2024 led to 66 confirmed cases and 15 deaths.

The Marburg and Sudan ebolavirus vaccines that BARDA has proposed are not mRNA vaccines – which have been a specific target of Kennedy’s skepticism during thecoronavirus pandemic."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/mosquitoes-thriving-tampa-bay-inside-093000844.html,2025-07-09 11:30:00,Mosquitoes are thriving in Tampa Bay. Inside the effort to stave them off.,"CLEARWATER — The girls were squawking.

One bawk turned into a chorus of squeals.

“I’ve never seen them do this before,” said Austin Deal, an entomologist assistant with Pinellas County Mosquito Control. When he nestled a hen under his arm just a few minutes earlier, she barely made a peep.

“We’ve been in here too long without giving them treats,” he said.

The ladies — dozens of Red Star hens shuffling around the enclosed chicken coop at the main Pinellas County Mosquito Control lot — were purchased months ago as chicks, chosen for their (typically) docile nature.

Eventually, each hen will find her way to one of eight coops across the county, where each Monday, employees will draw about a milliliter of blood.

The chickens will find themselves unwitting recruits in the war on mosquitoes. If one of three diseases shows up in their blood, officials know that the disease is present in nearby mosquitoes.

Chickens are just one strand in the large web of monitoring mosquito populations and the viruses they may carry. Across Florida, more than 60 mosquito control programs have their own methods and capabilities to combat the pests.

While mosquitoes are active year-round in Florida, it’s now — when the hot, wet weather really kicks in — that they thrive.

And as climate change prolongs warm weather and brings more intense storms, Florida’s environment will only become more hospitable to the little suckers.

To get a closer look at the conflict, the Tampa Bay Times toured mosquito control centers across the region.

Tucked behind a chain-link fence, the Pinellas County Mosquito Control resides near an industrial park in Clearwater.

It’s a complex where buildings, including a hangar that houses a helicopter, are surrounded by Florida-friendly plants, a beehive, mosquito-eating fish in buckets and, of course, the chicken coop.

Workers often head into the field, where they tend to the chickens across the county. They place mosquito traps that simulate bodily emissions to draw mosquitoes, such as dry ice to imitate human breath and a device that stinks like sweat.

“There’s a lot of technology that’s come a long way, but the true old way is still the best way,” said Jason Stuck, a 27-year mosquito control employee. “You get out there with your boots … and go find them.”

Mosquitoeskill more people than any other animal on the planet, according to Gordon Patterson, a professor at the Florida Institute of Technology and author of “The Mosquito Wars.”

Centuries ago, Florida, particularly along the coasts, was deemed nearly uninhabitable because of the insects. The state was plagued by epidemics of dengue and yellow fever.

Dozens of mosquito control districts now exist across Florida, including in Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco. While operations are similar, they aren’t identical. For example, Pinellas and Hillsborough’s mosquito control are run within the county, while Pasco’s is an independentspecial districtfinanced by its own property tax.

It means mosquito control methods and budgets can vary widely across a state where about 90 mosquito species live.

In Pinellas, workers return daily with the traps and spread the dead insects on a piece of paper. With tweezers, they parse through what resembles a mound of fake eyelashes, counting and documenting the mosquitoes by hand.

Only some mosquitoes carry diseases. In Pinellas County, there are 40 species of mosquitoes but just 17 that officials say pose a serious concern.

Mosquito control can calculate how many mosquitoes land on a person in a minute. When it reaches around 10, then there’s likely a problem, said Alissa Berro, director of Pinellas County Vegetation Management and Mosquito Control.

Some staff are so accustomed to bites that they’ve developed an immunity to mosquito saliva, which can cause itchy, splotchy marks, said Caroline Scott, a senior environmental specialist for Pinellas County.

But not all mosquitoes bite people. Some take their “blood meals” (the unfortunate way researchers describe how mosquitoes feed) from birds, reptiles or even leeches, Berro said. The bloodsuckers are all female.

Trapping and identification is crucial for mosquito control to measure populations and plan how to handle them.

The mosquitoes that officials typically look out for are the ones that carry diseases, like malaria, dengue or West Nile, among others.

Thanks to mosquito control and air-conditioned homes, these diseases have become uncommon in the state.

However, one virus has caught the attention of Kristi Miley, a researcher at the University of South Florida.

Dengue cases have more than tripled in the state over the past five years.

From about 2010 to 2018, there were about 800 cases in which someone was bitten elsewhere but found to be sick in Florida, and about 100 in which someone was bitten in the state. From 2019 to 2024, travel-related cases increased to more than 3,000, and locally acquired cases jumped to more than 400. That rise could be higher considering that last year’s data may not be complete, Miley said.

“This is starting to be concerning,” she said.

Pasco County saw 11 cases of travel-related dengue and 13 cases of locally acquired dengue in 2024.

“Dengue is no longer a travel-related issue,” said Adriane Rogers, executive director of Pasco County Mosquito Control District, in an email to the Times.

Dengue has four different strains. If a person is infected with one strain, they may experience flu-like symptoms. If they are infected with a different strain later on, their immunity for the virus is lower and, in rare cases, they can die.

“The rise in local cases means we all have a role to play — from public health officials and clinicians to everyday residents,” Rogers said, adding that mosquito-borne diseases often go unreported.

Miley and her team are creating a model that predicts the risk of dengue in Florida based on weather factors and land use.

“At the end of the day, you have this risk model that potentially could be offered to mosquito control as a way to be more proactive,” she said.

It’s difficult because there is no uniform reporting of mosquito populations across the state. Miley relies on mosquito programs to offer their data.

Mosquito control officials in Florida meet annually to discuss trends and methodologies, and they often collaborate when an outbreak is occurring across county lines.

But mosquito control programs are ultimately silos, Miley said.

In Tampa Bay, there’s typically a layered approach to attacking mosquitoes. The easiest and most effective way is getting to them before they can fly.

When they’re flying, “they’re hard to trap, and they’re also biting people and possibly spreading disease,” Scott said.

Mosquitoes need water to breed. Without it, they can’t thrive.

Most mosquito control programs breed mosquito-eating fish and give them out to the public for free. The fish, aptly named mosquitofish, have spoon-shaped mouths that can suck up the larvae wriggling on the water’s surface.

Mosquito officials also use larvicides and insecticides to target the insects. They often rear the bugs in-house to test their resistance levels, sometimes at state labs.

Mosquito control officials in Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco also respond to public requests to fight mosquito populations.

There are certain criteria, like a high number of mosquitoes found in an area, before mosquito officials can spray a larger area than a requested home or business, Berro said.

Officials use people, vans or even helicopters to treat areas where mosquitoes have become an issue.

Florida’s warm weather means mosquitoes can survive through the seasons. Heat combined with rainfall can influence a mosquito’s life cycle.

In the summer, mosquitoes can go from egg to adult in three to five days. In the winter, it could take a week or longer.

The average lifespan of an adult mosquito can be anywhere from two weeks to two months, Scott said.

And climate change is extending warmer weather seasons, allowing mosquito populations to thrive longer.

Hurricanes can also prolong mosquitoes’ active time, dumping more rain and leading to more standing water.

“We’ve seen a vast increase in these extreme weather patterns, and the last couple of hurricane seasons have left a lot of debris,” Miley said.

Storm debris can sit out for weeks, providing a perfect breeding ground. That’s why experts say it’s so important to drain standing water.

Eradicating mosquitoes is not the goal, Rogers said. Some populations are pollinators or food sources for other animals. Instead, mosquito control seeks to keep dangerous populations at bay.

“It’s a delicate balance,” Rogers said.

The effort to hold back mosquito populations in Florida is massive. There is no silver bullet, Rogers said.

Instead, there are myriad methods, from complex science and expensive equipment to the sentinel chickens — still oblivious to their role in the persistent battle.

Just over halfway through 2025, the U.S. has now surpassed2019's total number of infections, when 1,274 measles cases were confirmed, which at the time was the highest in more than a quarter century.

This is now the worst year for measles in the U.S. since 1992, when 2,126 cases were confirmed. The virus was officiallydeclared eliminatedin the U.S. in 2000, after high rates of vaccination succeeded at halting nearly all domestic spread.

Maps show measles cases across U.S., Texas

The largest share ofthis year's infectionsare connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led tothe deathsoftwo children. The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to more than750. Measles infections have been confirmed in 38 states.

In a statement to CBS News, the CDC said the risk of measles infection is low for the overall population, noting that the U.S. case rate is lower than other countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy.

""Measles risk is higher in U.S. communities with low vaccination rates in areas with active measles outbreaks or with close social and/or geographic linkages to areas with active measles outbreaks,"" the statement said, adding, ""CDC continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles.""

How measles cases spread

Themeaslesvirus is airborne and is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. A person can be contagious for several days before they develop the rash that often accompanies measles, the CDC says. The virus spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or even just breathes, and it can continue to infect others in the area for up to two hours after the infected person leaves.

Measles is primarily a respiratory virus, and in some cases it can causesevere infectionsin the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. Butthe vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, issafe and highly effectiveat preventing it, doctors and health experts say.

Before the first measles vaccine became available in the 1960s, between 400 and 500 Americans — mostly children —died every year from measles.

Health experts point tolower vaccination ratesas a reason for the increase in measles. Nationwide, a recent study found theMMR vaccination rate decreasedfrom 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year, looking at county-level data in 33 states. A 95% vaccination rate is needed for herd immunity, which prevents outbreaks.

The Texas outbreak was originally centered in arural Mennonite communitywith a lower vaccination rate, and most of those affected have beenchildren and teenagers, nearly all of whom wereunvaccinatedor had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. The death ofone adultin New Mexico was also linked to measles.

Measles symptoms

Initial measles symptomsinclude fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash that begins to develop a few days later.

While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.

There is no antiviral drug or treatment that can cure measles, but medical care can help relieve symptoms. Doctors have some treatment options available to address complications like pneumonia or bacterial infections that can develop in measles patients.

Measlesis making a comeback in the U.S., reaching alarming levels not seen since it was declared eliminated in 2000.

According to datafrom Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Outbreak Response Innovation (CORI), 1,285 cases of measles have been reported in 2025, marking the highest number since the infection’s elimination. The outbreak has been particularly severe in Texas, with 792 cases, followed by New Mexico with 95 and Kansas with 86. Additional cases have been reported across multiple states, including California, Florida, Illinois, and New York.

The highest recorded number of cases occurred in 1992, when over 2,100 individuals were infected. Globally, 2019 also saw a sharp rise in measles, with nearly 870,000 cases reported, according to CORI. The current surge has surpassed the previous record of 1,274 cases in 2019.

Before the vaccine,the CDC statesmeasles infected between 3 million and 4 million people annually in the U.S., leading to hundreds of deaths each year. Although measles was declared eliminated in 2000, the current spike has raised concerns about the effectiveness of public health measures and vaccination efforts.

According to Dr. Paul Offit, who spoke withThe Guardianon July 7, the “outbreak has been severely underestimated,” and that the cases so far are just the “tip of a much bigger iceberg.”

Symptoms of measles can include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a red rash that can spread across the body. If you experience any of those listed, seek medical attention immediately.

(File/Getty Images)

One person in the Upstate tested positive for measles, marking the first South Carolina case for 2025, the state Department of Public Health said Wednesday.

The case comes amid a national outbreak of the disease, with more cases nationwide in the first half of 2025 than have been reportedsince 1992,eight years before measles was considered eliminated. Three people have died from measles in the country this year — two in Texas and one in New Mexico — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The South Carolina resident, who was unvaccinated and had not previously had measles, was exposed during an international trip and is isolating at home to prevent spreading the virus, according to the public health agency.

The department has notified people who were potentially exposed, and public health officials “have no reason to believe at this time that this case will spark an outbreak in our state,” said Brannon Traxler, the department’s chief medical officer.

The department declined to provide other information, including the person’s age and county of residence, because of privacy concerns.

Another person in the state, also from the Upstate, was confirmed to have measlesin September 2024following another international trip. The state had six cases reported in 2018, with no other cases since 1997, Traxler said.

The disease is highly infectious and can be fatal, especially in children, Traxler said.

Symptoms often begin with a fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash that usually lasts five or six days. In severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia and brain swelling, according to the health department.

Vaccination against measles is highly effective, according to the public health department.

Children typically receive two doses of the measles vaccine, the first between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second between 4 and 6 years.

The rate of vaccination for school-age children in South Carolina has decreased slightly in recent years, falling from about 96% during the 2020-2021 school year to just under 94% in 2024-2025,according to the health department.

As for the measles vaccine specifically, 92% of kindergarteners during the 2023-24 school year had received at least one dose, according to the most recent data available. That’s on par with the national average of kindergarteners who received the vaccine that year, according to the CDC."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/first-mrna-vaccine-marburg-shows-154459766.html,2025-07-09 17:15:00,First mRNA vaccine for Marburg shows promise in animal trial,"The pharmaceutical giant Moderna is developing the first mRNA vaccine to protect againstMarburg, a close but even deadlier cousin of Ebola.

The haemorrhagic fever, which transmits to humans via fruit bats before rapidly spreading person to person, has caused several lethal outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa – most recently killing 10 people inTanzania earlier this year.

While Marburg kills more than half of those it infects, there are currently no licenced vaccines or treatments available to tackle it, posing a significant challenge to outbreak response.

Researchers at the University of Texas and Moderna say a new vaccine developed using mRNA technology (used during the pandemic to quickly deliver Covid vaccines) provided full protection against Marburg in a pre-clinical trial carried out on rodents.

The new immunisation produced “strong neutralising antibodies” and “importantly, no virus was detectable in the blood of vaccinated animals after exposure – suggesting sterilising immunity,” the study said.

“The fact that we achieved complete protection in all vaccinated animals is a major leap,” said Dr Alexander Bukreyev, an author of the study.

“Moderna’s mRNA platform is proving to be very potent when targeting highly lethal pathogens,” added Dr Andrea Carfi, a researcher at the pharmaceutical company.

The jabs will still need to go through rigorous human trials before being licenced for use.

Marburg disease belongs to the Filovirus family, a group of viruses which includes Ebola. It is naturally carried by fruit bats, and can ‘jump’ to humans via the animals’ bites or contact with the animals’ urine or saliva.

Once a person is infected, the virus tends to spread rapidly, mainly through contact with the bodily fluids of a sickened person.

Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle pains, diarrhoea, vomiting, and bleeding under the skin and from the eyes.

The virus was first recognised after simultaneous outbreaks occurred in laboratories in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Belgrade, in 1967.

A group of at least 30 lab workers all came into contact with the bodily fluids of a batch of imported African green monkeys from Uganda and became severely unwell.

Seven of the lab workers subsequently died, before the virus’s origins were traced back to the monkeys.

Since, outbreaks have occurred sporadically and have all occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in countries including Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, and Uganda.

However, the frequency of outbreaks has been increasing in recent years with at least one cluster of cases occurring every year since 2021.

Scientists suggest that part of the reason for the uptick in cases is related to human encroachment on previously undisturbed habitats which gives more of an opportunity for the virus to spillover from animals to humans.

In January of this year, 10 people in Tanzania were reported to be infected with Marburg virus – all of which died.

Biharamulo district, the area in which the virus spread, is home to several large gold mines and it was suspected that the index case was infected by a bat while working in a mine.

Rwanda also experienced an outbreak of Marburgin September last year – the first ever to be reported in the country – in which 16 people died, mostlyhealthcare workersin the capital city, Kigali.

US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr quietly announced last month that the Department of Health and Human Services would develop two new vaccines – one for use against Marburg virus and one against Sudan virus, a type of Ebola.

The two jabs are in the early stages of development but, unlike Moderna’s vaccine, they do not use mRNA technology – which has come under fire from Mr Kennedy and his vaccine sceptic allies since the Covid-19 pandemic.

We apologize for the errors.

LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) — Already this year, 855 kids have been diagnosed with whooping cough in Michigan. 150 of those were children who were two years old or younger. According to doctors, many cases were preventable with safe and effective vaccines.

Doctors say this comes as there is confusion for both parents and medical providers about changes happening at the federal level when it comes to vaccine recommendations.

“Patient confusion, yes, many, many patients have questions, and we are also confused, because there is some mixed messaging coming out of the federal government,” said Dr. Pamela Rockwell, Family Physician and Chair of the Michigan Advisory Committee on Immunizations.

She says infants and young children are at the highest risk for serious illness, hospitalization, or worse.

“And these are easily preventable diseases with vaccines that have been proven by years of research and data mining, to be safe and effective,” Rockwell said.

Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. Today, there are 36 states including Michigan that are currently experiencing outbreaks, and less than 80% of toddlers are vaccinated for measles, according to the MDHHS.

“You really need a vaccine coverage or an immunity coverage of about 95 percent in a given population in order to prevent an outbreak, so we are well below that threshold,” said Ryan Malosh, director of the divisions of immunization with MDHHS.

Dr. Joshua Meyerson is a Pediatrician and Medical Director for the Health Department of Northwest Michigan. He says misinformation is leading to a lack of trust between parents and providers.

“They’re hearing a lot of things and they’re getting things from perhaps the media that they watch and consume or their social networks, so to speak, or from their neighbors, and they’re hearing things that concern them, and they have a lack of trust.”

Dr. Meyerson says to combat misinformation his priority is transparency and making parents feel comfortable about asking any questions they might have.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-gaza-ceasefire-must-010639055.html,2025-07-10 02:30:00,"If Trump wants Gaza ceasefire, he must pressure Netanyahu, experts say","Washington, DC –The White House says Donald Trump’s “utmost priority” in the Middle East is to end the war in Gaza. But as the United States president hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, the two leaders have heaped praise on each other.

Meanwhile, Israel continues its assault on the Palestinian territory, where more than 57,575 people have been killed.

Analysts say that if Trump is truly seeking a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, he must leverage US military aid to Israel to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a deal.

Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group nonprofit, drew a parallel between Trump’s mixed messaging and that of his predecessor,Joe Biden. Both men, he said, called for a ceasefire but showed unwillingness to press Israel to end the fighting.

“It’s like deja vu with the Biden administration, where you would hear similar pronouncements from the White House,” said Finucane.

“If a ceasefire is indeed the ‘utmost priority’ of the White House, it has the leverage to bring it about.”

The US provides Israel with billions of dollars in military assistance each year, on top of offering itdiplomatic backingat international forums like the United Nations.

While US officialsexpressed optimismabout reaching a 60-day truce this week that could lead to a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahu told reporters in Washington, DC, that Israel has “still to finish the job in Gaza” and eliminate the armed group Hamas.

Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, described Netanyahu’s comments as “maximalist rhetoric” and “bluster”, stressing that Trump could push Israel to stop the war.

He said Trump could use the “threat of suspension of military support” to achieve the ceasefire, “which very much would be in the interest of the United States and the interest of the president himself in terms of scoring a diplomatic win”.

Netanyahu arrived in Washington, DC, on Monday and took a “victory lap” with Trump to celebrate their jointattack on Iran’s nuclear facilitiesduring a 12-day war last month.

From the start, the Israeli prime minister appeared to play to Trump’s ego. As he sat down to a White House dinner on Monday night, Netanyahu announced he had nominated the US president for a Nobel Peace Prize.

The two leadersmet againon Tuesday, with Trump saying that their talks would be all about Gaza and the truce proposal.

A day later, Netanyahu said he and Trump were “in lockstep” over Gaza.

“President Trump wants a deal, but not at any price,” the Israeli prime minister said. “I want a deal, but not at any price. Israel has security requirements and other requirements, and we’re working together to try to achieve it.”

But Annelle Sheline, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said that Israel is the party standing in the way of a ceasefire. She noted that Hamas has already demanded a lastingend to the war, which is what the Trump administration says it is seeking.

“While we know Trump has said he wants a ceasefire, thus far, we’ve not seen Trump being willing to use America’s extensive leverage to actually get there,” Sheline told Al Jazeera.

Far from stopping the flow of arms to Israel, the Trump administration has taken pride in resuming the transfer of heavy bombs – the only weapons that Biden temporarily withheld during the war on Gaza.

While truce talks are ongoing, the horrors of Israel’s war on Gaza, whichUN expertsand rights groups have described as a genocide, are intensifying.

Hospitals are runningout of fuel, cases ofpreventable diseasesare on the rise, hunger is rampant, and hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire over the past weeks while trying to receive food at US-backed, privately-run aid distribution sites.

Nancy Okail, the president of the Center for International Policy, said that Trump appears to be interested in a Gaza ceasefire in part to boost his own image as a peacemaker and to win a Nobel Peace Prize.

During the presidential campaign, Trump promised to bring peace to the world, seizing on Americans’ weariness of war after the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

But so far, he has failed to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. And he oversaw the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran, evenordering the US’s participationin it.

The US president took credit for a Gaza truce that came into effect in January, only tolet it unravelas he supported Israel’s decision to resume the war in March.

Okail said the atrocities in Gaza could not be stopped with just verbal calls for a ceasefire.

“If it is not accompanied by action – as in the suspension of aid or suspension of arms to Israel – Netanyahu doesn’t have any reason to actually go forward seriously with the peace negotiations,” she told Al Jazeera.

Even if a 60-day truce is reached, rights advocates are concerned that Israel may not only return to war afterwards, but it might also use the time to drive Palestinians out of Gaza and further entrench its occupation.

Hamas said on Wednesdaythat it had agreedto release 10 Israeli captives as part of the proposed deal, but the remaining sticking points are about the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and guarantees for a permanent ceasefire.

Before Netanyahu arrived in Washington, DC, Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz revealed a plan to create an internment camp for Palestinians in southern Gaza, according to the newspaperHaaretz.

The publication quoted Katz as saying that Israel would implement an “emigration plan” to remove Palestinians from Gaza, which rights groups say would amount to ethnic cleansing, a crime against humanity.

The idea of depopulating Gaza is not new. Far-right Israeli ministers have been publicly championing it since the start of the war. But the international community started taking the idea seriously whenTrump floated itin February as part of his desire to turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.

Netanyahu brought it up again during his visit, saying that Palestinians in Gaza should be free to leave the territory if they choose.

While the Trump administration has not re-endorsed the ethnic cleansing scheme in Gaza this week, the White House still suggested that Palestinians cannot remain in the territory.

“This has become an uninhabitable place for human beings, and the president has a big heart,” Trump’s spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters.

“He wants this to be a prosperous, safe part of the region where people and families can thrive.”​​

Rights advocates have stressed that people under bombardment and with no access to basic necessities cannot have a “free” choice to stay or leave a place.

Sheline said that the international fears that Trump and Netanyahu are working to ethnically cleanse Gaza and displace its Palestinian residents elsewhere are warranted.

“There was a lot of discussion of the idea that maybe because theUS helped Israelwith its war on Iran, that would be the leverage used for a ceasefire in Gaza,” she said.

“But instead, it sort of seems to be something like: If Netanyahu agrees to a ceasefire, then the US will facilitate this involuntary transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza.”

For her part, Okail likened pushing people to leave Gaza under the threat of bombardment and starvation to shoving Palestinians out of the enclave at gunpoint.

“If expanding the occupation and ethnic cleansing is their approach to ceasefire, it means they want to kill any ceasefire attempt, not negotiate one,” she told Al Jazeera."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-don-t-let-old-030001808.html,2025-07-10 04:30:00,Opinion: Don’t let old diseases regain strength,"Most of today’s generation of Americans didn’t live through the horrors of communicable childhood diseases. If they had, perhaps those diseases wouldn’t be on the rise again.

To recount what once was common knowledge, in the decade leading up to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, an average of 503,282 cases and 432 deaths were reported each year, while 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 developed a swelling of the brain known as encephalitis, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

In 1934, 265,269 cases of whooping cough were reported in the United States. About 9,000 deaths were reported annually until a vaccine was available in the 1940s, according to theNational Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

These were horrible and ever-present realities lurking in the shadows. Parents everywhere were grateful for immunizations that drastically lowered the risks of their children acquiring these diseases, as well as many others.

But today, many parents are opting their children out of these protections, and the diseases are re-emerging.

The nation is in the middle of a measles outbreak that, as of the time of this writing, has resulted in1,277 confirmed casesacross 38 states and the District of Columbia. In Utah,nine caseswere detected as of Monday. Nationwide, this is theworst outbreak since 1992.

The Community Vaccine Forum, a group consisting of Utah medical, pediatric and health organizations, released a report this month on how declining vaccination rates in Utah are impacting children entering schools.

The report says those rates for new kindergarteners in Utah have dropped from about 98% in the 2009-2010 school year to 89% in 2023-2024.

“Six out of 10 Utah schools are below the CDC measles target of 95% for adequate community protection,” it said. “Four out of 10 are below 90% and are likely to experience an outbreak if an infected child enters the school.”

In a recent meeting with the Deseret News/KSL editorial board, forum members said those figures are approximately the same for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP), polio and chickenpox immunizations.

TheCDC reports 8,485 casesof whooping cough in the United States so far in 2025. The disease is most deadly for infants and young children.The Associated Press reportsthat two babies in Louisiana and one 5-year-old child in Washington state have died this year.

These outbreaks correlate with a decline in kindergarten vaccinations nationwide. The forum’s report said 98.3% of Utah kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in the 2005-06 school year. By 2023-24, it had dropped to 88.8%. That took Utah from among the highest states for vaccination to among the lowest.

“When measles vaccination levels for a school fall to 90%, the chance of a community outbreak following the arrival of a child with measles rises to 51%,” the report said. “As vaccination levels continue to decline, the likelihood of an outbreak increases sharply.”

Utah students must be vaccinated before being enrolled in schools. But there are exemptions, and Utah has seen a growing number of parents seeking these. Many of these are granted for religious reasons. Utah does not require any documentation regarding church affiliation in order to receive such an exemption. Officials said these have gone from 0.7% of requests in the 2017-18 school year to 12.5% last year.

The report said “personal” reasons make up 84.6%, or the largest share of exemptions in Utah. Exemptions also are granted for medical reasons, which made up 2.9% during the last school year. Some exemptions certainly must be maintained, to allow parents to make informed decisions. But the trend is troubling.

Medical officials blame misinformation and a growing sense of distrust in institutions, including the medical establishment, for these declines. Many still believe in discredited reports linking vaccines with autism, while others mistakenly conflate time-honored and tested childhood immunizations with more recent Covid-19 immunizations which entered the realm of partisan politics. A state survey of those seeking exemptions found the largest percentage was concerned about vaccination safety.

The truth is vaccinations are subject to constant testing for safety.

AsHealthychildren.orgreports, hundreds of large-scale studies worldwide over several decades show that recommended vaccinations are safe and do not cause diabetes, infertility, autism or developmental delay.

What is clear, however, is that the failure to immunize puts entire communities at risk for deadly diseases that once used to plague parents and children everywhere.

The CDC reports that 92% of this year’s cases involve people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is not known.

The Washington Post reportsthat “at least 155 people have been hospitalized and three people have died of measles-related complications this year. The dead include two otherwise healthy children in Texas and a man in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated.”

Americans cannot afford, through negligence, to allow these long-controlled diseases to rear up and begin attacking again."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-cases-u-hit-1-032458113.html,2025-07-10 04:45:00,"Measles cases In U.S. hit 1,288, highest since disease eliminated in 2000","July 9 (UPI) --The number of reported measles cases in the United States has hit 1,288 in the first six months of this year, the most since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000, according data released Wednesday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The figure has surpassed the total number of infections in 2019, which was 1,274,the CDC said.

In 1992, there were 2,126 cases, eight years before the virus wasofficially declared eliminated in the United States in 2000after vaccine use became prevalent. That means measles was no longer spreading within the country, and new cases were only found when someone contracted measles abroad and returned to the United States.

Cases have been reported in 38 states, with 753 in Texas, where outbreaks were first reported in January. The next highest states are 95 in New Mexico and 87 in Kansas.

There have been 27 separate outbreaks, with 88% of confirmed cases related to them, the CDC said.

Of the cases, 29% are among children under 5, with 36% from those 5-19 years old and 34% of those 20 years and older.

Also, 92% of cases are among those unvaccinated, with 4% getting one measles, mumps and rubella dose, and 4% two.

Thirteen percent of those with measles were hospitalized, and there have been three deaths.

Despite the outbreaks, CDC said in the statement toCBS Newsthe risk of measles infection remains lower than in other countries, including Canada, Britain, France, Spain and Italy.

Canada, which has 12% of the U.S. population,has reported3,393 confirmed cases, including 2,231 in the province of Ontario.

""Measles risk is higher in U.S. communities with low vaccination rates in areas with active measles outbreaks or with close social and/or geographic linkages to areas with active measles outbreaks,"" the statement said, adding, ""CDC continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles.""

Astudy published in Junefound that the vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in 2023-2024.

Herd immunity is considered with a 95% vaccination rate.

The outbreak was originally reported in a rural Mennonite community with a low vaccination rate.

Measles, which is the most contagious infectious disease known to humans, spreads through the air via respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing.

Symptoms include cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes, sore throat, fever and a red, blotchy skin rash. Over-the-counter fever reducers or vitamin A may alleviate symptoms.

Before the measles vaccine, nearly every child contracted measles by the time they were 15.

The CDCestimatesthat 3 million to 4 million people in the United States were sickened by measles every year before the vaccine. That included 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths each year.

The measles vaccine was first licensed for public use in 1963, according to theWorld Health Organization.

The first MMR vaccine was administered in 1971."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/armenia-azerbaijan-leaders-meet-peace-060740036.html,2025-07-10 07:45:00,"Armenia, Azerbaijan leaders meet for peace talks in UAE, no breakthrough","The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan have held peace talks in the United Arab Emirates after nearly four decades of conflict, but no hoped-for breakthrough has been announced.

The meeting in Abu Dhabi on Thursday between Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev came after the two countries finalised adraft peace dealin March.

There was no sign of any concrete progress in the final statement released separately by the two countries’ foreign ministries, which noted the two leaders “agreed to continue bilateral negotiations and confidence-building measures between the two countries”.

“It was confirmed that bilateral negotiations represent the most efficient format to address all issues concerning the normalisation process, and on this basis, it was agreed to continue such result-oriented dialogue” and the delimitation of the shared border, it added.

The South Caucasus countries have fought a series of wars since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan that had a mostly ethnic Armenian population at the time, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.

Peace talks began after Azerbaijan recaptured Nagorno-Karabakh in a lightning offensive in September 2023, prompting an exodus of almost all of the territory’s 100,000 Armenians, who fled to Armenia.

But the timeline for sealing a deal remains uncertain.

Ceasefire violations along the heavily militarised 1,000km (620-mile) shared border surged soon after the draft deal was announced although there have been no reported violations recently.

A key stumbling block to a deal remains as Azerbaijan demands Armenia change its constitution, which it says makes implicit claims to Azerbaijani territory.

Yerevan denies this, but Pashinyan has repeatedly stressed in recent months – most recently this week – that his country’s founding charter needs to be updated.

Azerbaijan also asked for a transport corridor through Armenia to link the bulk of its territory to Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave that borders Baku’s ally Turkiye.

Pashinyan and Aliyev’s last encounter was in May on the sidelines of the European Political Community summit in Tirana, Albania.

In June, Pashinyan made arare visitto Istanbul to hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a meeting Armenia described as a “historic” step towards regional peace.

This week, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed hope for a swift peace deal between the neighbours.

The outbreak of hostilities between the two countries in the late 1980s prompted mass expulsions of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim Azeris from Armenia and Armenians, who are majority Christian, from Azerbaijan."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/despite-research-wv-counties-refuse-100019328.html,2025-07-10 10:45:00,"Despite research, WV counties refuse to fund harm reduction with opioid funds","On June 6, 2025, Laura Jones goes through boxes of Easy Touch syringes to be distributed by Milan Puskar Health Right in Morgantown, West Virginia, which operates one of only three syringe exchange programs in West Virginia. (Photo by Ty McClung/West Virginia University)

On a warm summer day in late May, about 100 people are waiting for their turn to go inside theNeighborhood S.H.O.P., located in the annex of Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia.

Inside the S.H.O.P. — which stands for Showers Healthcare Outreach Program — they will find resources like naloxone, clothing, first-aid supplies, food, showers and people offering services from rental to legal assistance. Director Derek Hudson says the no-barrier organization aids almost 2,000 people a month.

“The whole goal is to have people come in, be heard and know that at least someone is trying to help them,” Hudson said.

The kind of help the S.H.O.P. provides, broadly speaking, is harm reduction.

“Harm reduction for us focuses on meeting people where they are and empowering them with the tools to help prevent negative health outcomes from substance use,” Hudson explained. “Harm reduction, simply put, saves lives.”

What they won’t find inside, however, is one of the most well-known forms of harm reduction: new syringes.

Syringe Service Programs are highly regulated in the state of West Virginia, and service providers say it makes it almost impossible to run one. But SSPs are associated with anapproximately 50% reduction in HIV and HCV incidence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also benefit communities and public safety by reducing needlestick injuries and overdose deaths.

Hudson’s S.H.O.P. has received about$80,000 in state opioid settlement fundsfrom the West Virginia First Foundation specifically to create a re-entry program that will house people who are coming out of incarceration. It’s a program that will reduce recidivism and homelessness in the community, Hudson says, but it is not considered a harm reduction program.

Programs that provide more typical harm reduction in the form ofpractical strategies that reduce the negative consequences of drug use— which can include anything from free naloxone to wound care — are not receiving any of the tens of millions of dollars coming into state, county and city level government coffers in West Virginia fromthe 2021 global opioid lawsuit settlement agreementso far, according to an analysis by students from West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media of Freedom of Information Act responses from 50 of the state’s 55 counties. And without those funds, many of the people working to provide these services worry that disease transmission and overdose death rateswill buck a national trendand rise in West Virginia once again.

The funds are the result of a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,more than 720,000 people died from an opioid overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2022. West Virginia saw its peak in 2022, when 1,335, or75 out of every 100,000 people,died of an overdose.

West Virginia will receive about$980 million in total from the settlement agreement,split into payments over 18 years, with larger payments coming up front.The West Virginia First Foundation—a nonprofit created by the state Legislature — will control the spending of 72.5% of the funds, local governments 24.5%, and the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office 3%. AMemorandum of Understandingdictates what the money can be spent on, ranging fromlaw enforcement,prevention education, treatment and recovery to harm reduction.

In 2023, more than$73.5 millionof those fundswere distributed to county officialsin the state’s 55 counties. An analysis of FOIA responses by journalism students at West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media lacks information for five counties, but of the 50 others, Logan County received the highest distribution at $3,983,631, and Jefferson County received the least at $62,773.

Kanawha County, where the state’s capital Charleston is located, received just more than $3.9 million, and, according to County Commissioner Lance Wheeler, is focusing on funding recovery options. But Wheeler says they are also considering funding harm reduction organizations as well.

“This is something I strongly support,” Wheeler said. “We’re going to continue to do that, helping those who have a track record of success and those who are helping people who are struggling.”

Harm reduction has a long, complicated history in Kanawha County and Charleston. With a population of 47,000, Charleston is the largest city in the state. It also had thehighest overdose rate per capita in the entire country in 2022.

The city health department started a syringe service program in 2015, but was open for just three years before public and political pressure forced the city to shut it down. Then-mayor Danny Jones, a Republican, called the program a“mini-mall for junkies and drug dealers.”

The program’s closure in 2018, however, had dire consequences for public health.HIV and hepatitis rates skyrocketed, eventually requiring CDC officials to travel to Charleston in 2021 to help the city contain the outbreak.

Then-CDC HIV Prevention Chief Dr. Demetre Daskalakiscalled the outbreak“the most concerning HIV outbreak in the United States.”

Iris Sidikman, the harm reduction coordinator at the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, said the reluctance to fund harm-reduction services has directly impacted organizations that go beyond providing syringe services.

“When you have a tool to give someone in a non-judgmental space, it can open a world of possibilities,” Sidikman said.

In 2024, the Women’s Health Center applied to the Kanawha County Commissionfor $250,000 inopioid settlement funds twice, first through an online application and again at a public commission meeting. The clinic intended to use some the funds to provide increased naloxone training and education, cover costs related to screening and treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C and to fund a portion of clinical and programmatic staff salaries for the Harm Reduction Program, Sidikman said. Their application was denied without explanation.

The Women’s Health Center also applied with Charleston City Council in August 2023 to create a syringe service program on Charleston’s West Side, but was denied due to fear of an “increase in drug use and crime.”

Research on harm reduction by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrationhas shown that these practices reduce disease transmission and overdose rates, and experts believe politicians should look at the numbers more often.

“What we want to do with data analysis… is to be able to produce the evidence to show to political power that these interventions are working and capable, they are saving many lives,” said RTI International Research and Public Health Analyst Barrett Montgomery.

SOAR WV, another grassroots, Charleston-based harm reduction group, works to promote the health, dignity and voices of individuals who are impacted by substance use disorders, according to itswebsite. SOAR and other organizations picked up the task of providing new syringes until the state Legislature passedSenate Bill 334in 2021, which included strict regulations for running a syringe service program, such as requiring a West Virginia state ID in order to participate.

The city of Charleston also passed stipulations requiring that each syringe be uniquely labeled for tracking purposes.

As of June 2025, West Virginia Health Right operates the only syringe-service program in Charleston, but according to one source, “doesn’t even begin to make a dent in the problem.”

The political appetite is lacking because of a lack of information around the subject, says Dr. Susan Margaret Murphy, president of the Drug Intervention Institute in Charleston.

“Unfortunately, we are in a political climate where I don’t think research and scientific knowledge necessarily pleads the case. So sometimes it’s got to be kind of a heart-on-the-sleeve storytelling type of approach,” she said.

In neighboring Boone County, Commissioner Brett Kuhn agreed.

The county currently does not have any harm reduction services, and, so far, its three elected commissioners have not spent any of their $2.9 million in opioid settlement funds to provide them.

“I think in a rural setting, you’re going to see more pushback than you would in more of an urban setting,” Kuhn said. “I think with the syringes, it’s like people think we’re subsidizing the drug use, whereas with naloxone the attitude is more like, ‘well, we’re trying to help somebody that’s in trouble.’ And really, if you look at it, in both cases, is there any real difference between the two?”

Kuhn says that informing the public about how harm reduction works and its benefits to the community is key to fighting pushback.

“You’ve got to get out ahead of the curve. You’ve got to get out there and get the information out,” Kuhn said. “I sometimes think we don’t do a good enough job of that.”

Kuhn said his county experienced the brunt of the nation’s opioid overdose epidemic firsthand. Its opioid mortality rate in 2023 was 82.0 per 100,000, the second-highest rate in West Virginia,according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources.

Instead of harm reduction programs, the county spent its funds onpaying off its regional jail bill, supporting a food pantry, a county arrest record-keeping system, a rapid response vehicle for EMTs, and a 25-bed expansion at Hero House, a faith-based sober living home in Madison.

Kuhn and officials in other counties say the vague nature of the state’s MOU overviewing how the money can be spent puts the duty of interpretation on local officials. The county did not hold special community meetings or town halls to gather input on how to spend the funds.

But Kuhn says it’s rebuilding a sense of community that could help garner support for harm reduction services.

“I think it’s sometimes the attitude is ‘well, those people don’t want to help themselves,’” Kuhn said, “[but] if they don’t want to help themselves, then what do I need to do to try to help? And I think in a certain sense, we’ve lost that sense of community, that we’re all in this together.”

Kuhn hopes that can change in the future.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-sues-california-over-094541132.html,2025-07-10 11:00:00,"Trump administration sues California over egg prices, blames red tape","The US government sued California over its regulation of eggs and chickens, claiming that ""unnecessary red tape” provoked an egg price spike across the country.

“The laws and regulations challenged by the complaint impose costly requirements on farmers that have the effect of raising egg prices for American consumers by prohibiting farmers across the country from using commonly accepted agricultural methods that helped keep eggs affordable,” said a statement from the Department of Justice.

The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles, targeted three pieces of legislation: AB 1437, Proposition 2 and Proposition 12.

It argued that nationwide egg regulation is the responsibility of the federal government, rather than states, to allow for “national uniformity”. California can regulate farms within the state, but it cannot impose requirements on eggs from other states that are sold in California, said the lawsuit.

The disputed laws impose a number of requirements related to food safety and animal welfare. For example, Proposition 2 prevents farmers from confining a chicken to the extent where it is unable to ""lie down, stand up, fully extend its limbs, and turn around freely”.

This is not the first time that California’s egg regulations have sparked legal challenges. Six states sued California in 2014, although the plaintiffs lost the case in both a federal district court and a court of appeals.

In March this year, the US Department of Justice also launched an investigation to determine whether egg producers were price fixing during the bird flu outbreak.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/starmer-pushed-miliband-rare-good-130000984.html,2025-07-10 14:30:00,Starmer has pushed Miliband to make a rare good decision,"Ed Miliband is not known for sound decisions. He’s the architect of the“Clean Power 2030” pledge, a policy so outlandish it makes unicorn farming look like a solid industrial strategy. So, it comes as something of a surprise that he has quietly dropped a major redesign of the British electricity market known as “zonal pricing”.

The Energy Secretary made the decision under pressure from Sir Keir Starmer, who requested afurther reviewof the costs and benefits of a zonal system. But regardless of the genesis, it is a good decision nonetheless.

At present, Britain’s wholesale electricity market does not vary prices by location. While there are many different prices in the market – from half-hourly settlement periods to year-ahead contracts – they all assume a single geographic price zone.

Whether you’re in Kinross, Cornwall or Kent, the underlying market price is the same. Any cost differences in getting electricity to where it’s needed are sorted out later, mostly behind the scenes, through the grid operator’s intervention. The cost is added to bills.

Under a zonal model, the country would have been divided into regions based on electricity infrastructure so that bottlenecks in the grid become something market participants have to deal with through trading, rather than being resolved centrally by the system operator.Several electricity markets around the world operate on this basis, and the theory is that zonal pricing lowers costs by encouraging energy generation and demand to co-locate.

In principle, this sounds efficient. Generators and large energy users would have price signals that reflect physical grid constraints. Someone setting up a factory would look at regions where energy is cheapest, meaning less cabling would be needed to transport it.

In practice, it means businesses and households could face wildly different prices for reasons they can’t control – essentially paying for failures in grid investment.

Proponents argue that zones with large amounts of renewable energy, such as the north of Scotland, would attract businesses looking for cheap electricity.

Opponents use emotive language about“postcode lotteries”but also point out that the evidence base for co-location is weak and that it is essentially the tail wagging the dog: the economy must orient itself around the needs of the electricity grid, rather than the grid being built out to meet the needs of consumers.

This idea that consumers should serve the grid is increasingly popular among electricity planners. Both the National Energy System Operator (NESO) and, to some extent, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) support demand flexibility, the notion that households will charge electric cars or run washing machines in the middle of the night when power is cheap, rather than when it suits them.

But Miliband’s real reason for shelving zonal pricing is more likely personal – the threat it poses to his cherished “Clean Power 2030” dream. This delusional plan calls for Britain to use unabated gas generation only around 5pc of the time by 2030, a transformation requiring eye-watering amounts of new investment in both grid infrastructure and new wind and solar generation.

Skittish investors typically do not welcome radical market redesigns. Slicing the market intoregional zones would almost certainly freeze investmentuntil the new rules were nailed down, which could easily take until the next election.

So in a strange twist, Miliband may be doing the right thing, just for all the wrong reasons. He probably isn’t abandoning zonal pricing because it would impose unfair costs on households or because it prioritises grid theory over economic reality. He’s likely rejecting it to protect a different unworkable policy.

Still, whatever his motive, this is a rare outbreak of good judgment. Even a broken clock is right twice a day: this may be Miliband’s moment.

Kennedy Jr. was confirmed because one senator decided to believe his lies.

During an exclusive interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper Wednesday, Tillis responded to the claim that Kennedy had gone back on his promises to Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

“The main reason I supported Kennedy was because Bill Cassidy thought that we should see how it plays out,” Tillissaid.

But Cassidy, who had led the charge on Kennedy’s confirmation, had been duped.

In February, Cassidy hadpromisedbefore the Senate that, if confirmed, Kennedy would “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations without changes.”

But in early June, Kennedy stripped that committee of all of its members.

In apost on XMonday, Cassidy explained that “now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.

Cassidy alsoclaimedthat Kennedy had “committed that he would work within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems,” and that he would not use his position to “wrongfully sow public fear” about vaccines.

In May, Kennedyannouncedthat he’d made changes to the CDC’s recommended vaccine schedules without ACIP’s input, upending the decades-old consensus-driven method for making recommendations. Kennedy has also repeatedly sown doubts about vaccines, toutingconspiracy theoriesandpossible health risksfor the measles vaccine amid a massive measles outbreak."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/oldest-known-dog-breed-reveals-180000812.html,2025-07-10 19:15:00,Oldest known dog breed reveals hidden human history,"TheIditarodis the longest annual sled dog race– covering over 1,500 miles across Alaska. But there’s another impressive, long-distance sled dog journey worth considering: their slow motionrace through time. A close look intocanine geneticsreveals sled dogs have been around and on the move for thousands of years. Specifically, the Greenland sled dog–calledQimmeq(singular), orQimmit(plural) in Greenlandic–has a history traceableall the way back 9,500 yearsto Zhokhov Island in Eastern Siberia. And they’ve been a distinct, isolated group for about 1,000 years of that time. They are among the oldest (andpossiblytheoldest) dog breed on Earth.

In a new studypublished July 10in the journalScience,paleogeneticists mapped the path of these culturally important canines from their ancient origin up to the present day. The findings reveal new insights into Greenland sled dogs’ spread and movement over millennia and also the accompanying human history. The research could prove critical to preserving healthy sled dog populations far into the future.

Throughout their long history,Qimmithave remained working dogs–still almost exclusively bred by mushers to pull sleds for transportation and to assist in hunts,Tatiana Feuerborn, lead study author and a paleogeneticist at the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes for Health, tellsPopular Science.

“They’re a working dog that has been performing the same task with the same people for 1,000 years or more. That’s what sets them apart from other Arctic and sled dog breeds,” Feuerborn adds.

Alaskan huskies and malamutes, by comparison, aremore intermixed with other types of dogs. And, now that these once-Arctic dogs are frequently bred as companion animals, rather than sled pullers, they’re the byproducts of a different type of selection.

Feuerborn and her co-authors dug into that distinctive history and sequenced 92 whole dog genomes, spanning from ancient times to the present day. Older samples came from museums, from bones collected at archaeological sites or fur preserved in traditional Inuit clothing. The 63 contemporaryQimmitgenomes were provided by Greenlandic mushers who took cheek swaps and saliva from their own pups.

The research team separated the DNA into three major groupings: pre-contact between the Inuit and Europeans, post-contact until 1998, and then post-1998 to present-day samples. Next,  they compared the genome groupings to each other. They also contrasted their dataset with three other major sources: previously analyzed DNA from ancient samples like theSiberian Zhokhov dogand a 3,700-year-old dog from Teshepuk Lake in Alaska, other modern dogs from around the world, and outgroups like wolves and black-backed jackals.

They found thatQimmeqgenetics have remained remarkably consistent over time, going back to the earliest known sled dogs. From their Siberian origin point nearly 10,000 years ago, the scientists were able to traceQimmeqmovement with people across the Arctic ice into Alaska, then across the Canadian Arctic to the northwest of Greenland. Because of how similarQimmitgenomes are to Alaskan and Canadian dogs from thousands of years prior, the researchers infer that Inuit spread across the North American Arctic unfolded rapidly–in as little as one to two centuries–before the Greenland sled dogs became relatively isolated.

Based on sled dog genetic markers, Feuerborn and her colleagues suggest the Inuit arrived in Greenland between 800 and 1,200 years ago. These dates are a few centuries earlier than most estimates, suggesting the Inuit got to Greenland sooner than previously thought, she says.

“We’re not the first people to say this… but this is some of the first quantifiable evidence that really lends credence to it,” she notes.

[ Related:Walrus DNA suggests meetings between Vikings and Indigenous Inuit. ]

In the scope of archaeological time, a century or two may not seem like much, but it could shift the narrative around whether the Inuit or the Norse Vikings made their way to the land mass first, she notes. “There’s been this debate back and forth…so now this might push a little more towards the earlier arrival of the Inuit into the North,” she says

The researchers then looked at various populations ofQimmitliving in Greenland. They found the oldest dog genomes split cleanly into four groups: northern, western, eastern, and northeastern populations. The finding mirrors human DNA results and supports the idea that, since the peopling of Greenland, different Inuit groups had limited amounts of mixing, instead staying largely in their distinct regions and settlements.

The direction of human development in Greenland has long been a question, with competing counterclockwise and clockwise theories. TracingQimmeqgenetics indicates that both sides of the discussion have credence. Inuit movement in Greenland seems to have branched in both directions from the initial, northern settlement point, in two waves, per the study.

The northeastern findings are especially notable because they confirm the existence of a pre-European-contact human community in that region. Previously, this group was only indicated by scant archaeological findings and they died out without leaving a clear historical record. The level of canine inbreeding, drops in genetic diversity, and estimated dog population size over time there, indicates that people in the area likely struggled with famine and couldn’t maintain robust sled dog numbers, according to  Feuerborn. Elsewhere, known historical events like well-documented famines, a canine distemper outbreak, and a rabies outbreak are also clearly reflected in the dog DNA.

[ Related:Meet the former musher investigating sled dog genetics. ]

One surprise came in the analyses of wolf gene markers withinQimmit.Surprisingly, despite many historical records of Greenlanders purposefully outbreeding their sled dogs with local wolves to boost pack health, there was little evidence thatQimmitare more closely linked to wolves than any other sled dog groups.

“We know in the recent era that these hybridization events have occurred,” Feuerborn says, so “we were shocked” by the results.

It’s possible that, despite these purposeful outbreeding events, wolf genes don’t persist in the sled dog population because they’re not all that beneficial after all.Qimmitare under very strong selection to be good team players, willing to work with humans, strong endurance athletes, cold-tolerant, and to be able to subsist off a very specific all-meat and blubber diet. If they fail on any one count, they won’t survive over the long term, she explains. “If a wolf-dog hybrid can’t perform well, they’re not going to be maintained in the population.”

But another possibility is that they just didn’t have enough samples to parse out wolf influence in the sled dogs’ genes. In any paleogenetic research, there’s always the chance of inadvertent bias or missed connections because the sample pool is necessarily small. “More samples from the regions of interest would potentially give us a different or a more nuanced answer,” notes Feuerborn.

In total though, the research is an illuminating glimpse intoQimmeqhistory and important information for the dogs’ future conservation. Modern technologies, lifestyle changes, and climate change have led toQimmitpopulation declines. In 2002, there wereabout 25,000 in Greenland. As of 2020, therewere around 13,000. However, sled dogs retain an important cultural place in Greenlandic society, as living markers of heritage and history– as well as a critical practical role.

Greenland’s geology means that settlements around the landmass are still separated by vast, roadless expanses of land. In most cases, snowmobile or dog sled are the only means of overland travel between the various coastal enclaves. “Unlike a snowmobile, sled dogs aren’t going to break down and they’re not going to run out of gas,” Feuerborn says. “They definitely are the optimum resource,” for transportation and for hunting, she notes. After all, snowmobiles can’t smell seals or polar bears, nor travel quietly enough to avoid scaring off potential prey.

Preserving a healthyQimmeqpopulation requires an understanding of their current status, how much inbreeding is occurring, and what the minimum necessary numbers are for avoiding the spread of deleterious mutations. And so, despite declines, all signs seem positive. “They’re actually really healthy dogs,” says Feuerborn. She hopes her work helps them stay that way.

“Of course, conservation normally focuses on wild species,” she notes. “But dogs have been so intrinsically tied to human history as the first domesticated animal. They have been at the formation of every human society. In Greenland in particular, these dogs have been there all along. Being able to preserve that cultural history alongside the genetic history is important. It has immense cultural value.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-sues-california-over-172522329.html,2025-07-10 20:00:00,Trump administration sues California over cost of eggs,"The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging that three state laws are the reason behind rising egg prices in the Golden State.

“The State of California has contributed to the historic rise in egg prices by imposing unnecessary red tape on the production of eggs. Through a combination of voter initiatives, legislative enactments, and regulations, California has effectively prevented farmers across the country from using a number of agricultural production methods which were in widespread use—and which helped keep eggs affordable,”the lawsuit said.

The suit targets three state laws, AB 1437, Proposition 2, and Proposition 12.

Prop 2, a statewide ballot measure voters passed in 2008, created welfare mandates for farm animals such as egg-laying hens, andAB 1437regulates egg quality for human consumption. The administration argues that the laws work in tandem to depress egg production and drive up prices.

The suit also calls outProp. 12,passed by voters in 2018, which requires specific minimum-space requirements for chickens and other farm animals.

The administration also argues that regulating egg production falls under the federal government’s domain, citing a 1970 federal law.

There was no mention of the bird flu. An outbreak of the disease earlier this yearhiked prices up nationwide.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s press office poked fun at the suit with apost on X,claiming President Donald Trump is “back to his favorite hobby: blaming California for literally everything.”

“Next up: @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom caused the fall of Rome and sent the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs,” the post continued.

Others eat turkey on a more regular basis, taking advantage of the fact that turkey is one of the healthiest meat options out there. However and whenever you like to eat your turkey, though, take caution: Raw turkey can harbor some dangerous bacteria, such as salmonella, clostridium perfringens, and campylobacter, all of which can make you pretty ill.

Luckily, when it's discovered that bacteria like these have made their way into the food chain, turkey brands often issue recalls — but it's not just bacteria that's to blame for the myriad turkey recalls that have impacted millions of people throughout the United States over the last two decades. Other culprits include listeria, foreign objects mixed in with ground meat, and more. Here's what you need to know.

When you think of jerky and similar meat sticks, you probably automatically assume that they're always going to be safe to eat. You don't have to worry about these products like you might raw, refrigerated, or frozen meat. They're preserved and ready to go, and can last in the pantry for an impressively long time.

However, an unexpected safety hazard prompted the Chomps brand to recall 30,000 pounds of its meat sticks, including its Original Turkey Sticks, in 2025. Two customers reported to the company that they'd found pieces of metal in their turkey sticks — and that's definitely something you don't want to chomp down on when you're snacking away.

Metal is frequently found in food products. When this occurs, it's called metal contamination, and it's one of themost popular reasons that food is recalled, alongside other, similar issues such as plastic contamination.

Sometimes, foods are recalled not due to a clear-cut safety hazard, but instead due to an issue that's seemingly more benign: misbranding. Misbranding is when a producer puts the wrong label on a food item, or an incorrect label on a food item. In a June 2025 recall, Gaiser's European Style Provisions, Inc., recalled more than 140,000 pounds of ready-to-eat bologna, including turkey bologna (yes, bologna can be made from all sorts of meats, including turkey, chicken, pork, and veal), because of this issue.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the labels on the bologna did not include necessary information regarding ""meat or poultry source materials."" However, it could have been difficult for consumers to know whether or not they had purchased or consumed the affected bolognas in this instance, as some of it was sold in delis at retail stores, where the bologna would have been sliced and wrapped for the customer to take home in a nondescript, unlabeled pack. Luckily, the FSIS gave the recall its lowest safety risk ranking for recalls, a Class III ranking, which means the organization does not expect the recalled product to cause anyone any serious health problems.

If you've read up on other major recalls from 2024, such asmajor recalls for ready-to-eat meatsormajor frozen food recalls, you may have come across the BrucePac listeria outbreak. In the latter half of 2024, BrucePac, a producer of various meat products that are then distributed to a variety of brands for use in other products, recalled nearly 12 million pounds of food due to concerns over listeria. More than 75 products were impacted, including a Marketside turkey cobb salad sold at Walmart and turkey club wrap sold at Trader Joe's.

The recall occurred after one of the affected products tested positive for listeria, but BrucePac reported at the time of recall that no actual illnesses had been associated with the recall. That's good news, considering that a listeria infection is one nasty experience. While a mild case of infection causes gastrointestinal distress, more severe cases can cause issues like seizures or even fatalities, and pregnant individuals are most at risk for severe cases.

In the span of just a few months, Salm Partners, which produces sausages and hot dogs for a handful of brands, issued recalls for not one, but two brands of turkey kielbasa, both due to foreign matter being found within the sausages. In the first instance, in January 2024, the manufacturer recalled Parkview turkey kielbasa, because consumers began complaining that they were finding bone fragments in the kielbasa. In fact, one consumer even reported that they injured their mouth on the bone fragments.

While bone fragments are at least somewhat understandable in a processed meat product, it's less forgivable to find pieces of rubber in your turkey kielbasa. That, though, was exactly what prompted Salm Partners to recall more than 35,000 pounds of Johnsonville turkey kielbasa in March 2024. Again, it was consumers who had to bring the issue to light, but in this case, at least no one reported being harmed by finding the rubber where it didn't belong.

The U.S. government requires that manufacturers list common food allergens on their product packaging, if that allergen is found within the product. The common-sense rule just keeps everyone safe. As such, when it's discovered that a product does contain an allergen, but the packaging doesn't list it, a recall is required.

This was almost the case in 2023, when Pruski's Market turkey jerky was recalled for containing soy. However, a true recall was not issued as, by the time the problem was discovered, the product was no longer available for purchase. As such, the FSIS issued a public health alert instead, informing the public of the potential health risk that could come with eating the jerky. A public health alert is issued any time the FSIS recognizes such a risk, but cannot issue a formal recall just yet.

If you don't think that soy is that big of a deal, and really isn't a ""risk,"" consider that approximately three out of 1,000 adults are allergic to soy and about 0.4% of children are allergic to soy. An allergic reaction can range from esophageal inflammation to anaphylaxis.

Some recalls are issued because not only does the packaging fail to declare all ingredients in the product, such as allergens, but because the product found within the packaging isn't at all what the packaging exterior promised. Imagine your surprise when you think you purchased a box of turkey sausage, but you open up the box and find turkey meatballs instead. That was the case for some consumers in April 2023, prompting the recall of nearly 12,000 pounds of Jennie-O frozen turkey meatballs. In this case, the product had been distributed to hotels, restaurants, and institutions.

While some would simply open up the box, see what awaited inside, and adjust their dinner plans, this inadvertent switch posed a threat more serious than just a minor inconvenience to some. The meatballs contain soy, a major, popular allergen, and one that can cause fatal allergic reactions in severe cases.

In 2022, several brands of turkey wraps, including Rachael's Food Corporation and Atlantis Fresh Market wraps, tested positive for listeria. More than 2,200 pounds of the wraps were then recalled from retail locations throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York.

Deli meats are very often recalled, as are products like these that contain deli meats, formultiple reasons— but the primary culprit is typically listeria. Deli meats provide listeria with a prime breeding ground, as the bacteria loves a moist home and it can be easily transmitted from a listeria-carrying animal to the final product. Additionally, listeria survives cold temperatures and other preservation methods that may kill similar foodborne illness-causing bacteria. It's suspected that listeria outbreaks are on the rise, too, even though infection is still technically considered rare, with about 1,600 people falling ill with the bacteria in the United States annually. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends pregnant individuals, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems avoid eating unheated deli meat, like turkey, entirely.

Butterball and turkey go hand in hand. It's the brand that many think of when imagining their Thanksgiving bird. Despite being a household name brand, Butterball is not immune to the occasional recall. In 2021, Butterball recalled more than 14,000 pounds of ground turkey after shoppers began to complain that they were finding pieces of blue plastic mixed into the ground poultry. The same recall impacted ground turkey sold under the Kroger store brand. Unfortunately, through the recall, only about 2,500 pounds of turkey was actually recovered, meaning about 13,500 pounds of the plastic-contaminated turkey was still being eaten, unless consumers tossed their turkey in the trash.

Luckily for Butterball (and Butterball fans), the brand was able to avoid any further recalls for the next few years following this incident. However, the brand was not able to avoid rumors of recalls. In 2024, rumors swirled that Butterball turkeys would be recalled, following the release of videos of alleged animal abuse within Butterball facilities; however, no recall actually occurred.

In 2021, the FSIS issued another turkey-related public health alert instead of a recall. The product in question was no longer available for purchase at the time of the alert, but the ground turkey at the center of concern still posed a potential threat to public safety. From December 2020 and into March 2021, the FSIS and the CDC teamed up to investigate a multistate outbreak of salmonella poisoning. There were nearly 30 reported cases of illness across 12 states, and the organizations' findings turned up a packet of ground turkey that tested positive for salmonella.

The public health alert issued as a result applied to more than 200,000 pounds of raw ground turkey produced by Plainville Brands, LLC, including turkey sold under the Nature's Promise, Plainville Farms, and Wegmans store brands. The good news? You can kill salmonella if you cook foods to a temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

During a busy workday or after a stressful commute, sometimes you just want to reach for a convenient, microwavable meal for a quick bite to eat. What you don't want to find in that quick bite? Rocks. Unfortunately, if you purchased one of several variants of Healthy Choice Power Bowls in 2020, you could've found small rocks scattered throughout your lunch.

In May of that year, Conagra Brands recalled nearly 300,000 pounds of Healthy Choice meals, including Turkey Sausage & Egg White Scramble bowls, that had been shipped out all over the United States and Canada, as customers began complaining they were finding small rocks in their food. How exactlywould a rock get into a microwavable meal? In some cases, rocks wind up in food because they're picked up during the harvesting of an ingredient (like produce), and they're just never properly removed.

While the 2021 Butterball recall was the most recent for the brand, it wasn't Butterball's first recall. Just two years earlier, in 2019, Butterball recalled ground turkey sold both under its own brand and under store brands at Kroger and Food Lion, due to suspected salmonella contamination. The recall impacted nearly 80,000 pounds of ground poultry.

The recall came after the FSIS and CDC began investigating a salmonella outbreak impacting five patients from two different states. Sound like five people is just too few for an actual ""outbreak?"" The CDC defines an outbreak as any event in which at least just two people contract an illness from the same contaminant. As you could imagine then, outbreaks, while sounding serious, are actually pretty common. In fact, salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness, with more than a million Americans contracting it annually. Of these million Americans, about 26,500 are hospitalized per year, while approximately 420 people die from salmonella each year.

Butterball isn't the only popular turkey brand to go through a salmonella-related recall. In 2018, Jennie-O also recalled a large amount of ground turkey — 164,210 pounds — following a salmonella outbreak.

This outbreak was particularly large, too. At the time of the recall, the FSIS noted the outbreak was reportedly impacting more than 200 patients across nearly 40 states. All of the patients reported eating various types of turkey, but that turkey came from various brands and various stores, meaning the outbreak couldn't be blamed on Jennie-O alone. Some patients also reported feeding their pets raw turkey pet food, while others reported working around or living with someone who works around turkeys. By the time of the CDC's final outbreak investigation report, the organization had connected 358 illnesses across 42 states, and 133 hospitalizations and one death, to the outbreak. The outbreak had also spread to Canada.

In 2017, another recall connected to metal contamination resulted in 38,475 pounds of Prestage Foods, Inc. ground turkey products being recalled across Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Sold under store brands at Weis and Publix, and under the Fit & Active brand, the turkey contained bits of metal shards.

Fortunately, in this case, it wasn't the consumers that were raising the red flag after finding metal in their meat. Instead, plant workers discovered something was wrong when they were cleaning equipment, and reported it to the FSIS. Then, shortly after, stores called in reporting that they saw the metal shards in the turkey packaging. The FSIS gave the recall a Class II risk ranking, meaning that the organization determined that there was a small possibility of an adverse health problem, if someone were to eat the turkey. Still, regardless of how small or large that possibility, no one wants to eat metal shavings.

A lot of times, the ""foreign matter"" found in recalled foods is relatively easy to identify. More often than not, the foreign matter is plastic or metal, but sometimes it's something a little odder, too (as was the case when McCain Foods had to recall bags of hash browns because people were finding bits of golf balls in them). However, occasionally, you just don't know what exactly the foreign matter is, only that it shouldn't be eaten.

One example of this was in 2016, when Michigan Turkey Producers recalled more than 54,000 pounds of turkey breasts (and recovered an impressive 51,215 pounds of the product) due to an unidentifiable black material. Was it plastic? Was it rubber? No one could be sure. The impacted products had been sent to food service providers in Florida and Puerto Rico, at which point a customer complained of finding the odd item in the cooked, whole, and sliced turkey breasts.

Yet another massive salmonella outbreak can be linked to turkey. In the fall of 2011, Cargill Meat Solutions, which produces turkey products under brands like Honeysuckle and Shady Brook Farms, recalled 36 million pounds of ground turkey in August and then another 185,000 pounds of ground turkey in September. The producer's ground turkey had been connected to patients who had fallen ill during the outbreak, and after the FSIS investigated the Cargill plant, it found that ground turkey samples therein tested positive for salmonella.

In this particular outbreak, more than 130 people fell ill over 34 states, over the course of seven months, with the outbreak finally ending after the September Cargill recall — indicating that perhaps Cargill's turkey had been making people sick for quite a while. One death was reported in the outbreak. Of the individuals that contributed data to the CDC and FSIS investigation into the outbreak, more than half confirmed eating ground turkey.

In 2006, a HoneyBaked Ham Co. recall earned the FSIS's highest danger ranking, garnering a Class I-level risk, which informs consumers that eating a recalled food will probably result in a serious health consequence or death. The recall impacted nearly 50,000 pounds of cooked ham and turkey (so think deli meat) that could have been contaminated with listeria. The ham and turkey had been sold throughout Ohio, as well as to customers who placed orders via phone or online. HoneyBaked discovered the contamination after its products underwent microbiological testing.

Luckily for HoneyBaked, this recall wasn't nearly as large as some of the others that have impacted deli meat like ham and turkey over the years. For example, in late 2024, Perdue Premium Meat recalled more than 2 million pounds of ham and pepperoni due to listeria. Ham was also part of the widely publicized and massive Boar's Head recall that occurred in 2024, and which was associated with nearly 60 hospitalizations and at least nine deaths.

“California has contributed to the historic rise in egg prices by imposing unnecessary red tape on the production of eggs,” wrote lawyersin the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsomand Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta vowed to defend the state law.

""Pointing fingers won't change the fact that it is the President's economic policies that have been destructive. We'll see him in court,"" Bonta said in a statement.

California's animal-welfare law was approved by voters as Proposition 12 in 2018. The law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023.

“In a functioning democracy, policy choices like these usually belong to the people and their elected representatives,” wrote Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, a Trump appointee,in the lead opinion. He said that while many state laws may have economic effects in other states, they are only in violation of the Constitution if they were written with the intent to interfere with interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice contends that the California law preempts federal laws, including the Egg Products Inspection Act, and that no state has the right to institute its own standards on the production or “quality, condition, weight, quantity or grade” of eggs that differ from those set by the federal government.

The law has been repeatedly challenged by the National Pork Producers Council and others. Just last month, the Supreme Court declined to accept a petition for certiorari from the Iowa Pork Producers Assn.

In the suit filed Wednesday, the Justice Department contends that California’s egg standards ""do not advance consumer welfare"" and are ""not based in specific peer-reviewed published scientific literature or accepted as standards within the scientific community to reduce human food-borne illness ... or other human or safety concerns.”

Egg pricessoared earlier this year, soon after Trump took office. Most experts pointed to the H5N1 bird flu epidemic as the cause of the spike, as millions of egg-laying chickens across the nation were euthanized to prevent the spread.

Prices have since moderated as the outbreak has diminished. In the last 30 days, there has been only one reported commercial flock infection in Pennsylvania. The birds were not egg layers.

In February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Secretary Brooke Rollins,penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that the Trump administration would target the law.

California egg producers have in the past opposed changing the law.

Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation, said in an interview in February that California egg farmers had spent millions of dollars to upgrade and adapt their farms. Reversing the law would put California poultry farmers — and all the other egg producers that sell to California — at a huge economic disadvantage by requiring them to invest millions more dollars to buy cages and re-adapt their facilities for such operations.

Animal welfare advocates say the lawsuit is short-sighted and has the potential to hurt California's egg-laying industry.

“With this ill-considered legal action, the Administration is dropping a set of stink bombs into the bosom of the egg industry,"" Wayne Pacelle, president of Animal Wellness Action and the Center for a Humane Economy, said in a statement..

He said California egg farmers are still recovering from the bird flu outbreak, and this suit, if successful, would disrupt the still-fragile supply chain ""and provide an opening for egg farmers from Mexico — which have no animal welfare standards at all — to access the California market.”

“The State of California has contributed to the historic rise in egg prices by imposing unnecessary red tape on the production of eggs. Through a combination of voter initiatives, legislative enactments, and regulations, California has effectively prevented farmers across the country from using a number of agricultural production methods which were in widespread use — and which helped keep eggs affordable,”the lawsuit said.

The suit targets three state laws, AB 1437, Proposition 2, and Proposition 12.

Prop 2, a statewide ballot measure voters passed in 2008, created welfare mandates for farm animals such as egg-laying hens, andAB 1437regulates egg quality for human consumption. The administration argues that the laws work in tandem to depress egg production and drive up prices.

The suit also calls outProp. 12,passed by voters in 2018, which requires specific minimum-space requirements for chickens and other farm animals.

The administration also argues that regulating egg production falls under the federal government’s domain, citing a 1970 federal law.

There was no mention of the bird flu. An outbreak of the disease earlier this yearhiked prices up nationwide.

The U.S. government is combating a potential invasion of flesh-eating New World screwworm maggots, which threaten livestock, wildlife, and humans, with projected losses topping $100 billion

A $29.5 million multi-agency plan includes breeding up to 200 million sterile male flies in facilities in Mexico and Panama to curb reproduction by releasing them along the Texas-Mexico border

The USDA and APHIS are also increasing border inspections, livestock monitoring, and preventive measures to keep the infestation from reaching the U.S. mainland

In news that seems straight out of a sci-fi movie, flesh-eating maggots are set to hatch in the lower U.S. soon. In response, the government has begun breeding billions of flies to prevent the potential infestation from spreading further north.

The New World screwworm fly larvae (Cochliomyia hominivorax) or NWS, commonly known as the ""man-eater"" maggots, could have a devastating and even fatal effect on U.S. livestock, the beef industry, wildlife, pets, and in some cases, humans.

On Thursday, July 10, theAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)released an announcement stating its partnership with multiple U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Department of State and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, to respond to the ongoing outbreak of NWS in Central America and Mexico.

If these parasitic maggots develop into adult NWS flies and move into the U.S., it could cost the States over $100 billion in cattle and beef losses. ""This can kill a 1,000-pound cow in two weeks,"" Dr. Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association, toldUSA Today. ""The federal government is being very aggressive in working to contain this.""

CDC

The plan to prevent the infestation from spreading into the U.S. was outlined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in apress release publishedon Monday, June 18.

In the release, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced the launch of the $8.5 million NWS fly dispersal facility in the Moore Air Base in Edinburg, Texas, aimed to “enhance USDA’s already robust ability to detect, control, and eliminate this pest.”

Thefive-pronged planto stop the spread of NSW flies also includes investing $21 million into a fly production facility in Metapa, Mexico, which is estimated to produce an additional 60 to 100 million sterile male NSW flies. The male NWS flies, sterilized with radiation, will then be released to mate with female flies, whose eggs won’t fertilize or hatch, and will, in turn, lead to the NWS flies dying out before they spread farther.

The flies being produced at the Mexico facility will join those being raised at the Panama-United States Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm (COPEG) facility in Panama, which produces approximately 100 million flies per week. The USDA anticipates that it will take 18 months for the first wave of flies to be fully prepared for release along the Texas-Mexico border.

The release noted that the USDA and APHIS plan to increase border inspections, livestock monitoring, and other preventive measures to keep the infestation from creeping into the U.S.

""We do not take lightly the threat NWS poses to our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain,"" said Secretary Rollins. ""The United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again.""

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)

The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a new measles case Thursday, more than a month since the last case was reported.

The new case is in Williams County involving a person who recently traveled out of state and was unvaccinated against the disease, said Mindy Michaels, a spokesperson for the department.

The state now has 35 confirmed measles cases, with the first one confirmed April 29 in Williams County in northwest North Dakota. Until this week, the state had not confirmed a case since May 28, according to the state’smeasles dashboard.

The latest case is unrelated to the previous cases and there is no evidence of community spread, saidJenny Galbraith, adult immunization manager for HHS.

The new case is the 17th reported in Williams County, the most in the state, followed by 10 cases in Grand Forks County, seven in Cass County and one case in Burke County. Two hospitalizations were reported.

All North Dakota cases have involved people who were unvaccinated.

Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Daphne Clark, spokesperson for the Upper Missouri District Health Unit in Williston, said people should still isolate themselves if they are feeling ill. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation followed by a bodywide rash, according to HHS.

A single incubation period for measles can be as long as 21 days from an initial exposure.

Vaccination remains the best protection against contracting measles, Clark said.

People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected.

The department said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing infection. The vaccine is recommended for children at 12-15 months and a booster between 4-6 years old.

Clark said the Upper Missouri District Health Unit will continue to operate its walk-in vaccine clinic for measles every Thursday. She added the foot traffic for the MMR vaccine has slowed since the outbreak was first reported, but people should also be thinking about getting their back-to-school immunizations.

“We start doing our messaging to remind people after the Fourth of July because what we don’t want is everybody trying to come in the couple days before school starts,” she said.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/dog-tests-positive-rabies-grant-030100299.html,2025-07-11 04:00:00,Dog tests positive for rabies in Grant County,"Jul. 10—A dog was euthanized after testing positive for rabies on Monday in Grant County.

It was the 11th case of rabies found in Grant County since 2020, New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson David Barre said in a release Thursday. The last time a dog contracted rabies in New Mexico was in 2023 in Bernalillo County, according to the NMDOH rabies website.

""This dog had not received any veterinarian-administered rabies vaccines,"" according to the news release. ""A rabies vaccine purchased over the counter had been administered.""

Rabies is a progressive neurologic disorder that affects the nervous system of the animal — causing a wide variety of symptoms including aggression, trouble with eating or drinking, and lethargy.

""It is always fatal,"" said Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH. ""There have been a couple rare documented cases of recovery in humans ... but it's not something that animals or people can be expected to recover from.""

The infected dog was euthanized and people who had been exposed to the dog were receiving rabies shots as a precautionary measure, according to the release. Dogs who made contact with the infected dog were given booster shots and will be monitored by NMDOH for 45 days.

Rabies is typically transferred through the saliva of an infected animal, most commonly through a bite, Phipps said.

NMDOH Scientific Laboratory Division tested the dog to confirm it had rabies.

While testing cannot determine how an animal gets rabies, the test will show what type of strain. In this case, the rabies was a fox strain variant, which indicates that a fox or another wild animal that had gotten the fox variant bit the dog.

Phipps is not concerned about a potential rabies outbreak, but she said it is important to have animals vaccinated.

""This incident serves as a reminder to residents that while rabies is relatively rare in our state, animals can contract the disease from local wildlife,"" Phipps said. ""Rabies is known to circulate in wildlife, especially foxes and bats, in southwestern New Mexico."""

The G7 countries immobilized roughly $300 billion inRussian sovereign assetsat the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, later funneling the windfall profits toUkraine's reconstruction and defense.

TheGermanchancellor, who met President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Italy, noted that Germany is helping Ukraine rebuild its economy also for its own reasons.

""Growth, market freedom, our energy security, as well as the extraordinary strain on our social systems caused by war refugees: all of this is linked to the war in Ukraine,""Merz said.

The chancellor further noted that Germany has been involved in Ukraine's reconstruction efforts since the outbreak of the full-scale war.

""The reconstruction of Ukraine is not just a matter of the future... Day after day, we are ensuring that life in Ukraine can continue despite all of Russia's daily and especially nightly attacks.""

The comments come as Russia continues to intensify strikes across Ukraine and ground offensives along the front line, damaging infrastructure and putting ever greater strain on the Ukrainian economy.

Delivering opening remarks at the conference on July 10,Zelensky urged European partnersto form a recovery coalition to help rebuild Ukraine, calling for an approach similar to the post-World War II Marshall Plan.

The Ukrainian president also called upon Western countries to use the immobilized Russian assets — not only their proceeds — more actively to help Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.

At the event, the EU unveilednew financingworth billions of euros, including theEuropeanFlagship Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called ""the largest equity fund globally to support (Ukraine's) reconstruction.""

According to public health officer in Putnam County, where the case was discovered, the risk to the public is low and there's no outbreak. But if you're concerned about you or your family getting the measles, it might be time to check your immunization records and talk to your doctor.

Here's what experts recommend for preventing measles.

Adam Amos, a public health officer in Putnam County, suggested checking immunization records to ensure that you've gotten the MMR vaccine.

""Most children receive two doses — one around age 1 and a second before kindergarten,"" he wrote in apost on the health department's website. ""Adults born after 1956 should ensure they've had two doses or confirmed immunity with a blood test.""

Amos called the MMR vaccine ""safe and extremely effective.""

Although the vaccine is recommended for most people,Centers for Disease Control and Preventionguidelines suggest checking with health care providers first before getting the MMR vaccine in the following cases:

If you've had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of MMR or MMRV vaccines, or if you have any life-threatening allergies.

If you are or may be pregnant.

If your immune system is weakened due to disease or medical treatment, or if you have a family history that includes immune system problems.

If you've ever had a condition that makes you bruise or bleed easily.

If you've recently had a blood transfusion or received blood.

If you have tuberculosis.

If you've had other vaccines in the past four weeks.

If you feel unwell or ill.

The CDC says patients should tell their doctors if they have a history of seizures or a parent or sibling with a history of seizures; or are planning to take a salicylate such as aspirin.

Possible side effects of the vaccine, which the CDC says are usually mild, include soreness, redness or swelling; fever; mild rash; and temporary pain and stiffness in the joints.

More serious side effects, which theCDCsays are rare, could include a high fever leading to a seizure.

The virus was declared eradicated in 2000,USA TODAY reported, but as of July 9, 2025, they've reached a peak, with outbreaks in at least 38 states since the beginning of the year.

According to theMayo Clinic, measles is especially serious and potentially deadly for children younger than 5 and people with severely weakened immune systems.

Symptoms listed by the Mayo Clinic include:

Fever as high as 105 degrees.

Dry cough.

Runny nose.

(WMBD) — The state’s public health watchdog agency will discuss the rise in measles cases and what people can do to protect themselves.

During the 10 a.m. press conference, the Illinois Department of Public Health said the Southern Illinois outbreak of measles is “over,” and was capped at eight cases. A few cases that were found in northern Illinois were not linked to that outbreak, officials said.

The eight cases in the southern part of the state were found in April and May, the agency said.

The two cases in Cook County that were identified around the same time did not constitute an outbreak, and there was no further indication of any additional spread beyond those two individuals, according to the department.

The reason the department says the outbreak is over is thatwo full incubation periods — 42 days — have elapsed since the last confirmed case, allowing the Department to declare the outbreak over.

“The end of this outbreak, capping at just 8 cases and no serious illnesses in Illinois, is a testament to the deliberate, decisive, and successful work of our public health and medical professionals,” said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. “Public health is made stronger by the power of partnership, and this measles response was a coordinated effort that included IDPH, local health departments, as well as other dedicated community and health care partners.

He said that vaccination is the most effective tool to prevent measles.

“I recommend that Illinois residents make sure that they and their family members are up to date on the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations,” he added.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/schumer-presses-rfk-jr-declare-164754913.html,2025-07-11 19:00:00,Schumer presses RFK Jr. to declare measles emergency,"Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) called on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to immediately declare a public health emergency for measles, blaming the senior Trump administration official for failing to respond to the rapid resurgence of the disease.

Schumer accused Kennedy in abluntly worded letterFriday of walking “our country into the nation’s largest measles outbreak in 33 years, leading cases to hit a record high a full 25 years after this country eliminated the disease.”

Schumer said what began as a localized outbreak in Texas has now “exploded” into a nationwide health crisis with nearly 1,300 Americans across 38 states reported to have become infected.

“To prevent this historic record high spread from reaching further and to save lives, you should immediately declare a Public Health Emergency for measles,” Schumer wrote.

The Democratic leader expressed his “deep concern” about Kennedy’s “response — or lack thereof — to the rapid resurgence of measles across the United States.”

“Under your tutelage as secretary, you have undermined vaccines, gutted public health funding, and dismantled core federal protections meant to keep Americans safe,” he wrote.

Schumer cited the mass layoffs of federal health care employees, including infectious disease scientists, the “careless and devastating” freezing of grants and Kennedy’soverhaul of theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Kennedy last monthremoved all 17 membersfrom the advisory committee that guides vaccine policy and recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

“As a painful but pertinent reminder, you’ve laid off disease experts, canceled National Institutes of Health (NIH) research into vaccine hesitancy, fired scientists from the nation’s top immunization panel, and stripped over $11 billion in federal public health grants — including $550 million from Texas during the peak of its outbreak,” he wrote.

He said that resulted in 50 vaccine clinics closing and 21 public health workers losing their jobs in Dallas County alone.

Schumer noted that while measles is a highly contagious virus, it’s also preventable and was declared eliminated in the Untied States in 2000 after years of a nationwide campaign to give children two doses of the measles vaccine.

“This is a catastrophe of your own making. And while families grieved and health departments begged for help, you told the public that ‘it’s not unusual’ to see measles deaths. You pushed vitamin A instead of vaccines,” he said.

And he highlighted that even after Kennedy acknowledged that the MMR vaccine prevents measles, he continued to sow doubts about whether vaccines are linked to autism, something the Democrat called “a dangerous, long-debunked conspiracy theory.”

“Secretary Kennedy, the American people need a public health response. Not political theater. Not conspiracy. Not silence,” Schumer wrote.

Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are coming under more scrutiny for their votes to confirm Kennedy in February.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) was pressed Thursday by a reporter for NBC News to “reconcile” his support for Kennedy’s nomination earlier this year with his acknowledgement that vaccine “skepticism” has contributed to the new rise in measles infections.

“First, let’s note that RFK [Jr.] has come out and told people that they should be vaccinated, so that’s easily reconcilable. He is now saying that people should be vaccinated for measles,” Cassidy said.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) was asked about his support for Kennedy during a CNN interview with Jake Tapper.

Tillis told CNN: “The main reason I supported Kennedy was because Bill Cassidy thought that we should see how it plays out.”

Cassidy is up for reelection next year, and Tillis recently announced his retirement.

Schumer in his letter Friday accused Kennedy of continuing to undermine the nation’s vaccine programs.

He called on the secretary to declare a nationwide emergency to expand resources and leverage funding, personnel and other resources toward limiting the outbreak.

Schumer argued that Kennedy’s continued skepticism of vaccine safety, the termination of National Institutes of Health grants for vaccine hesitancy studies and the firing of vaccine experts from the CDC “have undoubtedly exacerbated the severity of the measles outbreak.”

In April and May, eight people in southern Illinois, “all linked to one another,” contracted measles, the Illinois Department of Public Health said Friday. But with no new cases identified since May 22, enough time has now passed to consider the outbreak over, the state said.

As of this week, more than 1,200 measles cases had been confirmed nationwide this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the highest annual number since the disease was officially declared eliminated in 2000. Three people with measles, including two children, have died.

“In Illinois, we’re relieved to tell a much different story,” Dr. Sameer Vohra, director of IDPH, said at a news conference Friday in Springfield.

Of eight people in the downstate outbreak, none fell seriously ill, Vohra said. Also this spring, health officials identified two unrelated measles cases in Cook County but didn’t see indication of additional spread, IDPH said.

Officials identified the first case downstate this year in anunvaccinated adult in Marion,near the southern tip of Illinois. All of the state’s cases this year have been adults, Dr. Jennifer Seo, an adviser in pediatric medicine at IDPH, said.

IDPH declined to release additional demographic information about those who contracted measles, citing medical privacy rules.

Local departments including the Franklin-Williamson Bi-County Health Department and Jackson County Health Department held vaccine outreach clinics to contain the spread in those areas, IDPH said. Local officials went business to business to offer vaccinations, and the state health department also held mobile vaccination clinics, IDPH officials said.

Amid those efforts, more than twice as many individuals in Franklin, Williamson and Jackson counties received vaccinations each month compared with January, Seo said. All three counties already had high vaccination rates above 96% in schools, which helped contain the spread, she said.

State officials took quick action downstate this year after seeing a much larger outbreak in Chicago last year, Vohra said. That outbreak, which rose to 64 cases, primarily affected migrants in a shelter on the Lower West Side, according to a report from the city’s Department of Public Health.

Measles spreads through the air or when a person comes into contact with an infected person’s mucus or saliva, according to state public health information. It is particularly dangerous to babies and young children.

In March 2024 public health officials identifiedthe first case of measles in the city since 2019on the Northwest Side. The next day, officials reportedthe first positive casein the migrant shelter, where nearly 2,500 people lived in close quarters.

Vaccination rates in the U.S. have dropped since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to IDPH.

As recently as this spring, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the measles vaccine causes “adverse events” and suggested its effectiveness wanes quickly,The Associated Press reported.

The CDC says the vaccine is safe and effective.

All three people in the U.S. that died with measles this year were unvaccinated. Before this year, there had not been a measles death in the U.S. for a decade.

Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are considered 97% protective against the measles, and one dose is considered 93% protective, according to the CDC. Children typically receive the first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine at age 12 to 15 months, and the second dose from ages 4 to 6.

Even before the beginning of the downstate outbreak, health officials targeted communications about disease prevention to ZIP codes with low school vaccination rates and saw an uptick in vaccination as early as March, Seo said.

With cases still relatively high across the country, the state public health department remains vigilant, said Vohra, who is also a pediatrician.

“It could return here, possibly quickly,” he said."

(WAVY) —  Summer means mosquitoes, and that means a higher risk of getting West Nile virus, and while symptoms are often mild, it can present problems for older adults.

This virus is nothing new. The first U.S. outbreak actually took place in 1999. Fast forward to the current year and the country’s in the midst of a new flare-up, but does it affect the Commonwealth?

Well, per theCDC, Virginia has landed on a list of 14 states hit with West Nile virus human disease cases in 2025.

Dr. Prachi Chavan with the Old Dominion University-Norfolk State University Joint School of Public Health said the first case in the Commonwealth dates back to 2002. And as for the most recent trend spreading nationwide, it’s weather-influenced.

“Right now, we are experiencing the hottest weather,” she said. “Forever, we are surrounded by water, so if you look at the statistics, the number of cases have been rising, especially from the year 2021 in and around the Hampton Roads region.”

On a broad scale, summer going into early fall is when the bite rate is highest, but in the south where warmer temperatures hover year-round, a consistent breeding ground is formed.

There is a specific type of mosquito that spreads this virus — the culex pipiens species.

“Only one and five people who are bitten by this mosquito or who get this virus actually show symptoms,” Chavan said. “Twenty percent of the people show symptoms, 80% remain asymptomatic and less than 1% actually show very severe symptoms.

West Nile becomes fatal if it develops into severe infections such as meningitis or encephalitis.

“In this situation, the person can become paralyzed, the person can slip into coma,” she said. “People who are greater than 50 or greater than 60 years of age, or if they have, immunocompromised conditions such as cancer or diabetes are at more risk of actually getting the West Nile virus.”

West Nile Virus symptoms are typically flu-like, and there is currently no treatment or vaccine on the market.

Officials are reminding residents to make sure that they are up to date on immunizations.

While these results are not a surprise to public health officials, it does confirm that measles is circulating in Utah County and that taking precautions is necessary. DHHS reiterated that the best protection against measles is the MMR vaccine.

Currently,nine Utah residents have been confirmed to have measles, and seven of those cases were in Utah County.

MORE ABOUT MEASLES: 2 new measles cases in Utah, bringing total cases to 9

“Wastewater sampling is a new and useful tool for public health,” Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist at DHHS is quoted in a press release. “In this case, we know someone had measles in the Provo area around the time the sample was taken. It’s possible these wastewater results simply reflect that person.”

The data was reported byWastewaterSCAN, a program based at Stanford University that monitors infectious diseases in wastewater systems across the country. DHHS is also working to set up wastewater monitoring sites across the state to check for measles, but it’s not fully functional yet.

Dr. Nolen also explained that wastewater data is most useful to detect diseases in areas where no cases have been identified. “When that happens, we will be able to use the data to alert clinicians in those areas to make sure they are aware someone with measles may come in for care.”

According to Nathan LaCross, the manager of the DHHS Utah Wastewater Surveillance system, when people get sick with the measles, they can shed the virus in their feces or urine. The virus then goes into wastewater or sewer systems, and it can be detected for days to weeks in wastewater samples.

That can help DHHS identify communities where people are infected with measles, sometimes even before DHHS knows anyone is sick.

Samples are collected at the water treatment plant, and so it can’t be used to identify a specific person. It also cannot be traced back to households or individuals.

Myths VS Facts: What health officials want you to know about the MMR vaccine

According to DHHS, 90% of Utahns are vaccinated against measles. DHHS is urging those who are not vaccinated to get the MMR vaccine. Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolan saysthat the most effective prevention against the measles is vaccination.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles, while two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC. TheCDCsays that although some vaccinated people may still get measles, mumps, or rubella if exposed to the viruses, their symptoms will generally be milder, and they will be less likely to spread the disease.

As of July 1, 2025, a total of1,267 confirmed measles cases were reportedby 37 jurisdictions in the United States, according to the latest information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

According to astudy conducted by the DHHS, immunization rates with specific vaccines have decreased amongst kindergarteners throughout Utah since 2014. Amelia Salmanson, a measles epidemiologist with the DHHS, told ABC4.com that anyone who is exhibiting measles symptoms or is sick should do their best to “stay home and away from others”. They can also call ahead when seeking care so clinics can prevent spread in their waiting rooms.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads easily through the air through coughing and sneezing. The CDC said those infected won’t see symptoms appear until about a week after infection, andcommon symptoms include high fever, cough, and a rash.

Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin.

Measles can cause serious health complications, especially for those who are not protected through the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The measles rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms. It usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline. They then spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet.

Utah has largely beenspared from measles casesin the last 10 years. There have only been five confirmed cases since 2015, including three in 2017. However, Utah has had a couple of scares in recent weeks after a passenger with measlestraveled through the Salt Lake.

While the national definition considers three or more cases as an outbreak, Utah defines an outbreak as one or more case. However, since most cases have been isolated within individual households, the DHHS is using the term ‘Cluster’.

Amelia Salmanson notes that the organization has been preparing for measles in Utah for at least a year and have been working to reduce measles transmission outside of the identified households.

“We’ve been working really closely with our local health departments and our clinical partners to develop plans and processes to ensure that the transmission of measles stays ideally within kind of that immediate group,” Amelia Salmanson, DHHS measles epidemiologist

According to Salmanson, all of the individuals with measles are in stable condition, including the two pregnant women and one minor.

Ky (WEHT) – El Tapatio restaurant has been temporarily closed for training and maintenance while the Hopkins County Health Department investigates a giardia outbreak, they say traces back to the restaurant.

Giardia is classified as a parasite which can cause intestinal issues. The illness can be contracted from water sources like lakes, pools or streams. But it can also be spread from unwashed hands touching food and other surfaces after using the bathroom.

The county has seen over 20 reported cases in the past month.

It is still unclear where the outbreak stems from within the restaurant but a temperature excursion in the walk-in refrigerator is noted in the press release.

The health department also stated there could be other places responsible for the outbreak. Officials say there is currently no concern with drinking water in the county.

Health officials say anyone with symptoms of Giardia should get tested. They also encourage people with the illness to not go to work until they are clear of symptoms for 24 hours.

It is still unclear when the first case happened at the establishment or how many cases stem from the restaurant.

Officials will be contacting everyone who contracted the illness to conduct an investigation. The investigation is ongoing and El Tapatio has been cooperating with the department so far.

Rose participated in the D-Day landings on June 6, 1944, and was part of the division that liberated theBergen-Belsen concentration campin northern Germany.

In a statement Friday, the leader of the Erewash Borough Council in the north of England, James Dawson, announced Rose's death, calling him a “war hero.”

“Erewash was privileged to count him as a resident,"" he added.

In May, Rose joined 45 other veterans as guests of honor at a tea party celebration hosted by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial Arboretum, to mark 80 years sinceVictory in Europe Day.

Rose, who was born on Christmas Eve in 1914 following the outbreak of hostilities in World War I, said at the event that he did not celebrate VE Day at the time.

“When I heard that the armistice had been signed 80 years ago, I was in Germany at Belsen and, like most active soldiers, I didn’t get to celebrate at that time,"" he said. “We just did what we thought was right and it was a relief when it was over.”

Originally from the village of Westcott, southwest of London, Rose joined the army aged 23 and served in North Africa, Italy and France, according to the Royal British Legion. He received a number of medals and was awarded France’s highest honor, the Legion d’Honneur.

Rose is also believed to have been the U.K.’s oldest man."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-more-chemtrails-maha-ky-090000638.html,2025-07-12 16:00:00,No more chemtrails. MAHA-KY will focus on healing power of nutritious food | Opinion,"Here’s the first complication for Kentucky’s Make America Healthy Again task force: for every policy push, there’s a pull.

So while health and nutrition experts gathered at the second MAHA-KY meeting in Frankfort on July 10, there was an even larger group of clearly concerned soft drink and grocery employees and lobbyists.

As the nutrition experts detailed why Kentuckians have so much trouble accessing the healthy food that could promote better health, the soft drink companies detailed exactly how many jobs — 4,000 — and how much annual economic impact —$552 million in wages and benefits — they bring to the commonwealth. In other words, they implied, don’t try to limit soft drink consumption in service of better health.

Even if Kentucky does rank 46th in the country for health.

Here’s the second complication: at the same time the committee, chaired by Sen. Shelly Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, and Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, tries to explore ways to make Kentucky’s health better, President Donald Trump’s administration is unraveling the programs that could aid them.

For example,the DOGE cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculturehave killed two programs that buy fresh meat and vegetables from Kentucky farmers for schools and food banks. The Local Food Purchase Assistance Program will lose $11 million by August. More than 130 local farmers also make money from the Local Food for Schools program.

Funke Frommeyer said she had not talked to anyone in Washington D.C. about those cuts. And she had scheduled Thursday’s meeting on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program long before the “Big, Beautiful Bill” passed with hugecuts to both SNAP and Medicaid,two programs that have real influence on Kentucky’s health.

SNAP was on the agenda because she and Locketthad filed legislationthis year to restrict soda and junk food from SNAP benefits, which states can do with a waiver. However, waivers create a lot more work for states and for the retailers who have to block the purchases of soda and junk food so the bill didn’t go anywhere.

“In the process of filing that we recognized the friction it was creating with the beverage companies and some of our wonderful organizations,” she said after the meeting. “So as we did for the research, we also recognized that creating that waiver would also bloat our government, and we’re not interested in bloating the government.”

That’s where the impasse stands.

It’s hard to make big changes in the health of a state, especially when federal forces are making larger changes. Funke Frommeyer rightly believes education is the key to better health, but the “Big, Beautiful Bill” just cut all funding for the SNAP Ed program, which teaches people about nutrition and how to cook healthy food.

Unlike the first MAHA-KY meeting, this one was light on fun topics like chemtrails and whether we should put fluoride in our water.

It was heavy on topics like food deserts and the healing power of food that is not heavily processed. Kentucky is chock-full of health problems related to diet, like nearly 14% of the population with diabetes, and 15% suffering from three or more chronic conditions.

But Funke Frommeyer said the task force will stick to nutrition, which she believes is crucial to solving our health woes.

Someone else can take up themeasles outbreakcurrently happening in the state.

At the next meeting in August, Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell will discuss local food and farming, and then she hopes to hear from health care providers about how they are recognizing food’s place in medical care.

By December, she said, the task force should have some policy ideas that can be presented as legislation in the 2026 session.

“Kentucky has a whole lot of dollars being spent on chronic illnesses,” she said. “We’ve double-dipped into the taxpayer dollars because some of our SNAP dollars are being spent on things that are also causing health issues,” she said.

Those problems then get paid for with Medicaid dollars.

“So then we have spent double the money,” she said. “So we do need to more carefully embrace what nutrition is being consumed.”

That’s hard to argue with. But turning these admirable goals into laws, well, it’s like trying to make the proverbial political sausage amid arguments from the pork lobbyists, pork farmers, pig sanctuaries, low-fat evangelists and vegan nutritionists.

That’s when the complications begin."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/independence-day-floods-among-texas-224539791.html,2025-07-13 01:45:00,Independence Day floods among Texas’ most devastating natural disasters,"AUSTIN (KXAN) — A week has passed since Central Texas was struck with catastrophic flash flooding over the July 4 weekend. While many questions remain unanswered, and communities across the state are only in the beginning stages of recovery, it is becoming more clear just how devastating and fatal the weather event was.

The floods claimed the lives of at least 129 people. At least 166 people remain missing, as of the latest updates from officials Friday evening.

AccuWeather estimatedthat the floods have caused between $18 billion and $22 billion in total damage.

MAP: Where have flash flooding deaths been confirmed in Texas?

The Hill Country flooding event is already among some of the worst natural disasters in Texas’ history.

Below is a breakdown of some of the state’s most devastating weather disasters since 1900, citing information from the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, National Centers for Environmental Information, Texas State Historical Association and other local officials.

Ahistoric cold wave and winter stormimpacted many northwest, central and eastern states in February 2021. The prolonged arctic air caused widespread power outages in Texas and other southern states.

In Texas, extreme conditions caused or contributed to the direct and indirect deaths of more than 210 people, according to NCEI data. The estimated CPI-adjusted damage cost was around $27.2 billion.

On Aug. 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey became the first Category 4 storm to hit the United States since 2004, and the first to hit the Texas coast since1970, according to theNational Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service(NESDIS).

Hurricane Harvey caused a CPI-adjusted estimated cost of$158.8 billionin damages, making it thesecond-most costly hurricanein U.S. history, only behind Hurricane Katrina, per NESDIS.

Harvey claimed the lives of 89 direct victims, and many more suffered long-term consequences from the floodwaters, mold, and other hazards left behind from the storm, NESDIS noted.

Hurricane Ikemade landfall near Galveston on Sept. 12, 2008 as a Category 2 hurricane. It was the largest (in size) Atlantic hurricane on record and caused considerable storm surge in coastal Texas and significant wind and flooding damage, per NCEI.

At least 112 people in the U.S. died during the storm. TheTexas Department of State Health Services identified74 deaths in Texas as directly, indirectly, or possibly related to Ike.

The CPI-adjusted estimated cost in damages caused by Hurricane Ike was $43.2 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).

Category 3 Hurricane Rita hit the Texas-Louisiana border coastal region on Sept. 20., 2005. At least 119 people died in the storm, and the CPI-adjusted cost in damages was $29.4 billion, according to NCEI.

Tropical Storm Allisonproduced rainfall amounts of 30-40 inches in portions of coastal Texas and Louisiana, causing severe flooding especially in the Houston area, according to NCEI.

The storm caused 43 deaths and an estimated CPI-adjusted damage cost of $15.1 billion.

Hurricane Carla was the largest hurricane of record in Texas, according to theTexas State Historical Association. It occurred Sept. 8–14, 1961, on the Texas coast near Galveston.

The total damage to property and crops amounted to over $300 million. According to the TSHA, because about 250,000 people were evacuated from the coastal region, only 34 were killed and 465 were injured.

On May 11, 1953, a tornado hit Waco, killing 114 people and injuring 600, according toWacoHistory.org.

According to the website, approximately $51 million of property damages occurred.

On Sept. 9, 1921, a storm event moved through Central Texas and produced between 7-14 inches of rainfall across San Antonio, which drained into the San Antonio River and flowed south through the center of the city,according to the San Antonio River Authority. It resulted in a devastating flood event on the San Antonio River and tributaries to the west of downtown.

Damages totaled $3.7 million (over $56 million in 2021). The official death toll counted 51 people who died in the flood, according to the authority.

TheGalveston hurricane of 1900, which happened Sept. 8–9, is known as the worst natural disaster in United States history, according to theTexas State Historical Association.

It’s estimated that between 6,000-8,000 people died, and property loss was estimated at around $40 million, per the TSHA. Flooding caused most of the damage.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/didn-t-vaccinate-children-mmr-141719714.html,2025-07-13 16:00:00,I didn’t vaccinate my children with the MMR jab – but now I’m having regrets,"Olivia*, 56, lives in west London with her husband and twins aged 14. Their oldest son, 19, is at university

I’m neither a hippynor someone who set out to make “alternative” choices. Yet nearly two decades ago, when my eldest was born, I decided not to vaccinate him with the MMR jab. And when his twin siblings arrived four years later, I made the same decision for them.

Admittedly, this is something I’ve kept quiet about over the years. I never even told my own mother as I knew she would worry – and disapprove. Yet today, reading the heartbreakingnews that a child has died in Liverpool after contracting measles, I’m feeling anxious and now questioning whether I did the right thing.

At the time, it didn’t feel radical; it was instinctive. It just did not feel right to inject my precious, much longed-for babies with a live vaccine. I was also influenced by a close friend who was passionate about natural health and homeopathy. She was someone I trusted – intelligent and thorough – and her arguments about the pharmaceutical industry’s vested interests made me think.

The MMR jab was first introduced in the UK in 1988, so I didn’t have it myself, (though I do know my mother would have given it to me had it then been an option). I remember getting both mumps and measles but these illnesses were part of childhood I believed – unpleasant but survivable. My eldest did eventually catch mumps, and he was fine.

I can’t pretend that I wasn’t affected by reading the claims ofthe now disgraced British doctor, Andrew Wakefield. His paper inThe Lancetinfamously suggested there was a link to the MMR jab and autism.

WhileThe Lancetcompletely retracted the paper in 2010, and his claims were struck off before then by many, the controversy made me wary. Raising my young family in west London, I was surrounded by several other parents dealing with autism diagnoses. Unlike measles, where I didn’t know anyone affected, autism felt more of a threat.

So, with my husband’s backing, I didn’t vaccinate them. I honestly don’t remember ever feeling bullied by my healthcare professionals at the time. Doctors never challenged me, however over the years when I’ve taken them for the inevitable A&E trips (broken fingers and the like) I have been asked whether they’re “up to date with their jabs” and I’ve had to explain my decision. I don’t think I was even met with raised eyebrows any time, because it’s common, especially in London where (according to statistics in from 2021-2022) one in five haven’t been inoculated by the time they’re aged three.

I vaguely recall it being discussed at baby groups with other mums and I kept quiet. I suppose I sensed there was a stigma, but I also felt it was a private decision for me to make.

My children all attended local state school, and teachers and other parents at the school gate never once asked me and it never came up in conversation. I would have been honest if it had despite not advertising the fact. It’s most likely they would have assumed I’d ticked the box like everyone else.

I’ve never been a militant anti-vaxxer, and all our family hadthe Covid jabswhen the pandemic struck. I didn’t hesitate about that because – like the rest of the country back then – I was frightened of Covid, this unknown new virus which killed.

But things change. Every time news hits about a new outbreak of measles I get anxiety. The first time I felt anything close to regret about my decision was when my eldest went off to university, and there was doubt. Was I putting him at unnecessary risk? I even contacted our GP to see if we could arrange the vaccinations before he left. They never got back to me, I never chased and life moved on. But moments like this – tragic stories of unvaccinated children dying – bring back the uncertainty.

I know people will claim I’ve been irresponsible, and now I am wondering if I should have made a different decision. The good news is that I can still get them vaccinated. My oldest of course will have to make his own decision now he’s an adult. But I plan to talk to him – as well as the 14 year olds – about getting the jabs.

If something were to happen to my children because of my decision, I would never forgive myself. Yet back then, with the knowledge I had, I believed I was making the best choice I could. Isn’t that the uncomfortable truth about parenting? You make your decisions out of love and fear and instinct, and sometimes you only know if they were right years down the line.

The death of a child is something I can’t ignore. I hope that other people, like me, who might be less sure of themselves now might re-think their decisions. Far more important then being “right” is the chance to save another child from dying from an illness that can be prevented.

*Name changed to protect identity

As told to Susanna Galton

“Measles is very contagious and if the virus is circulating in the community because of low vaccination rates, sooner or later it will find its way to kids who are already unwell, where the infection can be catastrophic,” says Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading.

“We do see children and adults dying from measles in the UK and the last young person who died [before today’s news] was reported in 2024,” says virologist Dr Connor Bamford, of Queen’s University Belfast. “In 2023 we saw another child die of a disease called SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), which is a fatal complication of measles that occurs years after an earlier infection. In 2023 two adults also died.

“Unfortunately this [death] is not unexpected given that despite being vaccine-preventable measles has not yet been eradicated, in fact Europe (and other parts of the world like North America) is experiencing an increases in measles cases, and there remains too high a level of unvaccinated individuals.”

“Various conditions can make individuals more vulnerable to severe measles,” says Dr Bamford. “This may include immunosuppressed individuals undergoing cancer treatment for example, who because of their condition have lost immunity to the virus, even if they have been vaccinated.”

“The only way to stop measles spreading is with vaccination,” says Prof Helen Bedford, professor of children’s health at University College London. “ MMR has a good safety record, and two doses give about 98 per cent protection. We need to have sustained 95 per cent uptake of two doses of the MMR vaccine, but in England only 84 per cent of five-year-old children have had the two doses and in some parts of the country, including Liverpool and parts of London, uptake is much lower,”

If parents are unsure whether their child has had the vaccine, they can check their red book or call the GP practice, says Prof Bedford. “For questions and concerns about vaccination speak to your GP, practice nurse or health visitor. It is never too late to be vaccinated even as an adult.”

Aside from the wholesale prices (and quantities), it also offersa large section of prepared foodsall sold under the Kirkland Signature brand. The popular rotisserie chicken salad is included in that lineup, but in 2015, it was actually the subject of one ofthe biggest Costco recalls of all time, which saw five customers hospitalized.

In October and November 2015, 19 people got infected with a special strain of E. coli that was traced back to Costco's rotisserie chicken salad. The cases were recorded in California, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Five people had to be hospitalized, two of whom developed kidney failure — though thankfully, nobody died as a result of the infection.

Costco recalled the salad nationwide and worked closely with the authorities to find the potential source of the E. coli outbreak. While there was no official conclusion as to which ingredient in particular was contaminated, one test showed the diced celery and onion mix to be the culprit. As a result, the supplier of that veggie blend, Taylor Farms Pacific, recalled not just the celery and onion mix but several other celery-based products sold at other retailers as well. The outbreak was contained by late November 2015.

Believe it or not, the Rotisserie Chicken was not the only salad recall Costco experienced in 2015. There were two other salad recalls, both from Canada. First came the Roasted Chicken Salad, recalled in April for fear of listeria contamination. The product was recalled from the shelves in nine Canadian provinces, and no illnesses were reported.

Then, around the same time that the Rotisserie Chicken Salad recall was going on, Canadian Costco shoppers were met with a Quinoa Salad recall in early November. The recall only impacted the Quinoa Salad sold at one specific warehouse in Ontario, but it did come as a result of people getting ill. The wholesaler, however, kept mum on the details of the illnesses and what type of contamination was suspected. While recalls certainly shake the trust that customers have in the brand, Costco's loyal shoppers ultimately didn't hold the salad recalls against the grocery chain. The Rotisserie Chicken salad is still available at Costco a decade later, despite the fact that it costs about thrice as much asthe $4.99 full rotisserie chicken.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/chikungunya-virus-might-not-know-140532667.html,2025-07-14 15:30:00,Chikungunya: The virus you might not know you need to worry about,"Malaria, dengue, yellow fever: Most European travellers heading to sub-tropical regions know to make sure they're up to date on their vaccinations.

While those mosquito-borne diseases are relatively well known, you may not yet have heard of chikungunya, a viral disease that is actually not uncommon among travellers.

Usually transmitted by Asian tiger mosquitoes, chikungunya causes flu-like symptoms, including high fever, headaches and joint pain.

While most infected people recover after around one week, the virus can be dangerous for pregnant women, infants and people with chronic illnesses.

A domestically transmitted case, such as one recently recorded in France, which saw a man reportedly infected by a mosquito bite while staying just south of Strasbourg, is quite rare, as the disease is not endemic to Europe.

But if you are headed to a country that has recently seen an outbreak, the risk of contracting chikungunya increases significantly.

At the moment, those include Bolivia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, La Réunion and Sri Lanka, according to Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).

In 2025 so far, most cases reported worldwide have been detected in the Americas, with Brazil topping the list, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU's health agency.

Here's what you can do to protect yourself against chikungunya, and how to recognize that you contracted the disease.

How to protect yourself

The good news first: There are two vaccines against chikungunya that have been approved in the European Union.

Vimkunya, the latest vaccine to receive market authorisation only this year, is also the first vaccine in the EU recommended for use for kids aged 12 and older, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Both Vimkunya and Ixchiq, which was approved in 2024, are given as a single dose. Germany's RKI health officials recommend getting vaccinated if you are planning to travel to a country where there's been a recent chikungunya outbreak.

If you are staying in a region where the virus is endemic for at least four weeks, or if you are planning a number of shorter trips to areas where chikungunya is prevalent, you should also consider vaccination, especially if you are over 60 or suffer from serious underlying conditions such as kidney, heart and lung disease.

If you are unsure whether you need the vaccine, consult with your GP at least two weeks before travelling, to allow for enough time for immunization to take effect, the RKI says.

How to recognize chikungunya

The name of the virus reflects ""the way patients often bend over in pain,"" according to the ECDC.

Those contracting the disease almost always display symptoms, starting three to seven days post-infection, the agency says.

However, it can take as long as 12 days for symptoms to appear. The most common symptoms include sudden fever, joint pain and a rash. Patients also suffer from chills and headaches.

""Most people recover, but 30-40% of those affected may develop chronic arthritis that can last for months or even years,"" the ECDC says.

There are no specific antiviral drugs to treat chikungunya once you've contracted the disease. All you can do is take pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medicines to alleviate the symptoms, according to the watchdog.

Preventive measures

Even if you're vaccinated, you should always protect yourself against mosquito bites.

Other steps to take to avoid infection include wearing light clothing that covers your entire body. Use insect repellents that contain at least 30% diethyltoluamide, an active ingredient used to repel insects.

Put a mosquito net over your bed while sleeping and make sure the windows and doors are covered by nets as well."

Here's What That Means.,"The U.S. has reported more measles cases in the first half of this year than in any full year since 1992, raising concerns that the country could lose its measles elimination status and undo a 25-year public health victory amid declining vaccine rates.

But exactly what does that risk mean and how close is it to really happening?

For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.Support our missionto keep us around for the next 20 — we can’t do this without you.

The World Health Organization sets the criteria forelimination status,requiring a country — or defined geographical area — to go at least 12 months without continuous domestic transmission of a virus. That means any new outbreaks during that time must come from people who contracted the virus from outside, not inside, the U.S.

Under that criteria, the U.S. has until January to eliminate the nation’s current outbreaks, which is a year after cases started domestically in Texas, according to epidemiology experts. If it doesn’t, the U.S.’s measles elimination status could be taken away.

“It could be more impactful than a lot of Americans think about since we have had measles elimination status for so long,” Brittany Kmush, associate professor and graduate director of Syracuse University’s Public Health Department, told HuffPost.

“It could affect U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to specific countries if they don’t want the risk of measles getting introduced to their country. It could affect other people’s ability to come visit the U.S. Other countries might require proof of measles vaccination before they can reenter their home country,” she said.

There could also be increased quarantine and isolation requirements, with potential economic fallout, she said.

On top of this, many more people could be at risk of contracting the virus, which is considered one of the most contagious in the world. If just one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“It’s not just a cold for a lot of people. It can lead to phenomena and in rare cases encephalitis and death,” said Kmush. Children younger than 5 years of age are especially vulnerable to severe illness and health complications.

Fortunately, there’s still time this year to fight outbreaks. Losing the elimination status is also purposely made challenging because, unless the virus is globally eradicated ― a feat only seen with smallpox ― there’s always going to be cases brought into the U.S. from outside, said William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center, who co-leads the school’s measles tracking project.

“As long as there’s measles virus circulating somewhere in the world, there’s always going to be these importations,” he told HuffPost.“It would be very hard to maintain measles elimination status if every time someone brought it in and there was another case, you would lose it.”

Whether or not outbreaks will stop before the deadline remains uncertain, however.

Measles cases in the U.S. have been dropping since their peak in March, giving hope that outbreaks may be petering out. But vaccination rates remain at their lowest in years in the U.S., reducingso-called “herd immunity”and opening the door for new outbreaks to ignite in communities that have low vaccination rates.

“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak,” said Moss, while comparing the chances to a hot ember drifting from a wildfire.

“If it lands in a wet area, you’re not going to have an outbreak if there’s high vaccine coverage. But if it enters an area with really low vaccine coverage, you could have another really large outbreak,” he said.

With less than six months left in the year, Moss says it’s still too early to start a countdown or “really sweat about this.” He also said that even if elimination status is lost, cases are at least unlikely to return to the levels seen in the early 1990s, since vaccine levels do remain reasonably high.

Kmush, however, expressed more caution on the chances of elimination being a reality.

“I am definitely alarmed,” she said, while pointing out that the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status in 2019 when there were fewer cases than those seen this year. She credited a rise in vaccine coverage and public health advocacy toward the end of that year for sparing the U.S. from losing its status.

“We were able to get them vaccinated and do the quarantine and isolation,” she said of vulnerable communities. “Unfortunately, measles vaccination rates are even lower now than they were in 2019 and 99% of the cases that have been reported in this outbreak are either not vaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.”

She and Moss both also stressed that the U.S. getting its elimination status back after losing it is also no easy feat.

A country would have to show zero continuous transmission of the virus domestically for 36 months, as well as demonstrate a good virus surveillance system, which Moss said the U.S. does have.

As far as what can be done now, Kmush said more people need to get vaccinated, calling it “the greatest tool” in decreasing cases and protecting those who are unable to get vaccinated, such as babies younger than six months of age or people who are immunocompromised.

“You can do quarantine, isolation, similar to the idea with COVID, but measles is a lot more contagious than COVID,” she said. “And so we really need everyone who is eligible to get the vaccine.”

She also stressed that federal health officials need to do more to reduce vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.

“I think certain administrators and their views on vaccines have been fueling some of this vaccine hesitancy and people’s reluctance to receive a vaccine that’s been proven safe and effective for decades,” she said. “The policies and some of the vaccine hesitancy and skepticism rhetoric is definitely dangerous and going to make people who are unsure about vaccines even more unsure, when they really shouldn’t be.”

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has no formal medical background and has a long record of anti-vaccine advocacy and other conspiracy theories, is among those who has offered inconsistent and tepid support for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Earlier this year, he falsely claimed that the current vaccine administered, which wasfirst distributedin 1968, hasn’t been safely tested and that its protection is short-lived. That’s despite widespread use of the vaccine being credited with achieving the nation’s elimination status in 2000 and saving hundreds of lives each year.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died annually in the U.S., accordingto the CDC.

A HHS spokesperson, when recently contacted by HuffPost about the rise in cases, said that measles infection risks remain low for the overall U.S. population, “lower than peer developed countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy.”

“CDC continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles,” the spokesperson added, while calling the decision to vaccinate “a personal one.”

“People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get inoculated and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,” they said.

Pepsi is a consumer goods company that has underperformed its competitor, Coca-Cola, in recent years. While Coca-Cola has gone up by 103% in the last 2 years, Pepsi is down 24%. Pepsi earns more from its snack division than from its beverages. The company had significantly raised its product prices after its strong results running up to 2023, but persistently high inflation in 2023 meant that consumers cut down on snacks or chose cheaper alternatives to Pepsi.

The company missed its sales forecasts and had to reduce its organic growth projection. Adding to the already weaker demand, Pepsi had to recall Quaker Oats due to a potential Salmonella outbreak. However, the Quaker recall has been fully closed by the FDA, and management has said that Quaker drove strong organic revenue growth in Q1'25. Easing inflationary pressures and improving consumer confidence could boost spending on discretionary items, especially on snacks.

Pepsi's rebound catalysts are promising, with potential for significant upside. The company's recent acquisition of prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and the growth of its high-margin products, such as Pepsi Zero, Propel functional water, and Gatorade Zero, could lead to increased revenue and profitability. Additionally, the company's efforts to boost volume through smaller packaging could also contribute to its growth.

Previously we covered abullish thesison PepsiCo, Inc. by Charts&Companies in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s undervaluation relative to Coca-Cola, stronger capital efficiency, and balanced revenue mix between beverages and high-margin snacks. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately 2.7% since our coverage. This is because the original thesis is still playing out, but slowly. Rebound Capital shares a similar view but emphasizes recent catalysts such as easing inflation, new product launches, and the Poppi acquisition.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/cuomo-staying-nyc-mayor-race-191401193.html,2025-07-14 19:45:00,Cuomo stays in NYC mayor’s race despite losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani,"Former Gov.Andrew Cuomolaunched an independent run for New York City mayor on Monday, restarting his campaign after a bruising loss to progressiveZohran Mamdaniin the Democratic primary.

In a video, Cuomo announced he would remain in the race to combat Mamdani, a democratic socialist state lawmaker, while previewing a strategic reset that would bring a more personal approach to a campaign that had been criticized as distant from voters.

“The fight to save our city isn’t over,” Cuomo said. “Only 13% of New Yorkers voted in the June primary. The general election is in November and I am in it to win it.”

Critics of Mamdani’s progressive agenda, which includes higher taxes on the wealthy, have called on donors and voters to unite behind a single candidate for the November election. Instead, Cuomo joins a crowded field that also includes current Mayor Eric Adams, who is also a Democrat running as an independent. These candidates now face a complex task in cobbling together enough voters in an overwhelmingly Democratic city where Mamdani has amassed significant momentum.

In a statement, Jeffrey Lerner, a spokesperson for Mamdani, criticized Cuomo and Adams while emphasizing that the Democratic nominee “is focused on making this city more affordable for New Yorkers.”

Cuomo's decision to press on is the latest chapter in his comeback attempt, launched almost four years after he resigned as governor in 2021 following a barrage ofsexual harassmentallegations. He denied wrongdoing during the campaign, maintaining that the scandal was driven by politics.

The former governor was the presumed frontrunner for much of the primary. His juggernaut campaign drew heavily on his deep political experience, universal name recognition and a powerful fundraising operation, but at the same time limited media interviews, held few unscripted events and avoided mingling with voters.

The guarded strategy was in heavy contrast with Mamdani’s energetic run, which was centered around making the city a more affordable place to live and amassed a legion of volunteers, all while the candidate's savvy social media persona won him national acclaim.

Mamdani’s massive win sent a lightning bolt through the Democratic party, energizing young progressives but also unnerving moderates who worried the candidate’s criticisms of Israel and socialist label could alienate centrist voters.

Cuomo, in his video Monday, appeared to acknowledge his campaign’s shortcomings, splicing his latest pitch to return to the political stage with clips of him shaking hands with people and a vow to run a more grounded campaign.

“Every day I'm going to be hitting the streets meeting you where you are, to hear the good and the bad, problems and solutions,” he said, “because for the next few months it's my responsibility to earn your vote.”

Mamdani had been relatively unknown when he launched his mayoral candidacy but picked up heavy momentum before trouncing the former governor by more than 12 percentage points. Cuomo conceded the race on the night of the election.

Despite the loss, Cuomo had qualified to run on an independent ballot line in November under a party he created called “Fight and Deliver.""

Cuomo began losing support from traditional allies as he weighed whether to remain in the race, with key labor unions and political leaders starting to line up behind Mamdani. Rev. Al Sharpton, an influential Black leader, has urged Cuomo to step aside.

Some deep-pocketed contributors have meanwhile aligned behind Adams. Although he's still a Democrat, Adams pulled out of the primary shortly after a federal judge dismissed a corruption case against him at the request ofPresident Donald Trump’s Justice Department, arguing that the case had sidelined him from campaigning.

Adams, in a statement released by his campaign, said “Cuomo is wasting time and dividing voters.”

“The people spoke loudly — he lost. Yet he continues to put himself over the number one goal — beating Mamdani and securing our city future,” said Adams.

Jim Walden, a former prosecutor, is also running as an independent candidate. Curtis Sliwa, founder of the 1970s-era Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, is on the Republican line.

Cuomo's campaign released a statement later Monday that said the former governor had agreed to a proposal by Walden that “in mid-September, we will determine which candidate is strongest against Mamdani and all other candidates will stand down, rather than act as spoilers and guarantee Mamdani’s election.”

Both Adams and Sliwa have insisted they would not drop out of the race."

Adding insult to injury, I wasalso informed that blue cheesewas off the menu unless part of a recipe where it was heated to a temperature that killed bacteria.

As you might expect of any rational woman with a halfway discerning palate, I muttered: “I’d rather stick a fork in my eye.” I then looked up the risk posed by listeria infection to healthy women in the UK and found it was very low (currently around 0.23 cases per 100,000 women).

I remembered the women of Sparta who laid weedy newborns out at the Apothetae – a cave at the foot of Mount Taygetus – to test their viability in the face of the elements and thought I’m just exposing this kid to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune early. So,I continued to feaston Camembert, Roquefort, Berthaut Epoisses de Bourgogne and delectable gooey goats cheese.

I had such bad morning sickness that very few foods weren’t immediately disgorged, with the exception of sour dough, full fat dairy products and proper English orchard apples. The pregnant body is a ruthless dictator and knows what it wants to build a vital young human.

But thank heavens I’m not pregnant in the summer of 2025, as afull-scale fromage crisisthreatens our shores. It seems that an outbreak of bovine lumpy skin disease in France and Italy has led “overzealous” Defra bureaucrats to impose a temporary ban on importing any unpasteurised cheeses made in the two countries after May 23.

This means a sudden scrabble to secure cheese produced before that date or a pasteurised version, which in turn means complex paperwork, in mother tongues, that border officials seem unable to process until the product is spoilt. In turn, this means the UK’s finest delis and restaurants are running out of their most delectable, sought-after offerings, although there’s zero evidence that there’s any threat to human health.

Meanwhile, our French cousins can carry on savouring divinely-tasty unpasteurised Brie de Meaux, while yelling at us from Calais: “Let them eat Cheddar!”

I don’t think there’s been a bigger threat to the rivalrous nations’ precarious, on-off entente cordiale since the 2022 World Cup quarter-final match, when France carried the day (and poor Harry Kane missed a penalty). Personally, I can cede a footie match, but deny me my soft cheese and I might turn nasty. But what this sorry tale really illustrates is the stupendous idiocy of the bureaucrats and politicians in charge of our food policies.

We have just signed a trade deal with the US that may pave the way for all kinds of intestine-challenging gunk. Yet faced with a mouth-watering slice of Ossau-Iraty that poses no known threat to public health, British administrators are behaving like cheese-denying surrender monkeys.

There’s only one solution:we Brie-lovers of Britainmust assemble a flotilla of small boats and embark from Dover to raid the cheese counters of Dunkirk.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/local-lawmaker-proposes-bills-address-193824509.html,2025-07-14 22:30:00,Local lawmaker proposes bills to address outbreak in violent crime by youth offenders,"CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (WIVB) — Local lawmakers are sounding the alarm on what they’re calling a growing outbreak in violent crimes being committed by youthful offenders in Western New York.

On Monday, Assemblyman Patrick Chludzinski and local elected officials from the Town of Cheektowaga held a press conference to call for passage of legislation to help address the outbreak.

The push from Chludzinski comes after astolen car incident that occurred last week. According to police, three local teenagers raced through public streets and the Cheektowaga Town Park at excessive speeds. The teenagers allegedly nearly missed numerous pedestrians at the park before they crashed their car, sending one person to the hospital.

Those three juveniles were released to the custody of their parents with appearance tickets within hours of the incident.

“The outrage among residents and law-abiding citizens everywhere is palpable and understandable,” said Chludzinski. “This is a direct result of a broken system that was created by out of touch Albany politicians.”

Chludzinski is blaming the Raise the Age Law which was passed in 2019. He said it forced law enforcement to let those kids out of custody almost immediately.

One of the bills Chludzinski is proposing would prevent 16- and 17-year-olds who commit serious felonies from escaping criminal liability by their cases being transferred to family court.

“When a teenager chooses to steal a car and drive it through a public park at a high speed, that is not a youthful mistake,” said Chludzinski. “It is a criminal act and there must be consequences.”

The other proposed piece of legislation, Assembly bill A4124, would increase penalties for repeated acts of grand larceny of a motor vehicle by making these offenses eligible for bail.

“The reckless disregard youthful offenders are showing towards their neighbors and fellow residents is appalling,” said Chludzinski. “It will not be reversed by minimizing the consequences of their actions.”

The next step for Chludzinski is getting someone in the state senate to sponsor the bill. Chludzinski said he hopes to see quick action especially with the Summer bringing more people out to places like the Cheektowaga Town Park.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/union-health-now-screening-patients-231600265.html,2025-07-15 00:00:00,Union Health now screening all patients for measles,"Union Health on Monday announced it is screening every patient for measles at each visit.

All Union Health patients will be asked a series of screening questions, which will include four key questions during every visit — whether they are at Union Hospital Terre Haute, Union Hospital Clinton or any Union Medical Group facility..

The questions are:

• Are you running a fever or have a new onset of rash in the past 14-21 days?

• Do you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19 or measles?

• Any new cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pains, headache, sore throat, nausea or diarrhea, loss of taste/smell?

• Have you or someone in your household traveled out of the country within the past 21 days?

Union said measles cases are continuing to occur globally, including in Indiana and neighboring states.

This highly contagious viral illness spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes or breathes. If someone becomes infected, they may experience mild complications such as ear infections and diarrhea.

More serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis and even death. In the United States in 2025, 13% of measles cases have required hospitalization with three reported deaths.

Measles does not have an antiviral treatment; therefore, vaccinating before exposure remains the best defense against measles infection and its complications, Union said in a news release.

Measles presents initially with dry cough, fever, runny nose and red watery eyes seven to 14 days after exposure. White spots may develop in the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin, with full measles rash developing three to five days after the onset of symptoms.

If you experience the symptoms mentioned above and have been in contact with someone who has measles or have traveled to an area experiencing an outbreak, Union advises that you stay home and contact your primary care provider.

If your primary care provider recommends measles testing, they will contact the Indiana Department of Health to obtain prior authorization.

Once approved, specimen collection will be conducted at your primary care provider’s office and sent to the IDOH for analysis."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/un-says-14-million-children-000250562.html,2025-07-15 00:45:00,"14 million children did not receive a single vaccine in 2024, UN estimates","LONDON (AP) — More than 14 million children did not receive a single vaccine last year — about the same number as the year before — according to U.N. health officials. Nine countries accounted for more than half of those unprotected children.

In their annual estimate of global vaccine coverage, released Tuesday, the World Health Organization and UNICEF said about 89% of children under 1 year old got a first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine in 2024, the same as in 2023. About 85% completed the three-dose series, up from 84% in 2023.

Officials acknowledged, however, that the collapse of international aid this year will make it more difficult to reduce the number of unprotected children. In January, U.S.President Trumpwithdrewthe country from the WHO, froze nearly all humanitarian aid and later moved to close theU.S. AID Agency. And last month,Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.said it was pulling the billions of dollars the U.S.had previously pledgedto the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the group had “ignored the science.”

Kennedy, a longtimevaccine skeptic, has previously raised questions the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine — which has proven to be safe and effective after years of study and real-world use. Vaccines prevent 3.5 million to 5 million deaths a year, according to U.N. estimates.

“Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

U.N. experts said that access to vaccines remained “deeply unequal” and that conflict and humanitarian crises quickly unraveled progress; Sudan had the lowest reported coverage against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. The data showed that nine countries accounted for 52% of all children who missed out on immunizations entirely: Nigeria, India, Sudan, Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola.

WHO and UNICEF said coverage against measles rose slightly, with 76% of children worldwide receiving both vaccine doses. But experts say measles vaccine rates need to reach 95% to prevent outbreaks of the extremely contagious disease. WHO noted that 60 countries reported big measles outbreaks last year.

The U.S. is now having itsworst measles outbreakin more than three decades, while the disease has also surged acrossEurope, with 125,000 cases in 2024 — twice as many as the previous year, according to WHO.

Last week, British authorities reported a child died of measles in a Liverpool hospital. Health officials said that despite years of efforts to raise awareness, only about 84% of children in the U.K. are protected.

“It is hugely concerning, but not at all surprising, that we are continuing to see outbreaks of measles,” said Helen Bradford, a professor of children’s health at University College London. “The only way to stop measles spreading is with vaccination,” she said in a statement. “It is never too late to be vaccinated — even as an adult.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/more-14-million-children-worldwide-000210488.html,2025-07-15 01:30:00,The world has hit a ‘very stubborn glass ceiling’ on childhood vaccination,"An estimated 14.3 million children globally remain completely unvaccinated, according to a new report, and public health experts point to conflict zones as threatening childhood vaccination efforts worldwide.

Each year, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund publish a comprehensive report on estimates of national immunization coverage, based on data from 195 countries. This year’s report, released Monday, says there have been some improvements in protecting children against certain diseases through routine vaccinations.

Globally, 171,000 fewer children remained unvaccinated last year than in 2023, according to the report. But that still leaves more than 14 million children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases and an additional 5.7 million with only partial protection because they may not have gotten all the recommended doses of certain vaccine series.

“The latest estimates highlight a really concerning trajectory,” Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a news briefing.

“The global vision is for everyone everywhere to benefit from lifesaving vaccines,” she said. “But we’ve hit this very stubborn glass ceiling, and breaking through that glass to protect more children against vaccine-preventable diseases is becoming more difficult.”

Rising conflicts and war zones emerging around the world have eroded some of the progress in providing children with immunizations, she added, leading to many children remaining unvaccinated, especially in low- or middle-income countries.

“Children living in one of 26 countries affected by fragility, conflict or humanitarian emergencies are three times more likely to be unvaccinated compared to children who live in stable countries,” O’Brien said. “In fact, half of all children unvaccinated in the world live in these fragile, vulnerable and conflict countries.”

The new report says that last year, nine countries – Nigeria, India, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola – accounted for 52% of all children who have never received a dose of vaccine.

Meanwhile, mostly in high-income countries, vaccine coverage has been affected by vaccine hesitancy and distrust in institutions, leading to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases including measles and polio, said Dr. Ephrem Lemango, UNICEF’s associate director for health and global chief of immunization.

“Based on all we know, over the past 50 years,over 150 million lives were saved through vaccination, and this has been able to protect children from any forms of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Lemango said at the briefing.

“But misinformation and any forms of vaccine hesitance is a reflection of a broader lack of trust or mistrust in the systems that deliver the vaccines, in the health workers that provide the vaccines and in the manufacturing facilities or the ecosystems that manufacture the vaccines,” he said. “So it is important to see misinformation or lack of information as part of a broader ecosystem to be able to address.”

Misinformation appears to be driving outbreaks of disease in pockets of countries that tend to have high vaccination rates, O’Brien said.

“There are communities sort of hidden under that national number that have very low vaccination coverage, and that’s where outbreaks are happening, and those children are the ones who are suffering,” she said.

In the United States, a measles outbreak that originated in a part of West Texas that has a low vaccination rate continues to spread, and there have been more measles cases reported in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.

But O’Brien added that while the effects of misinformation remain concerning, they are not the main reason millions of children remain unvaccinated globally.

“The main reason, when you look worldwide, why children aren’t vaccinated is because of access to vaccines and access to vaccination services – and this is where it’s particularly important,” O’Brien said.

“They’re not being vaccinated because they don’t have access,” she said. “They’re in dangerous settings, it’s hard to gain access to them, and in some situations, the government does not have access to those environments.”

The new report comes amid growing concern about funding for global vaccination efforts. The Trump administration hasdismantled the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, which has partnered with organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to provide vaccines. And the US has announced plans to reduce funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

“We still have a lot of work to do,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news release. “Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress. WHO remains committed to working with our partners to support countries to develop local solutions and increase domestic investment to reach all children with the lifesaving power of vaccines.”

The new report says that in 2024, protection against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis remained constant, as an estimated 89% of infants globally received at least one dose of the DTP vaccine, the same share as in 2023 and 2022. Roughly 85% completed all three recommended doses of vaccine last year, compared to 84% in 2023 and 85% in 2022.

The percentage of children receiving their first dose of measles vaccine remained relatively constant last year, at 84%, compared to 83% in 2023 and 2022. But that share is lower than in 2019, when coverage was 86%, according to the new report. Overall, the report says, 20.6 million children missed their routine first dose of measles vaccine last year.

Meanwhile, the global percentage of children receiving their second dose of measles vaccine increased from 73% in 2022 and 74% in 2023 to 76% in 2024, according to the new report.

In the United States, childhood vaccine coverage has been declining, and the vast majority of measles cases this year – more than 90% – have been in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The good news is that we have managed to reach more children with life-saving vaccines. But millions of children remain without protection against preventable diseases, and that should worry us all,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the news release. “We must act now with determination to overcome barriers like shrinking health budgets, fragile health systems along with misinformation and access constraints because of conflicts. No child should die from a disease we know how to prevent.”

O’Brien said there has been “incredible improvement” in global coverage of the HPV vaccine, which helps protect against the human papillomavirus, which can cause cervical cancer and other related diseases.

The percentage of girls receiving a first dose increased to 31% in 2024, from 27% in 2023 and 20% in 2022. The percentage receiving all the doses of vaccine recommended in their country increased to 28% in 2024, from 21% in 2023 and 14% in 2022, according to the new report.

HPV vaccine coverage was somewhat stable among boys, with 8% receiving a first dose in 2024 and 2023.

“This is a real bright spot in the data that, again, year on year now, we’re seeing increases in HPV vaccine coverage,” O’Brien said, adding that recent increases are largely attributable to the introduction of the vaccine in Nigeria, Bangladesh and four other countries.

Overall, the new report shows that although there hasn’t been a significant retreat in childhood vaccine coverage globally, there hasn’t been significant improvement either, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, who was not involved in the report.

“Fourteen million children who have received no vaccines is 14 million too many. Childhood vaccination is one of the most cost-effective medical interventions that’s ever been developed,” Barouch said. “I would hope that global health authorities prioritize childhood vaccination programs and that funding mechanisms are developed to ensure the continuation of these programs.”

This time, the FDA haspulled65 cases of Boar's Head Smoked Gouda off of shelves, with the total amount approximating 780 packages. The reason for the recall has been cited as mislabeling. It's currently unclear what exactly has been mislabeled.

The cheese was produced by Alpine Slicing and Cheese Conversion Company located in Monroe, Wisconsin. The original recall date is recorded as July 2 and has yet to be classified. It's document to be a firm-initiated recall, meaning that the company decided to voluntarily remove the product from the market due to regulation or safety concerns.

The status of the recall is ongoing and there has not been an official press release issued as of yet. Boar's Head items are sold in nearly all of the major grocery stores, including Kroger, Ralphs, Safeway, Sprouts, and more.

The popular deli brandwas linkedto a listeria outbreak just last year, resulting in more than 7 million products being taken off of shelves. It was determined that one of Boar's Head's liverwurst offerings led to nine deaths and 57 hospitalizations across 18 states.

Unfortunately, recalls have become pretty frequent these days, with food products likemushrooms,bread,bakery items, andchocolatebeing removed from grocery stores. One of the most massive food recalls to date stems from the August Egg Company, after nearly 1.7 million eggs were infected with Salmonella.

Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday marked a major milestone in state’s Everglades restoration efforts — completion of a reservoir designed to hold billions of gallons of water with the goal of preventing recurrences of the toxic algae blooms that have befouled rivers in Florida.

The event, however, came as his administration continues to get hammered by environmentalists for its immigration detention center in the Everglades, which has triggered an ever-widening legal battle over “Alligator Alcatraz.”

The Caloosahatchee River reservoir, dubbed C43, can hold approximately 55 billion gallons of water with a maximum depth ranging from 15 feet to 25 feet. The reservoir captures and stores offloads from Lake Okeechobee if the water gets too high during the wet season and will provide essential water flows to the river during the dry season. The idea is to improve the health of the river and its estuary.

The four large pumps can move more than 650,000 gallons of water per minute from the Caloosahatchee River into the reservoir.

“We understand that the Everglades is home to a lot of great species, that it provides fresh water to Florida Bay, as well as clean drinking water for more than 8 million Floridians, and it supplies irrigation for the state’s agriculture. So this was something that had been neglected for too long. We needed to take the bull by the horns, and we needed to get it done,” DeSantis said during a press conference at the site.

The event came just days after the administration opened a quickly built detention center deep in the heart of the Everglades at the site of a training airport. Democrats have decried conditions at the center and environmentalists warn the facility — which at last count held nearly a 1,000 detainees — threatens harm to the “River of Grass.”

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Several groups filed a federal lawsuit and, late Monday evening, the Miccosukee Tribe of Floridaasked to intervenein the case. The tribe is concerned about the potential for harm to the Everglades, noting that there are 10 tribal villages located within a three-mile radius of the site.

The court filing argues that tribal members have routinely used land at and near the center for hunting and fishing as well as traditional ceremonies. They also fear a security risk.

The court filing insists environmental studies are needed to understand the potential harm from the center, which eventually could hold as many as 3,000 detainees.

DeSantis, however, has contended that the center — toured by President Donald Trump earlier this month — will have“zero” environmental impactand will not undo the ongoing efforts to restore the Everglades.

The governor mentioned the billions of dollars Florida has spent since he became governor to help the Everglades and prevent pollution.

Blooms of toxin-producing algae caused a death of wildlife and wreaked economic damage on the coastal communities that rely on the water for their economic activity. The glow of the blue-green algae made national headlines in 2018 and helped inform the gubernatorial debate that year. While on the stump, then-candidate DeSantis vowed to clean up the environmental mess and immediately issued anexecutive orderafter taking office in 2019 that included expediting the C43 reservoir.

He also appointed a task force to recommend solutions butnever actedon its report.

The project was completed by the South Florida Water Management District after years of  questions and delays including the statefiring its contactor.Environmental groups questioned the project because it lacked a water quality treatment facetand said algae could grow in the reservoir.

DeSantis was joined at the press conference by Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Alexis Lambert and Senate President Ben Albritton, who praised the governor for his work on expediting the dam.

“We are one step closer to being able to provide the protection for our coastal communities, making sure that our fisheries remain healthy and bountiful for those that make their living in and around the water in these communities, and it is meaningful for the future of Florida,” Albritton said, adding that the Senate “will be heavily and heartily fighting for Everglades restoration.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/nazi-document-trove-raises-questions-161739136.html,2025-07-15 19:30:00,A Nazi document trove raises questions for Argentina,"BUENOS AIRES, July 15 (Reuters) – The Supreme Court official had a secret to share when he called Eliahu Hamra, the rabbi of Argentina’s main Jewish community center, one night around the turn of the year.

The court had found a dozen boxes of Nazi documents in its basement archive containing photos of Hitler as well as thousands of red Nazi labor organization membership booklets stamped with the swastika of the Third Reich. Silvio Robles, chief of staff to the court’s president, wanted the rabbi’s advice about how to handle the discovery, Hamra recalled.

It was an uncomfortable subject for Argentina, home to Latin America’s largest Jewish community, but also notorious for giving refuge to dozens of Nazi war criminals after World War Two.

Hamra said he told Robles the court could face awkward questions about how the Nazi material came to be in its basement.

“I warned him to take into account that this could leave a stain on them,” Hamra said in an interview with Reuters.

The conversation with the rabbi was an important early step in a coordinated effort between the Supreme Court and Jewish community leaders to bring the trove of documents to light.

The find surfaced at a time when Argentina is demonstrating new readiness to look back at its complicated history with Nazis in the war era.

The IMF reaches a deal with troubled Argentina on a $20 billion bailout

President Javier Milei, who has shown a personal interest in Judaism and strong support forIsrael, in April opened up access to Nazi documents, uploading hundreds of de-classified documents online. “The Argentine government is committed to bringing these issues to light,” said Emiliano Díaz, a spokesperson for Milei’s government.

Argentina remained neutral during the conflict until March 1945 when it declared war on Germany.

After the Allied victory, many Holocaust survivors emigrated to Argentina. So did Nazi war criminals Adolf Eichmann, the chief organizer of the massacre of Jews during the Holocaust, and Josef Mengele, an Auschwitz death camp doctor who performed experiments on prisoners, granted entry by the Juan Perón government.

Even decades later, this history made the Supreme Court tread carefully around the discovery. It declined to answer written questions from Reuters on the finding or to allow the news agency to see the booklets.

The court has said it discovered the boxes during preparations for a new Supreme Court museum. But the Nazi documents had been seen sporadically in the court’s archives since the 1970s, according to interviews with three judiciary employees and a private attorney with direct knowledge of the matter.

Reuters could not determine why the trove of documents was not made public until now.

“Nazis in Argentina set in motion many feelings,” said Argentine historian Germán Friedmann.

The basement archives housed in the large stone building of Argentina’s Supreme Court contain hundreds of thousands of legal case files. It’s easy to imagine that something could get lost.

The Nazi materials were rediscovered in a room storing broken furniture, according to two judiciary officials. Robles, alerted to the find, then reached out to Hamra, the rabbi.

And on May 9, Hamra, Jonathan Karszenbaum, the director of the local Holocaust museum and himself the grandson of survivors, and Horacio Rosatti, the president of the court, gathered in a judge’s chamber to watch workers pry open the wooden crates.

“I couldn’t register even my own sensations because of the strangeness of the moment,” said Karszenbaum.

The court announced the find two days later.

It later said the discovery included 5,000 membership booklets from the German Labor Front and the German Association of Trade Unions, both Nazi labor organizations.

But some people who worked in the archives have long known about the boxes of Nazi material.

One archive employee said he saw the boxes in the same storage room about a decade ago, and caught a glimpse of booklets with German names in a partially opened box.

In the early 1970s, Alberto Garay, now an attorney and constitutional law expert in Buenos Aires, was visiting a friend who worked at the archives. He spotted a pile of red notebooks, imprinted with swastikas and bundled together with string, on the floor, he said.

“I was surprised and said, ‘what do you have here?'” Garay recalled. “He said, ‘don’t touch'”.

According to the Supreme Court, the material arrived in Argentina in 1941 aboard a Japanese vessel, part of a shipment of 83 packages from the German embassy in Tokyo. The cargo was impounded by customs agents because of concerns it could damage Argentina’s war neutrality, the court said.

But for local historian Julio Mutti, whose work focuses on Nazis in Argentina, that sounded implausible. In a May 15article, Mutti suggested the court had conflated two events that occurred a month apart: the arrival of the Japanese ship and a raid on underground Nazi organizations.

Argentina was home to about 250,000 German-speakers at the outbreak of World War Two. When Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, more than 10,000 people filled a Buenos Aires stadium to celebrate, causing alarm among locals.

In 1939, Argentina’s president dissolved the local branch of the Nazi party. Two years later, in 1941, Argentina’s congress created a commission to investigate Nazi activities in the country. When the Nan A Maru docked in Buenos Aires, the commission asked the foreign ministry to intervene, according to a Reuters review of reports in La Prensa, a popular Argentine daily at the time.

Inspectors opened five packages, finding propaganda, La Prensa reported. Searches of the remaining 78 packages revealed mostly children’s books, magazines and envelopes with war photographs. There was no mention of membership booklets.

Reuters was unable to determine what happened to the impounded cargo.

Around this time, the commission was also investigating whether the banned Nazi party and the German Labor Front were continuing to operate underground.

On July 23 – a month after the arrival of the Japanese ship – the authorities raided the offices of the German Association of Trade Unions and the Federation of German Beneficence and Cultural Clubs, fronts for the banned Nazi labor organization and party, seizing thousands of red membership booklets, according to La Prensa.

The booklets were stored in the Supreme Court, La Prensa reported.

Mutti, who learned about the raids through archival research in 2016, had searched for the notebooks in the court building, eventually concluding they had been incinerated to make space in the archive.

When news broke of the discovery of the red booklets in the basement, ”I immediately realized where they came from,” he said.

In June, the Supreme Court said it was digitizing and cataloguing the materials, and released photos of workers in masks and hairnets poring over the find.

For now, it’s unclear what the rediscovered booklets will reveal. Four historians told Reuters it’s unlikely the notebooks will yield information not already uncovered by the wartime commission.

Holger Meding, a historian at the University of Cologne, didn’t expect the booklets would radically change historians’ understanding of Nazi activities in Argentina. But, he said, “for historians, every piece of the mosaic is important.”

(WTVO) — The Jo Daviess County Health Department is warning individuals they may have come in contact with a person with a confirmed case of measles while visiting Galena last weekend.

The health department said potential exposure happened at The Country Store at Eagle Ridge Resort and Spa, at 109 Eagle Ridge Drive on Sunday, July 6th, from 8 a.m. until 10:30 a.m.

“We encourage anyone who may have been at the identified location during the exposure timeframe and are unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination status to contact their healthcare provider,” the health department said.

Only last week, state health officials announced Illinois’ recent measles outbreak was over, since no new cases had been detected since May 22nd.

State health officials on Friday announced the outbreak in April and May was contained to eight cases in the southern part of Illinois. All were connected, officials said. Two additional, unrelated cases were identified in Cook County around the same time. There was no spread beyond those two individuals until now.

Infections in Illinois emerged amid a national outbreak, with nearly 1,300 confirmed cases so far this year, including three deaths.

More than 90 percent of the cases were among people who were not vaccinated against the disease, officials said.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/shootings-lapd-rise-officers-open-220002525.html,2025-07-15 22:30:00,Shootings by LAPD on the rise as officers open fire 4 times in 2 weeks,"Los Angeles police officers have opened fire 25 times so far this year, nearly matching the total number of shooting incidents for all of 2024 in less than seven months.

After the latest incident, in which police fatally shot a man with a replica rifle in Boyle Heights on Monday, LAPD officers have shot 21 people, killing nine, according to Police Department records.

It's the highest total at this point in the year since 2018, the records show. Last year by mid-July, officers had opened fire 18 times — striking 14 people and killing eight. The year ended with 29 shootings.

The Boyle Heights shooting capped a series of four LAPD shootings in two weeks that one oversight official called a ""troubling trend.""

At Tuesday's meeting of the Board of Police Commissioners, LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell said the uptick in shootings by officers has been driven in part by increasingly combative suspects, most of whom appear to be armed.

The police shootings come even as violent crime has been dropping citywide. McDonnell said more incidents are stemming from calls for service rather than ""self-initiated"" police activity.

The chief said he asked the department's Critical Incident Review Division to analyze cases from 2025 and 2024. The internal review found an increase in the use of so-called ""intermediate force"" weapons designed to incapacitate individuals, which McDonnell called a sign that officers were trying to de-escalate violent encounters before resorting to deadly force.

McDonnell said this year's rise in shootings is linked to more people being armed with firearms or replica weapons. There were 10 such cases in all of 2024 but already seven this year, he said.

The presence of weapons — real or fake — ""makes it incredibly difficult for officers to assess the threat in the moment,"" McDonnell said.

Without offering numbers, the chief also pointed to a rise in assaults on police officers. He cited a July 5 incident in Exposition Park in which an officer sustained gunshot wounds to the legs and a graze wound to the cheek during a shoot-out with an armed suspect.

In that incident, Southwest Division gang officers had been on patrol when they noticed that a man, later identified as Ernesto Sepulveda, 26, appeared to be riding a bicycle while armed. Officers tried to detain Sepulveda, but he fled and a foot pursuit ensued, McDonnell said.

At some point during the chase, McDonnell said, the man turned and fired at officers. The suspect's gun jammed as he fled into a nearby park, where officers arrested him.

Prosecutors have since charged Sepulveda with two counts of premeditated attempted murder against a peace officer. The wounded officer is expected to make a full recovery, McDonnell said.

Another police shooting occurred on July 10, when 77th Division gang officers killed James Tullous, 63, after seeing him emerge from a car with a gun in his hand. Police learned that Tullous has been involved in an earlier confrontation that ended with him shooting at another man.

Three days later, Newton officers were called to a report of man who had stopped his car in middle of intersection and began “swinging a sword” around. When police arrived, they encountered 36-year-old Gurpreet Singh, who led them on a brief pursuit that ended in the area of Crypto.com Arena downtown.

Several bystander videos posted on social media showed Singh getting out of a vehicle encircled by police cruisers and moving toward an officer while holding a machete. The footage captured the moment when police opened fire and Singh crumbled to the ground.

LAPD shootings bottomed out with a 30-year low of 26 in 2019. The annual tally has been uneven in the years since — rising as high as 34 in 2023. Department officials say that total is far below levels seen in the 1990s.

Critics argue that, still too often, LAPD officers needlessly escalate encounters through aggressive tactics to the point where deadly force becomes necessary.

On Tuesday, the increase in shootings drew stinging criticism from some speakers at the Commission, as well as the concern of at least one commissioner, Teresa Sanchez-Gordon, who noted that the increase is coming while homicides are on pace to reach their lowest levels since the 1960s.

As of June 28, the city had recorded 116 slayings compared with 152 in the same period last year — mirroring a national trend that has seen homicide rates falling the years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I find that to be a troubling aspect of all of this,” she said.

After McDonnell promised that the department would take a hard look at each shooting, she requested that the commission be provided with reports to inform a decision on whether the incidents were in or out of policy.

LAPD guidelines say that, with few exceptions, officers may only fire their weapons when there is imminent danger of death or serious injury.

As the controversial case makes its way through court, members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, right-wing influencers and a Republican megadonor are urging the Liberal government to spare the ostriches that were exposed to bird flu.

“The Secretary has urged Canada not to kill the ostriches but to do further testing to try to better understand the virus,” a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told POLITICO.

MAGA supporters and Canada’s ""Freedom Convoy"" — whichblockaded Ottawa for weeksover Covid-19 measures — have coalesced around the cause, which they say is an example of government overreach, an erosion of institutional trust and outdated policies.

In May, Kennedyadvised Canadian officialsthat “significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment.”

Mehmet Oz, Trump’s administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, evenoffered to house the birds at his Florida ranch. Billionaire John Catsimatidis, an active member of the “save the ostriches” campaign, hasargued they ​​have life-saving antibodies.

On Tuesday, the three men sent new letters to Prime Minister Mark Carney and his government urging them to change their policy, said Universal Ostrich Farms, which owns the ostriches. POLITICO has not seen the letters.

“I know Trump is very aware of it,” Katie Pasitney, whose parents own the British Columbia farm, said Tuesday afternoon in Ottawa. “I guess we'll just see where that goes from here.”

In December, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ordered a cull at the farm after tests confirmed two ostriches were infected with bird flu. Court documents show 69 birds died in December and January after the agency declared an outbreak.

Pasitney maintains the “big, beautiful ostrich eggs” contain antibodies “that have the ability to help animal and human welfare.” If the flock is killed, the farm would close, she said.

At the Federal Court of Appeal in Ottawa on Tuesday, Universal Ostrich Farms argued that the birds should be spared because they’re not sick. The ostrich owners are appealing the dismissal of their applications for judicial review, with a decision expected in the coming days.

Umar Sheikh, the lawyer representing the owners, is arguing for exemption from Canada’s “stamping out” policy, which aligns with World Health Organization standards. The policy orders the culling of birds exposed to the avian flu to stop the spread of the contagious virus.

“[About] 400 birds remain alive without symptoms,” Sheikh said in court. “This case demonstrates how rigid policy application can produce unreasonable results, and why judicial review remains essential to the rule of law.”

In court, the CFIA argued its policy mitigates risks to animal and human health, while enabling international trade. Since 2022, more than 14 million commercial and backyard birds have been culled in Canada, including more than 8.7 million in British Columbia.

Activists have set up a commune on the British Columbia farm to protect the ostriches. They’ve sold bumper stickers to raise money for legal funds, and created memes featuring ostriches holding guns and drones.

“These are decades of personalities and animals that have been touched by the hands of our family, and they've been raised by my mom's hands, by us as kids,” Pasitney said. “They have personalities, they're loved beyond belief. There's no replacing that.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/bird-flu-remains-worry-south-214722797.html,2025-07-16 00:30:00,"Bird flu remains a worry for South Dakota poultry, dairy","PIERRE, S.D. (KELO) — The U.S. Department of Agriculture is considering vaccination plans to protect poultry and cattle, including dairy cows, from bird flu.

That’s according to South Dakota’s state veterinarian, Beth Thompson.

Arrest made after baby left in car for over 30 minutes

She briefed members of the South DakotaAnimal Industry Boardon Tuesday about national efforts to combat Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI.

Thompson said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has a draft HPAI vaccination protocol on her desk.

“I’m assuming we might be looking at vaccination by next spring,” Thompson said.

According to aUSDA website, South Dakota has seen confirmed cases of HPAI in 117 affected commercial flocks of poultry and 26 affected backyard flocks, with a total of 6,799,890 birds affected so far since the outbreak began in 2022.

A secondUSDA websitethat tracks HPAI cases in cattle shows seven dairy herds in South Dakota have been affected. AnotherUSDA websitethat tracks detections of HPAI in wild birds shows a Canada goose with HPAI was reported in Stanley County on July 3, 2025.

HPAI detections seem to rise during migrations of wild birds, according to Thompson. While HPAI was first detected in poultry flocks, she said there also is evidence that dairy cows infect poultry, too.

There have been 70 confirmed cases of HPAI in humans, including one death. No human cases have been reported in South Dakota.

“It remains a priority for USDA. It remains a foreign animal disease,” Thompson said.

South Dakota is among the 45 states participating in USDA’snational milk testing strategythat has been started because of bird flu in dairy herds, and is among the 21 states that have been provisionally unaffected. Another 20 have been unaffected.

Any non-negative results from milk testing would be reported back to her office, Thompson said.

Thompson also spoke to the board about recent USDA actions regarding the New World Screwworm, a fly that lays eggs on living animals which in turn become prey for the larvae after they hatch.

New World Screwworm had been confined in recent decades to Central America but recently was detected in southern Mexico. USDA responded by closing ports along the U.S. southern border where cattle from Mexico have been entering into the United States.

“It’s not just cattle. It’s across all species,” Thompson said. She referred to a photo she had seen showing a man whose eyeball had been eaten away by NWS larvae.

Thompson said she and her staff would work with those from other states on a plan.

Mendel Miller, the South Dakota assistant state veterinarian, recently toured one of the ports at Nogales, Arizona. He said Panama had been controlling the spread of New World Screwworm by using radiation to sexually sterilize male flies and releasing them to breed with female flies, but the population has grown too large.

“They don’t have enough sterile flies to get in front of it,” Miller said. Mexico is now building a sterilization plant, and a facility is planned for construction in Texas. The USDA said that thesterilization strategyeradicated screwworms in the U.S. during the 1960s and eliminated an outbreak in Florida in 2017.

“The biggest mortality on the cattle side is newborns,” Miller said.

Said Thompson, “We learned there are a lot of Texas animals that move up to South Dakota.”

Screwworms don’t overwinter, so any presence in South Dakota might be seasonal at most.

“I still think it’s important we protect our herds,” board member Steve Rommereim of Alcester said.

The storms ripped through homes and neighborhoods across the state and in the capital city. Since then, the road to recovery continues.

TheCommunity Development Block Grant Disaster Recoveryis a federal initiative that provides grants to cities, counties and states to rebuild disaster-impacted areas.

Little Rock Housing Director Kevin Howard says in January, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development notified the city it would be assigned $20 million to assist with disaster recovery from the March 2023 tornado.

Howard said during the Little Rock Board of Directors meeting on Tuesday night, they will present an action plan to the board to approve the plan they created to assist with unmet needs.

“What we plan to spend as far as the eligible uses is housing, infrastructure improvements, economic development, mitigation,” said Howard.

Howard explains how this could help individuals impacted get back on their feet.

“Those individuals who didn’t receive enough insurance funding to complete their house and had to come out of pocket, they had to get a loan, and they could possibly get recovery funds,” Howard said.

He says this could help recover people’s livelihoods, not only when it comes to homes but also businesses.

“If you had a business, we provide assistance there that FEMA did not provide to residents,” Howard said.

Howard says they’re aiming to support those who need it most.

“Our hope is to assist these residents in the impacted area to help them rebuild their lives,” he said.

Howard says once they get all the approval from the board, the next step would be to submit the plan to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The Syrian Ministry of Interior said in a statement on Tuesday that armed groups had resumed attacks on Syrian government forces with support from the Israeli Air Force.

Syria condemned Israel’s intervention as a violation of international law, while influential Druze Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri said in a statement that it was Syrian government troops who breached a truce announced earlier in the day.

The Israeli air attacks came after Hikmat al-Hajri urged local fighters to confront what he described as a barbaric attack from government forces.

Israel has claimed its attacks on the southern Syrian region bordering Israel are meant to protect the Druze minority, which it sees as potential allies.

In a statement shared on social media, Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli said that Israel could not “stand idly by” as the Druze engaged in fighting.

“We see massacres and insults against the Druze, and we must fight against the terrorism regime in Syria,” Chikli said, claiming it was a “grave mistake” to acknowledge Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa as the “legitimate leader” of the country.

Fighting between Bedouin tribes and local Druze fighters has reportedly killed more than 30 people and injured more than 100 since Sunday in Suwayda. Bedouin and Druze armed factions have a longstanding feud in Suwayda, with violence occasionally erupting.

United States envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said Washington was in contact with all sides “to navigate towards calm and integration”.

Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid reporting from Damascus said that the situation in Suwayda has “further escalated, with multiple Israeli drone and air strikes they claim are in support of Druze fighters”.

The latest developments come hours after Syrian Minister of Defence Murhaf Abu Qasradeclared a trucein a post on social media, saying: “To all units operating within the city of Suwayda, we declare a complete ceasefire.”

Abu Qasra’s announcement came shortly after the ministry deployed government forces tohalt the fightingbetween Bedouin tribes and local fighters. The recent fighting was the first outbreak of deadly violence in the area since fighting between members of the Druze community and security forceskilled dozens of peoplein April and May.

Syria’s Druze population numbers about 700,000, with Suwayda being home to the sect’s largest community. The Druze religious sect is a minority group that originated as a 10th-century offshoot of a branch of Shia Islam.

In Syria, the Druze primarily reside in the southern Suwayda province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south. Since the overthrow of longtimeSyrian ruler Bashar al-Assadin December, concerns have been raised over the rights and safety of minorities under the new authorities, who have also struggled to re-establish security more broadly.

In April, hundreds ofAlawite civilians were killedin apparent retribution after fighting broke out between government forces and armed groups loyal to al-Assad, who belongs to the Alawite religious sect.

Israel has launchedhundreds of air strikeson neighbouring Syria since December 2024, averaging one every three to four days.

The latest attacks come as the Netanyahu government continues to wagewar on Palestiniansin the Gaza Strip, killing at least 58,479 people since October 2023.

As well as Gaza and Syria, Israel has also launched attacks on the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Iran and Yemen in recent months."

The woman fell ill with diarrhea and abdominal pain, and was later diagnosed withGiardia, an intestinal illness commonly referred to as “beaver fever.”

Soon after the woman became sick, health officials in Hopkins County announced there was a rise in Giardia cases, with 23 confirmed cases,WSMV reported.On July 11, the Hopkins County Department of Health confirmed that therestaurantwhere the woman became sick was the source of the outbreak.

The restaurant, El Tapatio Mexican Cantina in Madisonville, had not been keeping its food at a safe temperature, according to the lawsuit.

“During an inspection at El Tapatio, environmentalists noted that the walk-in refrigerator had temperatures outside of the recommended range. The food in this refrigerator will be disposed of and the restaurant will be closed for maintenance,” county health officialssaid.

The restaurant is cooperating with the health department’s investigation, according to the statement.

Giardia is a tiny parasite that causes diarrhea and can spread easily from one person to another through food, water, surfaces or objects,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms can include nausea, diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramping or stomach pain, severe gas, bloating and dehydration, the lawsuit claims. It is also known as “beaver fever” and was noted that beavers in water could carry the parasite that leads to Giardia.

Symptoms typically begin one to two weeks after becoming infected, with Giardia lasting anywhere from two to six weeks, according to the CDC.

The lawsuit also claims Giardia infections can be fatal, and those with compromised immune systems are more likely to suffer a severe reaction and more long-term complications.

The woman filed the lawsuit for strict product liability, breach of warranty and negligence, according to the report.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/idph-taking-action-against-measels-191600180.html,2025-07-17 20:00:00,IDPH taking action against measels,"SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is taking action to prevent the national spread of measles in Illinois. A total of eight measles cases, all linked to one another, were identified in Southern Illinois in April and May.

In addition to the eight Southern Illinois cases, two additional, unrelated cases were identified in Cook County around the same time. Those did not constitute an outbreak, and there was no further indication of any additional spread beyond those two individuals.

No new Illinois cases have been diagnosed since May 22; two full incubation periods (42 days) have elapsed since the last confirmed case, allowing the Department to declare the outbreak over.

The Illinois measles cases came as the nation is facing the largest number of cases nationwide since measles was officially eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported the highest number of annual cases across the nation in 33 years — 1288 confirmed cases across 39 jurisdictions in 2025 alone.

Of the cases, 92% have affected unvaccinated individuals or individuals whose vaccination status is unknown. There have been three deaths from measles in the U.S. this year, equaling the total measles deaths nationwide between 2001 and 2024.

“The end of this outbreak, capping at just eight cases and no serious illnesses in Illinois, is a testament to the deliberate, decisive, and successful work of our public health and medical professionals,” said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. “Public health is made stronger by the power of partnership, and this measles response was a coordinated effort that included IDPH, local health departments, as well as other dedicated community and health care partners. Vaccination remains our most effective tool to prevent measles.

“I recommend that Illinois residents make sure that they and their family members are up to date on the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations,” Vohra added.

A significant contributing factor in containing or preventing outbreaks of infectious disease is immunization. According to the CDC, one dose of measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine is 93% effective against measles and two doses are 97% effective in protection from measles. Measles is easily spread through the air when someone coughs or sneezes. Measles can cause serious and long-term complications, including pneumonia and brain infections leading to long term brain and nerve damage.

Around one in five children under five years of age end up hospitalized with measles, where unvaccinated children experience severe illness or even death.

IDPH stresses the importance of ensuring everyone is up to date on immunizations. The MMR vaccine has proven to be much safer than getting natural infection. There has been no link established between autism and the MMR vaccine through multiple scientific studies both in the US and in other countries.

However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination rates in the United States have dropped, increasing the likelihood of vaccine-preventable disease spread. Individuals can protect themselves and their communities by ensuring their families are up to date on all recommended vaccines.

When the first Illinois case of measles was identified in April 2025, IDPH and involved local health departments mobilized to identify all potential sources of exposure, instruct those who were exposed and non-immune to quarantine, alert the health care community of the situation, issue news releases and social media posts to provide the public with information on ways to protect themselves, and promote preventive immunizations to help those who would have otherwise been vulnerable to contracting measles.

Among specific actions that were taken:

Local health departments rapidly identified individuals who were infected or exposed, encouraged isolation and quarantine where needed, and monitored and provided guidance to affected individuals to ensure they were receiving proper care and had taken all necessary precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.

The Franklin-Williamson Bi-County Health Department, Jackson County Health Department, and neighboring local health departments conducted vaccine outreach clinics in their communities. IDPH activated mobile vaccinations to assist with immunization efforts across the state, procuring emergency services from CIMPAR to deliver 14 mobile immunization clinics.

IDPH launched a major, strategic measles communications effort targeting zip codes with school vaccination rates for MMR below 91%. More than 2.5 million people were reached through this effort.

IDPH updated its website with easy to navigate measles information for healthcare facilities, parents, travelers and schools in addition to developing a new measles toolkit for health professionals.

IDPH expanded its laboratory capacity to conduct in-house testing for the measles vaccine strain and reduce the turnaround time relative to awaiting results from the CDC.

IDPH issued multiple health advisories, news releases, and social media posts, including an IDPH podcast episode devoted to information about measles and a Dear Colleague letter from Director Vohra addressing the department’s preparedness plans.

IDPH sent messages to more than 2,000 school administrators and school nurses statewide to alert them to the potential for measles exposures in the school setting, survey them on potential barriers to vaccination, and advise them on actions to take.

IDPH launched a measles school outbreak prediction dashboard to help local officials determine risk factors and evaluate what additional steps might be necessary.

IDPH launched a pharmacist targeted survey on the statewide inventory related to medical counter measures (post exposure prophylaxis) against measles.

IDPH engaged sister state agencies including the Departments of Children and Family Services, Healthcare and Family Services, Early Childhood, Human Services, and the State Board of Education, along with Regional Offices of Education, Head Start programs, and professional societies.

IDPH appreciates the intense level of time, dedication and resources it took to successfully mitigate such an outbreak and the critical importance of public health emergency preparedness funding in keeping Illinois residents safe."

On a day in early June, state forester Will Phifer carried a pill bottle-orange canister into a southeastern Oklahoma forest, tied it to a shaded tree trunk and left. The area was a confirmed spot for a growing population of tree-killing beetles called emerald ash borers, which likely seeped into the state from the east.

The container held what scientists hope is a solution to controlling the harmful pest: more than 100 minuscule parasitoid wasp eggs.

“These emerald ash borer eggs are laid on the outer bark of the tree,” Dieter Rudolph, forest health specialist for Oklahoma Forestry Services, said. “So, this wasp will go find them and basically inject an egg into the emerald ash borer egg.”

Instead of producing an emerald ash borer larva, the host egg will hatch a new wasp.

The emerald ash borer traveled to North Americasometime before the early 2000safter it hitched a ride from northeastern Asia. The green beetle with a metallic sheen is responsible forkilling hundreds of millionsof native ash trees by boring into their bark and feeding on nutrients.

A thinning canopy, branch dieback and D-shaped exit holes are markers of the destructive beetle.

The bug was discovered in Oklahoma in 2016 but went undetected for several years. In 2023, forestry services confirmed a large, established population of emerald ash borer in the southeastern part of the state.

“ We weren’t caught off guard, you know, we knew it was coming,” Rudolph, who leads the emerald ash borer program, said. “So, everyone has kind of been planning for this because it’s always been a ‘not if but when’ type of situation.”

The state’s 2010Forest Action Planlisted the emerald ash borer as a potential incoming threat to tree health and sustainability. Although ash species are asmall fractioncompared to the state’s majority of oak-hickory forest, Rudolph said the trees are a valuable piece of its tourism.

“If you think about where all of our state parks are, they’re usually around a lake,” he said. “These lakes have a lot of ash, and there’s the potential of, in the future – with a lot of trees dying all at once – it’s not very pleasant to look at.”

The cost of removals and safety hazards related to tree die-off could also cause economic harm, he said.

Since its detection,researchers have looked for avenuesto control the emerald ash borer’s spread. The bugs have no significant predators in the United States, aside from woodpeckers, which usually only reach the larvae once a population is high and the tree is dead. Insecticides work for individual trees, but spreading them would be labor-intensive and may exceed chemical limits in a forest.

Combating the beetles with their natural enemies, however, proved to be worth an attempt by scientists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. About four species of wasps from the emerald ash borer’s native region were selected as biocontrol agents, and the first batch wasreleased in 2007.

This is the first year Oklahoma is releasing one species of the chosen wasps, called Oobius agrili. They grow to be about the size of the sharp point of a pencil and don’t sting.

“They crawl out of that canister and they start searching,” Rudolph said. “I don’t know how bugs do the things they do – bugs are pretty cool – but they know how to find emerald ash borer eggs.”

Whether or not the wasp control will save most of the state’s ash tree population is unclear. The wasps are useful in controlling the number of emerald ash borers, but they won’t be eradicated.

More than 30 emerald ash borer-confirmed stateshave released the wasps as of 2024, and some are reporting healthy ash tree groves. Kelly Oten, extension specialist and assistant professor at North Carolina State University, has been working in the field to control the emerald ash borer since its detection in her state in 2013.

“ It’s still early on to determine the full efficacy of using biological control against emerald ash borer,” she said. “But the areas where they have been releasing the longest, there are areas where they’ve reported, ‘Hey, our trees are lasting longer, and if we were to pair this with maybe some chemical protection, some host plant resistance, then maybe we could have more full management.'”

Oten said about 0.1% of ash trees show resistance to the invasive beetle, which may be the result of a gene variation. Some scientists are consideringdeveloping a hybrid ash treecapable of surviving the effects of the emerald ash borer using that small percentage of trees. Species like the American chestnut haveundergone similar programs, and Oten said advancements in gene editing could speed up the development.

In the meantime, states are continuing to release the parasitoids before ash tree populations drop. Each wasp averages out to about $3 once it has been deployed, Oten said. A majority of funding comes from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which operates alab in Michiganthat raises the wasps before they’re sent to states like Oklahoma.

“The idea is that, ‘Hey, if this works, at some point we’ll be able to put our hands up and walk away and let them do their thing,’ Oten said. “So, it’s not something that we’ll have to do year after year, after year.”

Individual ash trees, like the ones found along city sidewalks or in backyards, can get help from arborists to treat the emerald ash borer. Those who spot D-shaped exit holes on their ash trees can alert forestry services or contact specialists. Rudolph said moving wood for purposes like camping or branch trimming can cause an outbreak.

Wood movement is the primary mode of travel for the beetles,researchers say.

“ There’s always going to be another insect,” Rudolph said. “The world got a lot smaller with how much trade is going on, and stuff is able to move across the ocean a lot easier, so there’s always going to be something else.”

“And if we’re not moving the wood, we’re just preventing one way it’s being spread.”

The CDC claimed that over eleven people in ten states have gotten sick with the same strain of Salmonella that has been linked to frozen sprouted beans. Four people have allegedly been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

So far, as of July 16, the Chetak Group has recalled the Deep brand frozen sprouted moong (mung) beans and frozen sprouted moth (mat) beans.

The CDC asks that people avoid eating any sprouted beans from the Deep brand, and to either throw them away or return for a refund. It is also recommended to wash any items or surfaces that may have come into contact with the recalled products.

Officials said that people infected with Salmonella may experience symptoms such as diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Symptoms can appear from 6 hours to up to 6 days after exposure. The illness can last up to seven days, with children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems more likely to face more severe symptoms.

Although most people infected with salmonella can recover without treatment, some may need to be hospitalized.

The observatory documented the killing of 83 Druze civilians in streets across Sweida and the surrounding countryside, for which it said Syrian government forces were responsible.

""There were bodies everywhere,"" said a volunteer working with the city's civil defence.

In another reported atrocity, three members of the Bedouin community — a woman, a child, and a man — were executed by Druze armed factions in Sweida city, the observatory said, citing video evidence.

Some 150 Druze and 261 government troops were among the dead, the observatory said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights relies on a network of sources on the ground and is generally seen as credible, though its figures cannot be independently verified.

The observatory and the state-run news agency SANA also said there was a mass exodus under way from Bedouin neighbourhoods threatened by Druze militants.

The war monitor said what began in Sweida city as local clashes has now devolved into a cycle of reprisals, sectarian fear and mass displacement.

It issued an urgent plea to Druze religious authorities to intervene, calling for an end to reprisals and protection for civilians, and warning that unchecked sectarian violence could unravel what remains of Syria's fragile social fabric.

Tribes mobilize in support of Bedouin communities

Thousands of Arab tribesmen from across Syria have mobilized toward Sweida in a dramatic show of solidarity with Bedouin communities, after armed Druze factions reportedly launched attacks on tribal villages in the area.

Mass gatherings of armed tribesmen from the countryside surrounding Damascus, as well as the cities of Homs, Hama and Daraa, were reported near key border areas with Sweida, in response to urgent appeals from Bedouin communities.

Druze factions allegedly loyal to prominent religious leader Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri reportedly launched attacks on Thursday on tribal villages in and around Sweida.

Sheikh Mohammad Al-Hassan of the Masaa'id tribe said the villages of al-Mansoura, Rajm al-Zaytoun, and parts of Shahba and Maqous were raided. He reported dozens killed, homes burned, livestock and vehicles looted, and women assaulted.

Ali Al-Jamlan, a tribal elder from Lajat, warned the violence could spiral into widespread conflict. ""These attacks will only bring ruin. Our people have been slaughtered, displaced, and robbed,"" he said, blaming the Syrian government for withdrawing the army after a temporary ceasefire.

Tribal leaders now accuse Druze militias of carrying out coordinated attacks while the military stood down, leaving Bedouin communities defenceless.

In a statement, al-Hijri denied any sectarian motives and emphasized coexistence. He condemned any individual acts of violence, stressing unity and rejecting incitement.

Meanwhile, Syria's state news agency SANA reported that ""outlaw groups"" attacked the Maqous neighborhood, committing ""massacres"" and ""field executions"" against civilians, sparking large-scale displacement.

With Sweida effectively under siege and fears of broader intercommunal warfare rising, tribal elders continue to call for de-escalation and renewed dialogue.

One elder warned, ""No foreign power can bring peace. Only mutual respect and neighbourly ties can protect this land from collapse.""

Fighting erupted in Druze-majority Sweida

Clashes between Sunni Bedouins and Druze in southern Syria have escalated sharply in recent days, centred on the Druze-majority city of Sweida.

Following the outbreak of violence in Syria's Sweida province, the Syrian government deployed troops and other security forces.

Israel then said it intervened to protect the Druze minority, carrying out airstrikes on multiple targets in Damascus on Wednesday, including within the compound of Syria's Defence Ministry.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 15 personnel from Syria's Defence and Interior Ministries were killed in Israeli airstrikes.

On Wednesday, Syrian authorities and Sheikh Yusuf al-Jarbou, the spiritual leader of the Druze community, announced a new ceasefire agreement - though it remained highly uncertain whether peace would prevail after a local leader of the Druze minority rejected the deal.

According to media reports, the government in Damascus announced it would halt all military operations under a new ceasefire agreement. A joint committee of government officials and Druze religious leaders is expected to monitor the deal's implementation.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that government troops had begun withdrawing from Sweida. Druze militias are said to have taken up positions in the city.

Even after the fighting ended, water and electricity supplies were cut off, local residents said. The local health authority said the city's hospital had to be closed due to damage, while bakeries and markets also remained shut.

In a dawn speech broadcast on national television, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Thursday reaffirmed the Druze community's place in Syrian society, underscoring the state's commitment to protecting their rights and freedoms, and warned against attempts to drag Syria into foreign agendas.

On Thursday morning, an Israeli shell hit the besieged enclave’s Holy Family Church, killing three and injuring several others, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem. Gaza has a tiny Christian community, many of whom have lived and sheltered inside the church since the outbreak of the war.

“Israel deeply regrets that a stray ammunition hit Gaza's Holy Family Church. Every innocent life lost is a tragedy,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, adding the incident was being investigated.

The strike triggered a torrent of condemnation from world leaders — including Trump, who voiced his displeasure with Netanyahu in a phone call Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said from the briefing room podium.

“It was not a positive reaction,” Leavitt said when asked how Trump had responded to the attack.

Trump “called Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning to address the strikes on that church in Gaza and I understand the prime minister agreed to put out a statement,” Leavitt said, adding Netanyahu had told Trump the attack “was a mistake by the Israelis.”

In arare criticism, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a general supporter of Israel and the Netanyahu government, also slammed Israel’s “attacks against the civilian population” as “unacceptable.”

Pope Leo XIV said he was “deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and injury caused by the military attack"" and reiterated calls for a ceasefire.

Among those injured in the strike on the church was its priest, Father Gabriel Romanelli, who received near-daily phone calls from the late Pope Francis throughout the war.

Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballaexpressed doubtthat the strike was an accident. ""What we know for sure is that a tank, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] says by mistake, but we are not sure about this. They hit the church directly,"" he told Vatican media.

Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which it launched in retaliation for Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/not-just-druze-israel-rationale-220150775.html,2025-07-17 23:00:00,Not just about the Druze: Israel’s rationale for its attacks on Syria,"On Wednesday afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video message to his country’s Druze minority. He implored them not to cross into southwestern Syria to support Syrian Druze militiamen in their fight against local Bedouin and government forces in Suwayda.

And yet, as Netanyahu made the statement, his own forces were bombing the Syrian capital Damascus, hitting the country’s Ministry of Defence, and killing at least three people.

Netanyahu claimed that he had deployed Israel’s military might in the defence of the Druze.

“My brothers, the Druze citizens of Israel, the situation in Suweyda in southwestern Syria is very serious,” the principal architect of the2018 nation-state lawthat’s been widely criticised for marginalising the Druze and other minorities said. “We are acting to save our Druze brothers and to eliminate the gangs of the regime,” he assured them, referring to the Syrian government.

Sectarian tensions betweenthe Druzeand local Bedouins in Suweyda are longstanding. Meanwhile, attempts by the newly formed Syrian government, which took power after the fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in December, to assert control over the regionhave been frustrated in part by Israel’srepeated threats against the presence of the Syrian military near its border.

There are roughly 700,000 Druze in Syria. Another 150,000 Druze live in Israel, where, at least before the 2018 law emphasising only Jewish self-determination, many regarded themselves as bound by a “blood covenant” with their Jewish neighbours since 1948 and the founding of Israel at the expense of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed inthe Nakba. While some now feel like “second-class” citizens, the majority are still supportive of the Israeli state, where they serve in the military.

“The Israeli Druze see themselves as Druze, as Israelis, and as Arabs,” Rami Zeedan, an associate professor at the University of Kansas and the founder and editor-in-chief of Druze Studies Journal, said.

“Part of the identification with Israel is the feeling of both Jews and Druze being persecuted minorities,” he added. “Israeli Druze still feel that they have much more to gain from Israel compared to any other hypothetical future. As a cornerstone of this alliance is the protection of the Druze community.”

“The Israeli Druze are now trying to use that and urge the Israeli government to protect fellow Druze in Syria,” he said, explaining, in part, the justification for Israel’s strikes on Syria, where the Druze community has traditionally been anti-Israel, even as some leaders grow closer to Israel.

But the reality is that Israel has long attacked Syria, even before the latest outbreak of violence involving the Druze in Suwayda.

Since the ousting of al-Assad after a 14-year war, Israel has struck Syria hundreds of times and invaded and occupied about 400 square kilometres (155sq miles) of its territory, excluding the western Golan Heights, which it has occupied since 1967.

Leading analysts within Israel suggest that these latest attacks may not have been entirely motivated by concern for the welfare of the Druze, so much as the personal and political aims of the Israeli government and its embattled prime minister.

“It’s pure opportunism,” Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli ambassador and consul general in New York, told Al Jazeera. “Of course, it’s nice to pretend that we’re helping our friends the Druze, in the same way as we never helped our other friends, the Kurds,” he said, referring to another regional ethnic group.

Pinkas sketched out a number of the motivations behind Israel’s recent strikes on Syria, from boosting Netanyahu’s newfound self-image as a wartime leader, to pushing back hiscorruption trial, to reinforcing the “delusion” that, over the previous 21 months, Israel has somehow managed to reshape the Middle East through military force alone.

“Lastly, he doesn’t want to see a unified Syria with a strong central government controlled by al-Sharaa,” Pinkas said. “He wants a weak central government dealing with areas controlled by the Kurds [in the north] and the Druze and Bedouin in the south.”

“Basically, if Syria remains un-unified, Israel can do what it wants in its south,” he added.

Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasised that Israel will only stand for a demilitarised Syria south of Damascus, including the region that encompasses Suwayda. This, in effect, creates a buffer zone for Israel, adding to the military reasoning for Israel’s actions in Syria.

The attacks on Syria have the additional effect of sustaining the sense of crisis that has gripped Israeli society and sustained its government through numerous scandalssince the Hamas-led attackof October 7, 2023, and the subsequent war on Gaza.

Israel has since attacked Lebanon, Iran, Yemen and Syria.

“It’s not that people are tired of war; it’s like they no longer even care. It’s ennui,” Israeli political analyst Ori Goldberg said of the public response to the latest attacks.

“War gives people energy and meaning, but it’s fleeting. People have even forgotten about the war with Iran,” he said, referring to the 12-day war in June that prompted global fears of regional escalation.

All the caveats and cautions that would normally precede military action had, Goldberg noted, been replaced by ever-fresh dangers requiring new escalations.

“It’s dangerous,” he said. “Israelis don’t care about the Druze. It’s just a new threat, a new front, and now there’s this tired, ‘OK, dude. Let’s do it [attitude]’.”

“War has hollowed us out.”"

""If you have any of these recalled products in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,"" theCDC said in a statement. Health officials also warned people not to eat, sell or serve the affected beans.

As of Wednesday, 11 people had been infected. Illnesses have been reported in 10 states and date back to products from October 2024. Four people have been hospitalized. There have been no deaths reported, the CDC said.

""The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and this outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,"" the CDC release said. ""This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for salmonella.""

The Chetak LLC Group recalled Deep Sprouted (Moth) 16 oz. and Deep Sprouted Moong 16 oz.varieties of the beans.

(WIAT) — Calhoun County Animal Control Center is temporarily closing its doors and euthanizing dogs due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus within its facility.

Calhoun County’s Facebook page released the following statement Thursday:

“Calhoun County Animal Control has confirmed an outbreak of canine distemper virus within its shelter facility. This highly contagious and potentially fatal disease affects an animal’s respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems.

After careful consultation with veterinary professionals and public health experts, the difficult decision has been made to humanely euthanize the remaining dogs currently housed at the shelter to prevent further spread of the disease to the community and surrounding animal populations.

The shelter will be closed to the public until further notice while staff work to decontaminate and disinfect the entire facility. During this closure, no intakes—whether owner surrenders or strays—can be accepted. Once the shelter is deemed safe for occupancy, operations will resume, and the public will be notified immediately.

‘This is a heartbreaking time for our staff, and the decision was not made lightly,’ said Naomi Richards for Calhoun County Animal Control. ‘Our employees are deeply affected, as they care for these animals daily. We kindly ask the community to keep our team in your thoughts and prayers as we work through this extremely difficult situation.’

Distemper is highly contagious, often fatal, and there is no cure—only supportive treatment for symptoms can be provided. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets, bodily fluids, and contaminated objects, and it is carried by wildlife such as raccoons, foxes, and skunks which can transmit the disease to dogs.

The Calhoun County Animal Control facility has been under significant strain due to growing numbers of stray and abandoned animals within the community. The Calhoun County Commission has been actively working to enhance its Animal Control operations and facilities to better meet these challenges and to protect both pets and people.

The source of the distemper outbreak is uncertain, but officials stress that stray dogs brought in off the street often have unknown medical histories. Vaccination of pets remains the strongest line of defense.

‘Vaccinating your pets not only protects them but also prevents outbreaks like this one,’ Richards emphasized. ‘We urge all pet owners to consult their veterinarian and ensure their animals are current on all core vaccines.’

We appreciate the public’s understanding and support as we work to restore a safe, healthy environment for the animals in our care and the greater community.”

A report sent out on July 17 showed that the department is projecting 137 cases for the state in 2025, which would be classified as an outbreak.

The last time cases were that high was in 2018, when there were a total of 169 cases in the state.

The department confirmed on July 16 that the first human case of the virushad been found in a Brookings County resident, and the disease has been identified in mosquito pools in Brown, Brookings, Codington, Hughes, Lincoln and Minnehaha counties.

The department recommends that people use mosquito repellent, limit the time spent outdoors from dusk to midnight and remove standing water in outdoor areas to avoid the virus.

Vietnam has this year detected 514 outbreaks in 28 out of 34 cities and provinces nationwide, the government said in a statement, adding that the authorities have culled more than 30,000 infected pigs.

""The risk of African swine fever is on a rising trend, negatively affecting the pig farming industry, food supplies and the environment,"" the government said.

African swine fever has disrupted the global pork market for years. In the worst outbreak over 2018-19, about half the domestic pig population died in China, the world's biggest producer, causing losses estimated at over $100 billion.

The recent outbreaks in Vietnam have prompted Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh to send an urgent directive to provinces and government agencies this week to deploy measures to curb the disease.

Vietnam in 2023 approved the domestic commercial use of its first home-grown African swine fever vaccines, but officials said the rate of vaccinated pigs remains low.

""Only around 30% of the pigs in my province have been vaccinated,"" said an animal health official of Quang Ngai province, where infections have been reported over the past few weeks.

""It's not clear why the rate is low - it could either be the issue of vaccine availability, efficiency or cost,"" said another provincial official, who declined to be named as the person is not authorised to speak to the media.

The agriculture ministry's Department of Animal Health didn't respond to Reuters' request for comment. Calls to AVAC Vietnam JSC, the country's main African swine fever vaccine producer, went unanswered.

AVAC said last month it had sold 3 million vaccine doses in the domestic market and exported 600,000 doses to the Philippines and Indonesia.

AsThe Winnipeg Sun reported, Taylor is a geography student at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus, and the cartography and map-making classes she takes as part of her degree provided her with the necessary tools to build an interactive wildfire tracking website.

After the Canadian government issued a state of emergency for Manitoba, where her family lives, they, along with thousands of other residents, fled their homes as the fires crept dangerously close. It was an anxiety-inducing situation, but Taylor realized her knowledge of geography could come in handy and potentially save lives.

She gathered data on the fires from NASA databases and Canadian government sites to create the wildfire map, which ""includes time-lapse visualizations of the fires, as well as wind and air-quality forecasts,"" per the Sun. Additionally, it listsnonprofits and volunteer organizationswhere the public can donate to those affected by the fires.

The newspaper reported that, as of June, the wildfires displaced over 17,000 people, including 5,000 in Taylor's hometown of Flin Flon. Just 13 miles southwest in Denare Beach, Saskatchewan — one of the most affected areas — 200 people lost their homes.

According to theWinnipeg Free Press, the 2025 wildfire season in Canada is expected to be the second-worst on record. Experts attribute the rapid spread of fires over the last few weeks to higher-than-average temperatures and dry conditions.

Wildfires have burned nearly 10 million acres of land so far, and the risk of further fire outbreaks is high due to a warmer-than-usual summer and the expectation of little rainfall, according tothe CBC.

Rising global temperatures, resulting from the burning of dirty fuels such as oil and gas, are contributing tomore extreme weather events, including wildfires, worldwide.

For example, in 2023, Canada experienced its most destructive wildfire season on record, with more than 40 million acres burned — nearly seven times the historical average, according tothe Canadian Climate Institute.

Astudy by World Weather Attributionfound that the changing climate increased the likelihood of extreme fire conditions in Eastern Canada during the 2023 season, and made the cumulative severity 50% more intense.

""In a way, it's hard because I wish I didn't have to make this project,"" she told the newspaper.

This marks the first such death in this region in 18 years. But it's a stark reminder that this historic disease, though rare nowadays, is not just a disease of the past.

So what actually is ""plague""? And is it any cause for concern in Australia?

Related:Why Does The Plague Keep Coming Back to Plague Humans?

The word ""plague"" is often used to refer to any major diseaseepidemicorpandemic, or even to other undesirable events, such as a mouse plague. Naturally, the word can evoke fear.

But scientifically speaking, plague is a disease caused by the bacteriumYersinia pestis.

Plague has three main forms: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.

Bubonic is the most common and is named after ""buboes"", which are the painful, swollen lymph nodes the infection causes. Other symptoms includefever, headache, chills and weakness.

Bubonic plague istypically spread by fleasliving on animals such as rats, prairie dogs and marmots. If an infected flea moves from their animal host to bite a human, this can cause an infection.

People can also become infected through handling an animal infected with the disease.

Septicemic plagueoccurs if bubonic plague is left untreated, or it can occur directly if the disease enters the bloodstream. Septicemic plague causes bleeding into the organs. The name comes from septicemia, which refers to a serious blood infection.

The recent death in the United States was due to a case of pneumonic plague, which is the most severe form. Bubonic plague can in some cases spread to the lungs, where it becomes pneumonic plague. However, pneumonic plague can also spread from person to personvia tiny respiratory droplets, in a similar way to COVID. Symptoms are similar to the other forms but also include severepneumonia.

Some30–60% of peoplewho contract bubonic plague will die, while the fatality rate can be up to 100% for pneumonic plague if left untreated.

This disease is one of the most important in history. ThePlague of Justinian(541–750CE) killedtens of millions of peoplein the western Mediterranean, heavily impacting the expansion of the Byzantine Empire.

The medieval Black Death (1346–53) was also seismic, killingtens of millions of peopleandup to half of Europe's population.

Spread by the growing trade networks of the British empire, the third and most recent plague pandemic spanned the years 1855 until roughly 1960, peaking in the early 1900s. It was responsible for12 million deaths,primarily in India, and evenreached Australia.

It's believed the bubonic plague was largely behind these pandemics.

First introduced into the US during the third pandemic, plague infects an average ofseven people a yearin the west of the country, due to being endemic in groundhog and prairie dog populations there. The last major outbreak was100 years ago.

Deaths are very rare, with14 deaths in the past 25 yearsin the US.

Globally, there have beena few thousand casesof plague over the past decade.

Thecountries with the most cases currentlyinclude the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru, with cases also occurring in India, central Asia and the US. Cases usually occur in rural and agricultural areas.

Plague can easily be treated with common antibiotics, typically a course of 10–14 days, which can include both oral and intravenous antibiotics. But itmust be treated quickly.

The recent death is concerning, as it involvesthe airborne pneumonic formof the disease, the only form that spreads easily from person to person. But there's no evidence of further spread of the disease within the US at this stage.

AsY. pestisis not found in Australian animals, there is little risk here. Plague has not been reported in Australiain more than a century.

But plague, like many diseases, is influenced by environmental conditions. The risk ofclimate changecausing an expansion in thehabitat of animal hostsmeans public health experts around the world should continue to monitor it closely.

The plague, though often perceived as a disease of history, is still with us and can pose a major health threat if not treated early.

Yo-Yo Dieting May Trigger Long-Lasting Changes in Gut Bacteria

11 Everyday Items That We Forget Are Nasty Hotspots For Bacteria"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-china-discover-alarming-amount-170006630.html,2025-07-18 23:00:00,Scientists in China Discover an Alarming Amount of Pandemic-Causing Viruses,"Scientists in China have discovered 22 potentially pandemic-causing viruses never before detected in nature — including two that are genetically similar to horrifying contagions notorious for killing humans, sources say.

The spine-chilling finds were made by researchers studying kidneys collected from colonies of bats in the nation’s Yunnan province between 2017 and 2021 — an alarming development given that the flying mammals were roosting near fruit orchards that neighbor suburban towns.

“These viruses are particularly concerning … raising alarm about potential human exposure via contaminated fruits or water,” molecular virologist professorVinod Balasubramaniamof Australia’s Monash University says in a statement cited byNewsweek.

It is unknown if human exposure to the new viruses would actually result in infections. But bats have been blamed in the past for introducing several catastrophe-causing bugs to humanity — including Ebola, SARS, MERS and COVID-19.

“The danger to humans is considerable,” Manhattan internistDr. Stuart Fischertells theNational Enquirer. “These viruses have the potential to jump from bats to humans. They can get inside our bodies and develop a resistance to our natural immune responses. Essentially, the virus can learn to outsmart our immune system.”

Among the newly discovered bugs were two henipaviruses that are as much as 57 percent genetically similar to the deadly bat-borne Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, which have killed people in Australia and Southeast Asia since their emergence was discovered in the 1990s.

The Nipah virus, in particular, is much feared, according to sources, after a 1998 outbreak in Malaysia that wiped out 105 folks and infected 265. The disease, experts say, has no known treatment and a frightening fatality rate as high as 75 percent.

“The dust has not yet settled on the COVID-19 fiasco,” adds Fischer, author of the acclaimed bookThe Little Book of Big Medical Emergencies. “Look at how woefully unprepared humanity was for that virus.

According to a press releasefrom the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, a ""gastrointestinal illness outbreak"" occurred on the Navigator of the Seas that traveled round-trip to Mexico from Los Angeles between July 4 and11.

Out of the 3,914 passengers, 134 reported being ill, as did seven crew members. The victims experienced symptoms that included abdominal cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, but the CDC reports that the ""causative agent"" has not been determined.

The ship's crew took preemptive measures for passengers by isolating sick and then collected stool specimens from them for testing. Cleaning and disinfection procedures were also implemented and the CDC notified.

Statistics from the Vessel Sanitation Program show 18 bouts of gastrointestinal illness aboard cruise ships under the program's authority in, whichties for the total amountin all of 2024.

There were only 14in all of 2023, but aCDC spokesperson told USA Todayin April that although ""the number of recent cruise ship outbreaks has been higher than in years prior to the pandemic, we do not yet know if this represents a new trend."""

After the COVID-19 outbreak began, the internet seemed to offer the thinnest of silver linings. Zoom kept kids in class,sort of. Celebrations—birthday parties, anniversaries—involved “socializing” in multiplayer games. Tech companies built applications for contact tracing to help forecast the pandemic’s spread. The industry eagerly welcomed its novel reputation as a portal to normalcy, for those who could access these opportunities. “The world has faced pandemics before,” Mark Zuckerbergwrotein a column forThe Washington Postin April 2020, “but this time we have a new superpower: the ability to gather and share data for good.”

The filmEddington, now in theaters, gleefully rebukes Zuckerberg’s assertion. Written and directed by Ari Aster—the filmmaker behindHereditary,Midsommar, andBeau Is Afraid—the neo-Western thriller is set during the early days of COVID’s spread in the United States. But rather than explore the impact of the coronavirus, the movie studies the misinformation, paranoia, and outrage that grew amid the internet’s dominance during social isolation. The small town of Eddington, New Mexico, becomes a literal battleground for its locals; they are overcome with the fear fomented by what they’ve seen on their screens. The movie is nasty and cynical—and also eerily accurate in its rendering of the digital reality of pandemic life.Eddingtoncaptures what happens when a community can’t log off: people becoming stupefied by the illusion of connection, and muting logic in the process.

Eddingtonisn’t the first film to take advantage of virtual world-building by incorporating social-media feeds and messaging apps into its visuals. But it does so in a way that makes the online world feel like it’s bleeding into the characters’ daily lives. Joe (played by Joaquin Phoenix), the town’s sheriff, is introduced via a video he’s watching on his phone; the YouTube page fills the frame until the camera zooms out to reveal him as the viewer. His conspiracy-theorist mother-in-law prints out “news” articles that she believes prove her points, reads them out loud, and chatters away about what she’s convinced Joe and his wife, Louise (Emma Stone), refuse to see. While running for mayor against the incumbent, Ted (Pedro Pascal), Joe blares his speeches over his police vehicle’s loudspeaker, creating a chaotic soundscape evoking a crisis-driven news feed.

[Read: Why Ari Aster freaks people out]

Among all this incessant noise are people whose digital personas dramatically contrast with who they are offline: Ted and his teenage son can barely stand each other, but in a campaign ad, they embrace warmly. Joe is celebrated on Facebook after defending a man who refused to wear a mask in a grocery store, but a rally attracts just a handful of supporters. Louise becomes obsessed with Vernon (Austin Butler), an influencer with a cultlike following, and disappears for long stretches of time, but Joe doesn’t register her fixation until he spots a comment she left under one of Vernon’s videos. Dread permeatesEddington: When Joe and his deputies watch a clip of an attack on a police precinct instigated by militant protesters, they never check the provenance of the footage; they just begin to arm themselves.

Research hasshownthat spending time on social media isn’t necessarily bad; users can generate a sense of kinship by actively participating in discussions and offering feedback and support. But that finding seemed to hold more weight prior to 2020, when the internet existed in tandem with people’s fuller lives. For the characters inEddington, as it was for many of us living in America that year, there is nowhere to turn to but the conspiratorial thinking, heated debates, and endless updates online.

At one point, Joe barrels through a crowd of people chanting social-justice slogans while brandishing a ring light like it’s a weapon—an absurd image that conveys the disconnect between his actual and digital lives. Joe is a meek man: He struggles to express himself to his wife, who prefers not to be touched by him; he’s desperately outmatched in the mayoral race by the popular Ted; and only his two deputies seem to respect his authority as sheriff. For him, the emergency becomes an opportunity to project a more confident version of himself online. Yet in his quest to become Eddington’s most admired townsperson, Joe ends up trapped in a nightmare of his own making. “Is this what I’m supposed to do?” he cries when violence breaks out. Nobody answers, because nobody knows; his reality has become a void.

[Read: The year that changed the internet]

Joe’s despair reminded me ofa conversationmy colleague Charlie Warzel had with the writer and technology theorist L. M. Sacasas in 2022. They’d discussed why being on the internet can make people feel stuck in a loop of doom and confusion. Sacasas explained that the present is never the point of social-media engagement—that posting requires being reactive, thereby turning social-media users into the perfect vessels for propagating conflict. “What we’re focused on is not the particular event or movement before us, but the one right behind us,” Sacasas said then. “As we layer on these events, it becomes difficult for anything to break through.” Information, as a result, becomes abstracted into tangents. “We’re caking layers of commentary over the event itself,” Sacasas added, “and the event fades.”

InEddington, COVID becomes a mere footnote to the events unfolding throughout the town—Joe doesn’t even check his test results when he starts exhibiting symptoms. What he continually responds to instead is the stress built up as a result of the pandemic; he’s left playing catchup to scuffles happening around Eddington, unraveling emotionally as the days pass. The film never interrogates why the early pandemic led to so many ideological conflicts, but it suggests that the prognosis is bleak for those who continue to venture too far into the internet’s noxious rabbit holes. Being too online, in other words, can be its own kind of sickness.

There’ll be more to celebrate next week as Catholic Heart Workcamp will build a work counter in Brothers Keeper’s food pantry in First English Lutheran Church on Locust Street as part of a large-scale mission project in the city.

Alderwoman Margaret Lupo, a board member for Brothers Keeper, said all those helped by the food pantry and clothing closet are welcome to share cake and lemonade at the church at 12:30 p.m. on Saturday.

“It’s a celebration for the people we work with,” she said. “The beauty of the Brothers Keeper Outreach is many denominations working together.”

The organization operates on donations, said Kris Clark, a board member for Brothers Keeper. This includes partnerships with retailers and churches from Amherst, Lockport, and North Tonawanda.

Clark said that on Friday, the organization helped 17 families, serving 58 people. Brothers Keeper is open on the first and third Thursdays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to noon.

Checking the pantry’s refrigerators, Clark found fresh spinach, carrots, eggs, and hot dogs in stock. Canned foods, cereal, pasta, baked items, deodorant, toothpaste and other hygiene products are also available, she said.

Lupo said she got involved with the charity during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.

“I went and said I wanted to help feed people,” she said. “This is just a wonderful opportunity for community service and the people who benefit.”

Lupo said Brothers Keeper will be the beneficiary of that same giving spirit from Catholic Heart Workcamp, based in Niagara Falls. Volunteers will clean out the clothing room at Brothers Keeper, Lupo said, and build the new counter.

“We need young people to help with heavy lifting,” she said.

According to manager Tim Kozyra, Catholic Heart Workcamp is a missionary organization that provides short-term mission trips for Catholic youth groups to perform service projects for those in need.

This year, Kozyra said 14 youth groups from Wisconsin, New Jersey, Michigan, and Massachusetts will bring nearly 400 volunteers to stay at a Niagara University dormitory next week to provide free services to properties in the city, Sanborn, Lewiston, Ransomville, and the Town of Niagara. Volunteers are ages 13 to 22 who raise funds to pay for participating in the workcamp, Kozyra said.

“They come wanting to change the world,” he said. “Because of the work they do for others, and the feelings they get, they come away absolutely changed themselves. We see kids constantly here because their parents told them to come, and they cry when they have to leave. It’s very touching.”

Workcamp projects target neighborhoods and individuals who often have no other means for addressing repairs and small building projects.

“The general rule is anyone who is disabled, elderly, a single mother, who is in need of help and financially unable to get it on their own — that is mostly who we focus on,” Kozyra said. “In Lockport, we picked out a small area that is more economically in need than others. We went around and knocked on doors and said, ‘We see your porch is in need. Can we replace a few boards and paint it?”

This helped workcamp leaders schedule projects Monday through Thursday on Walnut, Genesee, Lagrange, and Clinton streets, as well as Harvey Avenue, he said.

“We’re doing five wheelchair ramps, plus probably another five that we’re re-staining or doing repair work,” Kozyra said. “A lot of painting, and a lot of yard work.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)confirmedthe outbreak is still under investigation, with illnesses reported in 10 states. Fortunately, no deaths have been reported so far connected to the bad batch of beans.

Chetak LLC distributes thefrozen sprouted moong and moth beans.

On July 16, the company issued a voluntary recall of the products, which were sold in 16-ounce packages under the“Deep”label, with a range of lot codes printed on the back of each bag.

Health officials are now urging anyone with these beans in their freezer to toss them immediately or return them to the store for a refund.

Salmonella is a relatively common, but potentially very serious, foodborne illness. While most healthy adultsrecoverwithin a week if exposed, the infection can cause some very dangerous complications in young children, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems, per the CDC.

Symptoms include high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and signs of dehydration like dizziness or dry mouth. If symptoms persist for longer than three days or worsen, health experts recommend consulting a doctor immediately.

The outbreak hasn’t been tied to any specific state or region as of press time, but health departments in several states are now assisting in the CDC’s investigation into the frozen beans.

Public health officials also told consumers to thoroughly wash any surfaces, dishes, or utensils that may have come into contact with the recalled beans.

Additionally, any businesses that may be affected should remain on high alert. The CDC has instructed restaurants, grocery stores, and other food service providers to remove the products immediately and sanitize any affected areas.

The full list of recalled lot codes and more information on impacted food products can be found on the FDA’s official website."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/more-130-passengers-fall-ill-195336955.html,2025-07-18 23:15:00,More than 130 passengers fall ill on Royal Caribbean cruise,"(CNN)– More than 130 cruise ship passengers reported suffering from a gastrointestinal disease after setting sail from Los Angeles on July 4. The cause of the outbreak has not been determined.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 134 passengers on Royal Caribbean’s Navigator of the Seas — or 3.4 percent of the cruise’s total passenger list of 3,900 people — reported feeling ill. Seven members of the crew were also affected, out of a total of 1,266 staff members.

The outbreak was reported to the CDC’s Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) on July 11 when the weeklong Royal Caribbean cruise returned to Los Angeles to dock after the trip was over.

According to records compiled by the VSP, there have been 18 outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness on cruise ships under the program’s jurisdiction so far this year, mainly related to Norovirus.

That’s the same number of outbreaks reported all of last year, according to incidents logged by the CDC.

While it’s unclear what caused the outbreak on the Royal Caribbean ship, passengers experienced diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal cramps, the CDC said in a post this week about the Navigator of the Seas outbreak.

In April, about 250 passengerson the Queen Mary 2reported coming down with the highly contagious norovirus.

That disease has a reputation as “the cruise ship virus,” infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center,told CNN Travelearlier this year.

That’s because it spreads easily, and anyone in close quarters — like cruise ships — is extra susceptible. Such outbreaks also frequently occur in schools and jails — wherever large groups of people gather in tight spaces.

But the CDC hasn’t determined yet if the culprit on the Navigator of the Seas was norovirus.

“The health and safety of our guests, crew, and the communities we visit are our top priority,” a Royal Caribbean Group spokesperson told CNN Travel. “To maintain an environment that supports the highest levels of health and safety onboard our ships, we implement rigorous cleaning procedures, many of which far exceed public health guidelines.”

The CDC says Royal Caribbean reported boosting its cleaning and disinfection procedures and also collected specimens from infected passengers, after isolating anyone who was ill.

CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen said that while infectious diseases can be “very unpleasant,” they typically “pass within 1 to 2 days.”

While the cause remains unknown in this case, Dr. Wen reiterated that precautions such as thorough hand washing are critical. She also noted that norovirus is not killed by alcohol-based hand sanitizers that are commonly used.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/distemper-outbreak-forces-euthanization-234700457.html,2025-07-19 00:30:00,Distemper outbreak forces euthanization,"ANNISTON — Due to an outbreak of the canine distemper virus, Calhoun County Animal Control has temporarily closed its facility and euthanized 82 dogs. This contagious and often fatal disease affects an animal's respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems, Calhoun County Animal Control stated in a recent release.

Officials made the decision to euthanize the dogs at the shelter after consulting with veterinary professionals and public health experts. This measure was deemed necessary due to the severe nature of the outbreak and the highly contagious nature of distemper, aiming to prevent further spread of the disease to the community and surrounding animal populations.

The shelter will remain closed to the public until further notice for decontamination and disinfection, the release stated. During this period, no animals, including owner surrenders or strays, can be accepted for intake. The public will be notified immediately when the shelter is deemed safe to reopen.

""This is a heartbreaking time for our staff, and the decision was not made lightly,"" said Naomi Richards, a representative for Calhoun County Animal Control. ""Our employees are deeply affected, as they care for these animals daily. We kindly ask the community to keep our team in your thoughts and prayers as we work through this extremely difficult situation.""

Canine distemper is a “highly contagious” disease with no known cure, only supportive care for symptoms, the release stated. It poses a particular threat to puppies under four months old and unvaccinated dogs. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets, bodily fluids and contaminated objects. Wild animals like raccoons, foxes and skunks can also carry and transmit the disease to dogs.

Calhoun County Commissioner Caroline Henderson expressed her disdain with the situation, stating, “I hate this.”

“You never know when you take or pick up an animal if it has distemper,” Henderson said. “It doesn’t show and the animals must be put in the kennels. This will always happen but we must maintain an animal control shelter.”

The Calhoun County Animal Control facility faces growing strain from an increase in stray and abandoned animals, according to the release. In response, the Calhoun County Commission is actively working to enhance its Animal Control operations and facilities, aiming to better manage these issues and safeguard both animals and the public, the release stated.

Officials say the distemper outbreak's exact source is unknown, but they highlighted that stray dogs entering the shelter frequently have undocumented medical histories. The most effective protection against the virus is vaccination. Puppies require a series of vaccinations beginning at 6-8 weeks of age, followed by boosters throughout their lives.

""Vaccinating your pets not only protects them but also prevents outbreaks like this one,"" Richards said. ""We urge all pet owners to consult their veterinarian and ensure their animals are current on all core vaccines."""
https://www.yahoo.com/news/el-paso-officials-urge-families-004005633.html,2025-07-19 03:15:00,El Paso officials urge families to vaccinate kids ahead of 1st day of school,"EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — As families prepare for the first day of school, El Paso health officials are reminding parents that updated vaccinations are a must, with several required by the State of Texas before students can step into the classroom.

Texas law requires students to be vaccinated against several illnesses including:

DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis)

Polio

Hepatitis A and B

Varicella (chickenpox)

MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella)

While most of these vaccines are routine, officials say one in particular — the MMR shot — is getting more attention this year because of the recent outbreaks nationwide.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this year’s measles outbreak is the worst that the U.S. has seen in decades.

El Paso County has reported63 measles casesas of July 18, with adults making up the majority of those infected. Children under 5 years old are the second most impacted group.

“The concern is still out there,” said Ivan Luna, director of Immunize El Paso. “We have parents calling in asking for that MMR vaccine. It’s important to stay protected.”

Despite the rising numbers, Luna said El Paso continues to be one of the most highly vaccinated communities in the state.

“El Paso is a community that highly trusts vaccines,” he said. “Our rates are pretty high compared to other cities in Texas.”

Immunize El Paso offers all required school vaccines on a walk-in basis with no appointments needed. The organization will also host a community clinic at Fabens High School from from 1 to 4 p.m. Thursday, July 25.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-maga-hates-science-much-130007079.html,2025-07-19 13:30:00,Why MAGA hates science so much,"Against all the evidence of horrific, devastating weather around us,climate changeis still a “hoax.” Ameaslesoutbreak sparked byanti-vaccineconspiracy theoristsnow extends beyondTexasto 34 states. Republicans are doing all they can to shut down funding for medical research.

Why doesMAGAhatescience? Shall we count the ways?

Because scientific advances don’t discriminate between the “worthy” and those considered unworthy, and because some in the billionaire class think they deserve to live much longer than you do.

As they prep their fancy-shmancy bunkers ordelude themselves that they can one day head off to Marsto escape their wanton destruction of the Earth, the billionaire bros know they can avail themselves and their children of lifesaving vaccinations and other health care services that they are putting out of reach for many of us.

But it’s not just the small — and small-minded, and small-hearted — wealthy libertarian or right-wing elite. Working people who choose to wear MAGA red caps hate science for their own reasons: It tells them things about disease and environmental destruction and, say, women’s reproductive health that they cannot bear to face. Scientific findings often do not jibe with their religious beliefs. If you believe the Earth is 6,000 years old and were never taught how to distinguish between faith and knowledge, you’re naturally going to have a testy relationship with science.

By its nature of openness to new ideas, scientific inquiry exemplifies the secular worldview of liberals. Science levels the playing field. It’s woke. Scientists discriminate about the significance of evidence, but they do not discriminate about the significance of different human beings. (That is what the MAGA faithful think their religion is for — because Republicans have spent a long timeperverting Christianity, too, to justify their greed and bigotry.)

From reading the writers of the Enlightenment, Thomas Jefferson knew science was evening out the social playing field. Inan article for Smithsonian magazine, historian Stephen E. Ambrose notes that amid all the contradictions of his personal life, Jefferson never relinquished his idealism about all men being created equal:

In his last message to America, on June 24, 1826, ten days before he died on July 4 (the same day that John Adams died), Jefferson declined an invitation to be in Washington for the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. He wrote, “All eyes are opened, or opening to the rights of man. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them.”

There’s the danger to those who consider themselves superior — by race, color, creed or position on the Forbes annual list of billionaires — to the mass of men and women. Scientific advancements make us ever more aware that we are all the same and should enjoy the same basic rights to education, health care, civil liberties like voting, freedom of and freedomfromreligion, and the freedom to read or otherwise consume whatever opinions or cultural works we choose — the very things that the current occupant of the White House and his MAGA followers are working to take away from us.

Beyond the historical friction between science and religious beliefs (for which earlier scientists could be imprisoned or burned at the stake), the main reason MAGA hates science is human-caused global climate change. Al Gore famously called global warming an “inconvenient truth,” butDonald Trumppersists in calling it “a hoax,” while defunding climate research, green technology, NOAA and FEMA. The COVID pandemic gave MAGA followers many more incoherent reasons to distrust science, while watching “their favorite president” politicize every aspect of the response.

Apparently, millions would rather suffer mightily — or even die, asmany willfully unvaccinated people did— than admit they were wrong. It’s a sad aspect of human nature to feel we have such sunk costs in our often-wrongheaded opinions that we are willing to perish for them.

I was a biology major in college for a few years, with vague plans of medical school, vaguely until I switched to journalism. I would not pretend to be a scientist based on that curtailed education, but I did spend 36 years in medical publishing. As a production editor and later as a submission systems manager, I came to understand the significant work of researchers and the selfless work of the many peer reviewers who help editors determine which studies merit publication. For many journals I worked with, the acceptance rates were astonishingly small.

MAGA conspiracy heads might call that publication process elitist, and claim that people with worthwhile ideas are being kept out of the conversation. Most people in the sciences, however, understand the process as separating the wheat from the chaff by culling out the many papers that for one reason or another — perhaps poor design or insignificant findings — fail to advance scientific knowledge.

But you don’t need any understanding of science to understand that what Trump and his party of grifters and religious zealots are doing to universities by withholding research funding will be economically devastating to this country, slowing scientific progress andseriously disrupting the lives and careersof many researchers, technicians, lab assistants and students.

The long-term negative effects of Trump’s attack on science, which are also part of the full-spectrum MAGA assault on education and the nonpartisan civil service, will likely be even worse. Students will be increasingly reluctant to pursue careers in science. Only a months ago, STEM courses in high school and college were viewed as critical to the future of American ingenuity and enterprise, a big part of what actually made America great. It’s impossible to gauge just how much damage will be done as we ban vaccines, deny climate science and make measles great again.

Many MAGA supporters don’t want to share “their” America with brown people who may or may not be citizens; too many of them welcome the persecution and deportation of longtime U.S. residents who put in long hours at child care centers, hotels and restaurants, construction and landscaping companies, hospitals and nursing homes, and in agricultural fields, doing the thankless and often grueling work of picking and delivering the crops that feed the nation.

Britain’s decision to leave the European Union — one of the worst self-inflicted wounds of recent political history —has cost the U.K. an estimated 6% drop in GDPso far. The probable result of MAGA’s lust to spend billions on hiringmore masked, secret police-style ICE agentsto deporthard-working, tax-paying immigrants, even if we look beyond the human suffering, will be a Brexit-level recession on steroids.

Ultimately, what our felonious, ever-grifting president wants to do is to destroy all expertise in this country. That’s what autocrats do. The manchild MAGA leader can’t stand for any so-called experts to question him when he makesidiotic suggestionsabout public health proposes setting off nuclear bombs inside a hurricane or tries tochange the longstanding name of a geographical featureto gratify his fragile ego. He wants to claim that his supposedly big and beautiful bill is the most popular legislation in history and that he’s the greatest president ever, and doesn’t want to hear egghead historianstell him otherwise.

Trump hates to be questioned — so he hates journalists, scientists and anyone else with the kind of education that encourages critical thinking. That’s why he has surrounded himself with an entire Cabinet ofwhite nationalist frat boys,shameless sycophantsand fellow grifters — not to mention a supermajority ofright-wing Supreme Court justiceswho appear ready to hand him absolute power.

“American Robin,” a poem by Barbara Crooker that was recently featured in George Bilgere’s “Poetry Town” newsletter, is about our inability to respond appropriately to the devastation of human-made climate change. But it applies equally well to all the anti-science, misogynist, racist, Dark Enlightenment nonsense coming from the right that seeks to rob you, your children and your grandchildren of a financially andenvironmentally secure future. It begins this way:

Here’s that bird again, launching from the rhododendron,banging his forehead on my living room window.Thump.Thump.Does he see his own reflection in the glassor does he see a rival, a threat to his nest? I hanga black raptor silhouette in the middle square,but that does not deter him.Knock yourself out,I keep thinking. Next, I try cardboard, then a sheetof newspaper smeared with its terriblenews. He comes back. Do I admirehim for his persistence or shrugat his stupidity?Thunk. Thunk.

Read the wholepoem;I’ll wait.One could read Crooker’s dismay at the American robin’sthumpsandthunksagainst her windowpane as a rhyme for the name of a certain infamous conman turned populist demagogue. But that is perhaps unfair — to the poet and the bird.

Mitschelen, from Etna Green, is a 10-year 4-H member now in his last year. He’s one of around 200 poultry club members who brought 700 birds to the fair this year, according to organizational leader Valarie Jacobs.

Poultry exhibition classes and showmanship Friday morning were the first 4-H activities of the nine-day fair.

“This is the exhibition show. As I like to say, a lot of us members, it’s like the fancy birds,” Mitschelen said while waiting in line for judging, a bird under each arm. “Not necessarily meat production, they’re breeding stock.”

The judge, Tim Calloway, took the measure of each bird as he went down the table, picking them up and inspecting feathers, feet and faces. Mitschelen said he was comparing them to the standards laid out by the American Poultry Association.

“Right now, this is a standard class. The judge goes through the birds and says, ‘Keep these, we’ll bring them back.’ That’s what we’re doing now. Right now we’re going through the honors and seeing, all right, who’s going to be the best standard bird,” he said. “They’re looking for specific characteristics and qualities. That could be size, that could be color, the type of comb on them. That’s all decided through a bunch of people on a national level to keep the standards up.”

Jacobs said the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza earlier this year had passed well before the start of fair week. The state declared avian flu-free status at the end of May.

Outbreaks of avian influenza were found in 27 commercial bird populations in several Indiana counties, prompting the killing of tens of thousands of animals and the destruction of millions of eggs. Nearly 6,000 ducks were depopulated in Elkhart County after H5N1 was found at two commercial breeders in February.

Jacobs recalled that the poultry program was banned 10 years ago amid a significant outbreak.

“We haven’t had any cases in Indiana for quite a while now. It wasn’t really a concern going into the fair this year,” she said. “2015 was the year that we canceled because of it.”

The rabbit program was the next one on the schedule, with a knowledge test at 9 a.m. and breed ID and showmanship scheduled for later in the week. Brad Kelly, from Goshen, was at the fair with four of his children who are in the rabbit program, ranging in age from 8 to 17.

“They enter projects and rabbits. They had their skills test, they haven’t judged them yet,” he said.

Kelly said he enjoyed the $5 food specials on Friday. It was also $5 admission day and carnival ride wristband day, with free big wheel rides around noon, though Aiden, Marissa, Olivia and Izobel aren’t big into the rides, their dad said.

Paula Ax was at the fair with family including granddaughter Cecelia Fry, 10, who’s also a rabbit club member. Ax said the fair food was a draw for her as well.

“Her mom is a 10-year member, so I’m starting another batch of 10-years,” she said. “They have rabbits and my daughter (Jenica Fry)’s on the fair board, and we’re just here enjoying the fair.”

Giora Epstein never gave up on his dream of becoming a fighter pilot. With 17 kills, he became theIAF'stop ace, and the 16 MiGs and Sukhois he shot down earned him the title of world champion in jet aircraft shootdowns. He passed away on Saturday at the age of 87.

Born in 1938 in Kibbutz Negba to Hillel and Chaya, Polish immigrants, Epstein aspired to becomea pilotfrom a young age. Despite his ambition, the Israeli Air Force initially rejected him from the pilot course. Undeterred, he discovered the reason for his rejection, a medical issue. At the age of 25, after much perseverance was accepted to begin pilot training.

After completing the course, he was assigned to fly helicopters. Unwilling to accept this, he appealed directly to Air Force Commander Ezer Weizman. Weizman eventually agreed to meet with him, listened to his case, and, a few days later, informed him: ""Report to Squadron 113 and start an operational training course as a fighter pilot.""

Even's persistence paid off as he quickly established himself as one of the Israeli Air Force's most skilled pilots. In the Six-Day War, he shot down his first Mirage fighter, and during the War of Attrition, he claimed four more kills. In the Yom Kippur War, he was stationed with the NesherSquadron—Israel’s version of the Mirage 5—and he shot down another 12 enemy aircraft and one helicopter.

One of his most remarkable feats occurred when he found himself alone against 20 Egyptian aircraft. Epstein shot down four before being forced to return to base due to fuel shortages. He was known for his excellent vision, which allowed him to spot enemy aircraft before others could, as well as for his shorter stature, which helped him withstand the pressure of G-forces during flight.

Epstein was also a pivotal figure in the events leading up to the Yom Kippur War. At 14:00 on October 6, 1973, he was the man who activated the sirens across Israel, signaling the outbreak of the war.

This came after the Air Force detected sudden takeoffs from Syrian and Egyptian Air Force bases. Epstein’s actions that day were part of a series of critical moments that helped Israel brace for the conflict.

Most of Epstein's kills were made as a pilot in Squadron 101. After the war, in 1974, he became the commander of Squadron 117. He retired from active service in 1977, but his connection to aviation didn’t end there. He joinedEl Aland flew for the airline until 2003. At age 50, in 1988, he was granted special permission to transition to the F-16, continuing to serve as a combat pilot for another decade until 1998. Over the course of his career, Epstein flew approximately 9,000 sorties and logged 5,000 hours in combat aircraft.

In 2018, he was personally awarded the rank of Brigadier General by IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot. In recent years, he became an active participant in the pilots' protest movement.

Epstein lived in Ramat Hasharon and was married to Sara, whom he met while she worked as an operations clerk. The couple had three children."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/arctic-birders-combat-impact-climate-061135185.html,2025-07-20 06:30:00,Arctic birders combat impact of climate change and avian flu on delicate ecosystem,"VARDØ, Norway (AP) — In one of the top Arctic birding destinations in the world, environmental and health challenges are threatening some of the seabirds that are part ofNorway'sunique coastal ecosystem.

The population of kittiwakes has decreased by 80% since the 1990s along the Scandinavian country's coast. The small seagull species, among others, is under siege fromclimate change, predation, local fisheries and thebird flu.

So the town of Vardø, on the remote Vardøya Island in the Barents Sea, has stepped up to help the migrating visitors.

Three years ago, local fisherman Jan Vidar Hansen built a “seagull hotel” out of crates for kittiwakes andother seabirdsto nest in safely. The hotel has the added bonus of limiting the spread of unwelcome smells, dirty nests and droppings that have become a nuisance for the island's human population.

“The first year there was 55 nests. Last year it was 74, and this year we have 76,” Vidar Hansen said. He hopes the local council will agree to build a bigger seagull hotel in the future.

Seabirds have long been an important part of the identity of Vardø — so much so that the local museum has an exhibition dedicated to them. The town is known for its birding tourism as much as its radar station, which provides critical data to the U.S. Strategic Command thanks to its location nearly 60 kilometers (37 miles) fromRussia’s military hubon the Kola Peninsula.

The Gulf Stream

Norway's northern coast is an ecologically diverse area due to its topography as well as the Gulf Stream, which brings warmer water up from the Gulf of Mexico and then mixes with thecold Arctic air and water. This warmer water keeps the Barents Sea free from ice even though it'snorth of the Arctic Circle, and brings tons of fish larvae and other biomass up the Norwegian coast.

But the Gulf Stream is affected by climate change and is now bringing water that is too warm into the Barents Sea, changing the rich composition of the species there. It affects congregations of seabirds, marine mammals and, of course, many fish species.

Fish that need colder water are being pushed further north, while others that require the mix of warmer and Arctic water — like the small schooling fish calledcapelin— are seeing their migration patterns disturbed.

Capelin, for instance, are a major part of the diet for surface-feeding seabirds like kittiwakes, according to Tone Kristin Reiertsen, a researcher with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.

When capelin eitherswim deeper into the seato get to colder water, or migrate further north, seabirds cannot get to them, she said. That in turn impacts the success of seabirds' breeding because they depend on capelin to bring to their chicks.

Boris Belchev, a bird guide and ranger on the nearby Hornøya Island, says it's a frightening domino effect.

""I was seeing birds that usually eat fish on the tundra start eating berries because they don’t have their normal food,” he said.

With fewer seabirds surviving, those who remain are easy targets for predators like white-tailed eagles, Reiertsen said. Plus, fisheries situated close to the coastal cliff nesting sites can disturb the dynamics of the colonies.

And then there'sthe threat of bird flu. In 2023, a large outbreak killed some 25,000 kittiwakes alone along the northern Norwegian coast, Reiertsen said.

“It felt like an apocalypse,"" she said.

Empty nests

Vidar Hansen's seagull hotel in Vardø is one of seven such kittiwake hotels along the Norwegian coast, Reiertsen said.

“It's not an easy task to get the kittiwakes to move in to these hotels,” she said with a laugh.

But it's working. The small seagulls in recent years have migrated deeper into Vardø's center in search of protection from predators. There were roughly 300 kittiwakes nesting in various buildings in the town and now the population there is roughly 1,300, she added.

Before the Vardø hotel, there were ""many empty nests around the whole city,” Vidar Hansen said.

Reiertsen said kittiwakes and other seabirds are crucial to the region's ecology. Their droppings bring important nutrients into the sea, and further decreases in their population could be dangerous to the entire ecosystem.

She said officials need to change their mindset from monitoring the problem to figuring out how to fix it. A potential idea, she added, could belimiting or prohibiting fisheriesand boat traffic near nesting colonies.

“We don’t have much time,” she said. “We have to act quickly.”

Economic drivers

The seabirds are also key to Vardø's economy.

Just a short boat ride away from Vardø lies Hornøya Island, a birdwatchers' paradise. Thousands of visitors flock to the uninhabited Hornøya, which is home to some 100,000 seabirds nesting there during breeding season, including much-loved Atlanticpuffins, common guillemots and razorbills.

But the island's seabird population has also declined dramatically in recent years. There haven't been any recorded common guillemot chicks there since 2018, Belchev said.

“Last summer, I was shocked. ‘What’s going on here? Where are all the birds?’” he said.

If Norway's government closes the island to the public, or birds stop nesting there and the birdwatchers stop coming, it could have a huge impact on Vardøya Island.

“Every small business in the town, it’s depending on thetourists to come and visitthe island and stay in the town and shop and use the gas station and use the small restaurants,” Belchev said. __

https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-ever-blowback-bombing-neighbours-092420167.html,2025-07-20 10:00:00,Will Israel ever get blowback for bombing its neighbours?,"In the last two years, as well as itswar on Gazaand increasingly violent occupation of the West Bank, Israel has launched attacks on Iran, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.

The mostrecent attacks on Syriawere launched this week, going so far as to hit the country’s Ministry of Defence.

Of course, the Israelis point to their justifications for the attacks on Syria – principally, in Israel’s telling, to defend theSyrian Druze minority. A US-brokered ceasefire has taken effect, but whether it holds remains to be seen.

In Lebanon, Israel claimed it wanted to stop the threat posed by Hezbollah.

The attacks on Iran, it said, were to end that country’s attempt to build a nuclear bomb.

And in Yemen, Israel’s bombing was a response to attacks from the country’s Houthi rebels.

Explanations aside, the question becomes whether the Israelis can continue to act in a manner that has many around the world, and particularly in the Middle East, seeing them as the aggressor.

The Israeli argument is that all these conflicts – and the more than 58,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza – are necessary because Israel faces an existential battle that it has no choice but to win.

The Israeli government, in its current far-right makeup, at least, does not seem to care if its neighbours do not like it. Rather, it seems to care that they fear it.

And as the most powerful military force in the region, with the backing of the most powerful military force in the world, the Israelis feel that they can largely do what they want.

Israel is taking advantage of aweakening international orderand a moment of flux in the way the world is run, particularly with the United States under President Donald Trump openly moving towards a more transactional foreign policy.

Western countries had previously attempted to maintain the idea of a liberal international order, where institutions such as the United Nations ensure that international law is followed.

But Israel’s actions, over decades, have made it increasingly hard to maintain the pretence.

The world has been unable to stop Israel from continuing its occupation of Palestinian land, even though it is illegal under international law.

Settlements continue to be built and expanded in the West Bank, and settlers continue to kill unarmed Palestinians.

Human rights organisations and international bodies have found that Israel has repeatedly violated the rules of war in its conduct in Gaza, and have accused the country of committing genocide, but can do little more.

No other power wants, or feels strong enough, to take on the mantle the US is arguably vacating.

And until the rules get rewritten, it increasingly feels like might equals right. Israel, the only nuclear power in the region, is taking advantage.

Supporters of Israel’s actions in the past two years would also argue that those predicting negative consequences for its attacks have been proven wrong.

The main perceived threat to Israel was the Iranian-ledAxis of Resistance, and the argument was that these countries and groups would strike Israel severely if the latter went too far in its attacks.

Israel did escalate, and the reaction from Iran and its allies was, in many cases, to choose to stand down rather than risk the total devastation of their countries or organisations.

Iran did attack Israel in a way that the country had not experienced before, with Tel Aviv being directly hit on numerous occasions.

But some of the worst-case scenario predictions did not take place, and ultimately, the direct conflict between Israel and Iran lasted 12 days, without the outbreak of a wider regional war.

In Lebanon, Israel can be even happier with the result.

After an intensified bombing campaign and invasion last year, Hezbollah lost its iconic leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and much of its military capacity, as well as some of its power in Lebanon. It is now, at least in the short term, no longer much of a threat to Israel.

Israel seems to believe weak neighbours are good for it.

Much as in the case of Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the perception is that there is no real need to provide an endgame or next-day scenario.

Instead, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demonstrated, Israel can maintain chaos as far away as possible from its borders, as long as it maintains security inside.

But the current situation in Syria is an interesting example of what can go wrong, and when Israeli hubris may go too far.

Netanyahu has maintained that Syria south of Damascus must remain demilitarised.

His first argument was that this would ensure the safety of the Druze minority, thousands of whom also live in Israel and demanded that Israel protect their brethren following violence involving Bedouin fighters and government forces.

The second argument was that the new authorities in Syria cannot be trusted because of the new leadership’s past ties to groups such as al-Qaeda.

After Israel’s bombing and some US prodding, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa agreed to withdraw government security forces from the Druze-majority province of Suwayda on Thursday, warning that while Israel “may be capable of starting a war”, it would “not be easy to control its consequences”.

By Friday, it had become clear that thousands of Bedouin – and other tribal forces – were headed to support the Bedouins in Suwayda after reports of massacres against them.

Al-Sharaa, presumably with the acquiescence of Israel, announced that Syrian government forces would deploy in Suwayda to end the ongoing clashes there, and a new ceasefire was declared on Saturday.

As it happens, the presence of a strong state with control over its territory may be more effective than allowing anarchy to reign.

If anything, Israel’s actions in Syria will increase its regional isolation and raise eyebrows among countries that could have been seen as potential allies.

Saudi Arabia has emphasised its support for the new Syrian government, and Israel’s behaviour will add to Riyadh’s feeling, post-Gaza, that any “Abraham Accords” normalising ties cannot happen in the short term.

For many countries in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf, Israeli hegemony, especially with the rise of messianic far-right forces in its government, leads to war, expansionism, chaos, and security risks.

And Israel’s short-term military gains run the risk of blowback elsewhere.

Iran’s military capabilities may have been heavily damaged in its war with Israel, but Tehran will likely seek to shift tactics to undermine Israel in other ways in the years to come, while improving its defences and potentially focusing on achieving a nuclear weapon.

As mentioned, the opinions of regional countries may not be the highest priority to the current crop of Israeli leaders, as long as they continue to have US support.

But that does not mean that – in the long term – Israel will not increasingly face blowback for its actions, both diplomatically and in terms of its security.

Domestically, constant wars, even if beyond Israel’s borders, do not provide a sense of long-term security for any populace.

The percentage of military reservists answering call-ups has already reportedly been decreasing. In a country where the majority of the military personnel are reservists who have jobs, businesses and families to take care of, it is difficult to maintain a permanent military footing indefinitely.

That has contributed to an increasing divide in Israel between a dominant ultranationalist camp that wants to fight first and ask questions later, annex Palestinian land, and force regional acceptance through brute force, and a more centrist camp that – while perhaps not prioritising alleviating Palestinian suffering – is more sensitive to international isolation and sanctions, while attempting to hold on to a “liberal Zionist” image of Israel.

Should current trends continue, and the ultranationalist camp retain its dominance, Israel can continue to use its military power and US backing to yield short-term successes.

But by sowing chaos around its borders and flouting international norms, it is breeding resentment among its neighbours and losing support among its traditional allies – even in the US, where public support is slipping.

A more isolated Israel can do what it wants today, but without a long-term strategy for peace, stability and mutual respect with its neighbours – including the Palestinians – it may not be able to escape the consequences tomorrow."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-ground-forces-enter-central-125947152.html,2025-07-20 14:30:00,More than 90 dead in UN aid truck massacre in Gaza,"Scores of Palestinians were killed in Gaza on Sunday as they mobbed UN trucks in the deadliest incidentlinked to aid distributionsince the beginning of the war.

The UN World Food Programme said its convoy carrying food “encountered massive crowds ofhungry civilianswhich came under gunfire”, soon after it crossed the border from Israel.

At least 93 died at the scene in northern Gaza with dozens more injured, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health.

The Israeli military disputed the death toll but said its troops had fired warning shots towards a crowd of thousands to remove “an immediate threat”.

A UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press, said Israeli forces opened fire toward the crowds who tried to take food from the convoy. Footage taken by the UN showed Gazans running as the sound of automatic gunfire could be heard.

“Today’s mass displacement order issued by the Israeli military has dealt yet another devastating blow to the already fragile lifelines keeping people alive across the Gaza Strip,” The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement.

Ehab Al-Zei, who had been waiting for flour, said: “Suddenly, tanks surrounded us and trapped us as gunshots and strikes rained down. We were trapped for around two hours.”

Nafiz Al-Najjar, who was injured, said tanks and drones targeted people, and he saw his cousin and others shot dead.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the military “certainly does not intentionally target humanitarian aid trucks” and that “a preliminary review indicates that the reported number of casualties does not align with existing information.”

If the death toll is confirmed, however, the incident would be the deadliest single event involving those seeking aid in a string of tragedies to hit the Strip’s displaced population in over 21 months of war.

It comes as the Pope on Sunday criticised the “barbarity” of the war in Gaza, and urged against the “indiscriminate use of force” days after a deadly strike by Israel’s military on a Catholic church.

Meanwhile, White House officials are increasingly frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu, according to leaks in the US media.

Various aides branded the Israeli prime minister a “madman” and “a child who just won’t behave”, referring to his recent bombing campaign in Syria.

“Bibi acted like a madman. He bombs everything all the time,” one official told the Axios news outlet, using the premier’s nickname.

Sunday’s killings around the aid convoy came after huge crowds tried to reach food and medicine entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel, according to Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the health ministry’s records department.

Mr al-Waheidi, a Hamas official, said another six Palestinians were killed in the Shakoush area, hundreds of metres north of a hub of the recently created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the southern city of Rafah.

The GHF, the controversial body set up by the US and Israel to distribute to run the aid hubs in Gaza, distanced itself from the killings.

“The entire aid system is under immense strain,” it said in a statement.

Deaths of civilians seeking aid have become a regular occurrence in Gaza, with the authorities blaming Israeli fire as crowds facing chronic shortages of food and other essentials flock in huge numbers to aid centres.

Seven Palestinians were also killed in tents in Khan Younis in the south in a separate incident on Sunday, including a five-year-old boy, according to the Kuwait Specialised Field Hospital, which received the casualties.

A Hamas official said the deaths and the hunger crisis in Gaza could badly affect ceasefire talks in Qatar.

The group which is blocked from controlling aid under the current system, however, has been accused in the past of preventing Gazans from reaching food parcels and fermenting hostility at aid distribution points.

The group is also known to operate amongst civilians, and officials have been accused of intentionally using Gazans and civilian infrastructure as “human shields”.

The string of killings came as ceasefire talks appeared to have stalled and Israeli troops prepared for ground operations in central Gaza for the first time since the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The IDF warned in Arabic that it was operating with “great force” as it “expands its activities into an area where it has not operated before”.

Though it has conducted air strikes in central Gaza, there have been no ground forces until now, leading many to believe hostages may be held there.

Hamas has warned that if the Israeli military approaches areas with hostages, the captives will be killed.

Families of the hostages have raised concerns over IDF expansion of ground forces into central Gaza.

In February, Hamas released Eli Sharabi, Or Levy and Ohad Ben Ami in Deir al-Balah, an area that until now had remained relatively calm.

“The families of hostages are shaken and fearful after the announcement by the IDF of its intent to operate in central Gaza,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Sunday.

“Can anyone assure us that this will not cost the lives of our loved ones? We expect the prime minister, defence minister and top military commanders to urgently explain to Israeli citizens and the families what the plan of action is and how they would protect the hostages still held in Gaza.”

The forum said that the expansion of ground operations should not be used as a “card” in negotiations for a ceasefire deal, as it poses “a tangible and immediate danger to their fate”.

“Enough! The Israeli people overwhelmingly want an end to the fighting and a comprehensive agreement that will return all the hostages,” the statement added.

Multiple polls in Israel show that a large majority of the Israeli public support an end to the war to bring the hostages home.

Deir al-Balah is also home to multiple Gazan refugees who have been displaced from other areas in the Strip, which has been razed in Israel’s retaliatory attacks after the war sparked by the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023. During the terror attack 1,200 mostly civilians were killed and 251 people taken hostage and moved to Gaza.

Fighting continues across the Strip as ceasefire talks continue in Qatar.Israel blames Hamasfor delaying its response to the proposal while Hamas blames Israel for obstructing its demands.

Thousands of protesters gathered in Tel Aviv again on Saturday night calling on the government to make a deal to bring home the hostages.

While Israel’s war goals include the release of all hostages, only roughly 20 of whom are believed to be alive, they also insist on retaining military control in Gaza, and the complete removal of Hamas.

Hamas says it will not agree to a deal in which the Israeli military retains a presence in the Strip.

The Hamas-run ministry of health in Gaza says over 58,000 people have died in the Strip since the war began, with Israel saying at least 20,000 of those are combatants.

In recent weeks, Israel has also seen dozens of its soldiers die as the war continues to claim lives on both sides.

Three regional countries are discussing aid drops by air as a result of the chaos and killings around aid centres in the Strip, Fox News reported on Sunday.

“One of those countries is actively planning to proceed with airdrops. These discussions started three weeks ago,” a reporter from the network wrote.

A Wisconsin television meteorologist has gone viral for warning his mother of an incoming tornado while he was live on the air at WISC-TV in Madison.

Blaise Keller, a meteorologist for WISC-TV in Madison, was live on the air during the July 16 severe weather outbreak that produced five tornadoes in southern Wisconsin — one of them headed straight for his mother's home.

""A trained spotter has reported a tornado along County Road Z, a reported funnel cloud County Road YZ, so that would be right where we're looking at — so I'm going to text my mom and let her know,"" Keller said during the live severe storm coverage.

Of the five twisters, four were rated as weak, EF0 tornadoes, while the strongest of the bunch — an EF1 that was on the ground near Dodgeville in Iowa County.

The Dodgeville tornado was on the ground 13 minutes and approximately seven miles while producing peak winds of 95 mph and reaching a maximum width of 150 yards, according to the National Weather Service.

""That was kind of my worst fear coming to life on air,""Keller said, fighting back some emotions during an interview with ABC 33. Sorry, it's just something that I didn't think I would have to do, did not want to ever have to do, and I hope I never have to do again.""

In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Tom Barrack also criticizedIsrael’s recent interventionin Syria, calling it poorly timed and saying it complicated efforts to stabilize the region.

Barrackis ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, with a short-term mandate in Lebanon. He spoke in Beirut following more than a week ofclashes in Syria's southern province of Sweidabetween militias of theDruze religious minorityand Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.

Syrian government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up siding with the Bedouins before withdrawing under a ceasefire agreement with Druze factions. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly shot dead Druze civilians and burned and looted homes.

Neighboring Israel intervened last weekon behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. Israel launched dozens of strikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and struck the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus.

Over the weekend,Barrack announced a ceasefirebetween Syria and Israel. Syrian government forces have redeployed in Sweida to halt renewed clashes between the Druze and Bedouins, and civilians from both sides were set to be evacuated Monday.

US envoy suggests Israel wants to see a divided Syria

Barrack told the AP that “the killing, the revenge, the massacres on both sides” are “intolerable,” but that “the current government of Syria, in my opinion, has conducted themselves as best they can as a nascent government with very few resources to address the multiplicity of issues that arise in trying to bring a diverse society together.”

At a press conference later, he said Syrian authorities “need to be held accountable” for violations.

Regarding Israel's strikes on Syria, Barrack said: “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States' responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defense.""

However, he said Israel's intervention ""creates another very confusing chapter"" and “came at a very bad time.""

Prior to the violence in Sweida, Israel and Syria had been in talks over security matters, while the Trump administration had been pushing them to move toward full normalization of diplomatic relations.

When the latest fighting erupted, “Israel’s view was that south of Damascus was this questionable zone, so that whatever happened militarily in that zone needed to be agreed upon and discussed with them,” Barrack said. “The new government (in Syria) coming in was not exactly of that belief.”

The ceasefire announced Saturday between Syria and Israel is a limited agreement addressing only the conflict in Sweida, he said. It does not address broader issues including Israel's contention that the area south of Damascus should be a demilitarized zone.

In the discussions leading up to the ceasefire, Barrack said “both sides did the best they can” to reach agreement on specific questions related to the movement of Syrian forces and equipment from Damascus to Sweida.

“Whether you accept that Israel can intervene in a sovereign state is a different question,” he said.

He suggested that Israel would prefer to see Syria fragmented and divided rather than a strong central state in control of the country.

""Strong nation-states are a threat — especially Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel,"" he said. But in Syria, he said, “I think all of the the minority communities are smart enough to say, ‘We’re better off together, centralized.’”

Later Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted on X that Israel’s strikes “were the only way to stop the massacre of the Druze in Syria, who are brothers of our Druze brothers in Israel.”

Katz added: “Whoever criticizes the attacks are not familiar with the facts."" It was not clear if he was responding to Barrack’s comments.

Distrust among minorities including the Kurds

The violence in Sweida has deepened the distrust of minority religious and ethnic groups in Syria toward the new government in Damascus, which is led by Sunni Muslim former insurgents who unseatedlongtime autocratic ruler, Bashar Assadin an offensive in December.

The attacks on Druze civilians followed thedeaths of hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, to which Assad belongs, earlier this year in sectarian revenge attacks on the Syrian coast. While interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to protect minorities and punish those who target civilians, many feel his government has not done enough.

At the same time, Damascus has been negotiating with the Kurdish forces that control much of northeast Syria to implementan agreement that would mergethe U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the new national army.

Barrack, who spoke to SDF leader Mazloum Abdi over the weekend, said he does not believe the violence in Sweida will derail those talks and that there could be a breakthrough “in the coming weeks.”

Neighboring Turkey, which wants to curtail the influence of Kurdish groups along its border and has tense relations with Israel, has offered to provide defense assistance to Syria.

Barrack said the U.S. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S.’s business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Hezbollah disarmament remains a thorny issue

Barrack's visit to Lebanon came amid domestic and international pressure for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to give up its remaining arsenal after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in November.

Speaking at a press conference, Barrack said the ceasefire agreement “didn’t work.”

Israel has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in Lebanon that it says are aimed at stopping Hezbollah from rebuilding its capabilities. Hezbollah has said it will not discuss disarming until Israel stops its strikes and withdraws its forces from all of southern Lebanon.

While the U.S. has been pushing for Hezbollah's disarmament, Barrack described the matter as “internal” to Lebanon.

“There’s no consequence, there’s no threat, there’s no whip, we’re here on a voluntary basis trying to usher in a solution,"" he said. He added that the U.S. “can’t compel Israel to do anything” when it comes to the ceasefire."

Researchers from Wayne State University have called for urgent action as the country faces its worst outbreak of measles since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.

“We are witnessing a dangerous reversal of one of public health’s greatest achievements,” said Paul Kilgore, co-director of the Wayne State University Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases and director of research and professor of pharmacy practice in the Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.

“What’s particularly alarming is that 17 of Michigan’s 18 cases were unvaccinated. This is entirely preventable. History shows us what happens when we become complacent – in 1990, we saw nearly 28,000 cases and 89 deaths nationwide,” said Kilgore.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are 1,309 confirmed cases of Measles across the country, with three confirmed deaths, the first measles-related deaths in the U.S. in a decade.

While 95% vaccination is needed to prevent outbreaks, the Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases warns that Michigan’s childhood measles vaccination rate stands at only 79%.

Of the 1,309 confirmed cases, 92% were among unvaccinated individuals.

“This outbreak represents a critical failure in our system of public health communication,” said Matthew Seeger, a professor of communication and a Center for Emerging and Infectious Diseases co-director. “Sadly, we’re seeing the consequences of conflicting messages and misinformation leading to confusion, distrust and vaccine hesitancy. Clear, consistent and understandable communication with trusted credible sources is essential to rebuild confidence in one of medicine’s most important public health tools.”

The recommendation follows the decision in June by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to fire all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, widely seen as part of a vaccine-skeptical agenda from the Trump administration.

The Center further warned that measles is highly contagious with 90% of susceptible individuals exposed to the virus becoming infected.

Additionally, the virus can cause “immune amnesia” destroying up to 73% of antibodies that protect against other diseases and leaving survivors vulnerable to other infections for two to three years after recovery.

In the face of the ongoing outbreak, Wayne State researchers recommend parents should immediately verify their children’s vaccination status and schedule catch-up vaccines if needed. They also recommend adults born after 1957 and unsure of their immunity consult with their health care provider.

“The measles vaccine has been safely administered to billions of people worldwide for over 60 years,” Kilgore said. “Two doses provide 97% protection for life. This isn’t just about preventing measles – it’s about protecting our children’s entire immune system and our community’s health.”

Additionally, the center advises health care facilities to review infection control protocols.

Anyone experiencing symptoms – including fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes followed by a rash – should call their health care provider before visiting to prevent further spread of the illness, Wayne state researchers said.

While the disease has been considered eliminated in the United States for 25 years, the country is at risk of losing that status, the center warned, with other nations losing elimination status due to prolonged outbreaks.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/better-testing-less-vaccine-messaging-110205353.html,2025-07-21 13:30:00,"Better testing, less vaccine messaging among lessons learned from historic Texas measles outbreak","(The Texas Tribune) — As the number of Texas measles cases tied to a West Texas outbreak slows to a trickle, South Plains public health director Zach Holbrooks remembers the call from a colleague in an adjacent county six months ago that would change both his — and the state’s — entire 2025.

“Katherine was the first person to let me know there was a case,” said Holbrooks, referring to Lubbock’s public health director, Katherine Wells. A Mennonite child from Seminole’s Gaines County — one of four counties under Holbrooks’ charge — had been hospitalized in Lubbock with measles. “So that’s what got the communication rolling between me and Katherine and the state.”

From that first case reported on Jan. 29, the outbreak in West Texas would make up the largest single cluster of measles cases since the virus was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, killing two and spreading to multiple states. As of this week,762 people have been infected, shattering the previous U.S. record from 2019, when an outbreak among the Orthodox Jewish community in New York City resulted in 649 cases. Nationwide, the United States is suffering its worst measles outbreak in nearly three decades with the West Texas outbreak making up more than half of the1,309 cases nationwide.

While it’s been more than a month since a new case has been reported in Gaines County, cases traced back to West Texas continue to be reported across the state in East Texas’ Lamar and Fannin counties, where this week saw the addition of nine new cases.

Technically, Gaines and Lubbock counties are no longer considered active outbreak counties. The spread here seems to have run its course. “They either got the vaccine, the booster or the real thing,” said Dr. Wendell Parkey, chief of staff of Seminole Memorial Hospital.

But as the region catches its breath and wait for the entire outbreak to end, health professionals like Holbrooks, Wells and Parkey, as well as the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), have all been considering what worked and what could be improved after working the first real infectious disease test, post COVID-19.

Their answers included better reporting of cases at the patient level, more help with streamlining the testing process at the start and surprisingly, a more balanced treatment approach that was not solely fixated on vaccination.

As of Friday, DSHS has spent more than $10.6 million in outreach, testing and resource support to the region.

After that first fateful phone call in late January between Wells and Holbrooks, the two looked not to the 2019 New York City outbreak as a guide in how to respond, but to an outbreak that occurred five years earlier, in Ohio.

They both pored over aNew England Journal of Medicine articlethat detailed how that 2014 outbreak impacted a largely unvaccinated Amish population but was mostly contained from spreading. In that case, two unvaccinated men who had traveled to the Philippines to perform relief work had returned to their community with measles. Eventually the outbreak would spread to 383 residents over nine counties before being declared over four months later. Like the West Texas outbreak, about 90% of those infected in Ohio were unvaccinated.

“I kind of wanted to just wrap my mind around how long, what kind of response are we going to be looking at?” Holbrooks said.

Surprisingly, the bulk of the spread in Texas occurred in a four month period, also.

That timespan and the fact that Ohio’s involved a branch of Anabaptists, a 16th century Christian movement that believes strongly in separation of church and state, was helpful to Holbrooks. He grew up in Seminole, home to a large population of Mennonites, also a part of the Anabaptist denomination.

Both Amish and Mennonite communities have no formal opposition to vaccination but many of their followers are unvaccinated, prompting Holbrooks to immediately seek out community leaders to help spread the word about the outbreak and that vaccination was the best weapon to keep measles from spreading.

While the Ohio outbreak seemed a better comparison than the New York one because it occurred outside a large metro area, there were sharp differences between the 2014 cluster and that in Gaines, underscoring the unique challenges Texas health officials and beyond were up against.

In Ohio, most measles cases were located in areas that reported an overall 95% vaccination, enough to ensure herd immunity. More importantly, the Ohio outbreak had occurred before the coronavirus pandemic, years before vaccination fatigue from a global pandemic set in.

By comparison, Gaines County’s vaccination rate had dropped far below the herd immunity level,to 82%and the number of seventh graders who had filed a conscientious exemption for at least one vaccination with local schools, had grown from 2% in 2014, long before COVID-19,of seventh graders had a vaccination exemption. In 2024, it was nearly 20%.

The Texas outbreak also involved a more mobile population. Seminole in Gaines County is located 35 miles from New Mexico and involved a largely unvaccinated population that traveled often long distances: to Mennonite communities in Mexico and Canada as well as those located in northeastern Texas.

Their penchant for traveling made it harder for public officials to contain the spread, which eventually would lead to cases inOklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, Illinois, Colorado andMexico.

To better track the spread and stop it, the state has worked with local providers and health departments to carefully document exactly how many measles infections occur. To do that, public health officials rely on local providers and hospitals to inform them when there is a case.

However, that number is likely an undercount because it is based on patients treated, not those who ride out the virus from their homes.

Statistically,up to three measles cases per every 1,000measles results in death. Gaines had two deaths, which would indicate the number of infections were far greater than the 441 reported.

“Not everybody who gets sick goes to the hospital,” Holbrooks said.

Among the more popular places for infected Mennonites to seek out health care was with Lubbock physician Ben Edwards, who treated hundreds of patients in a temporary clinic in Seminole. The Mennonite’s skepticism of mainstream medicine elevated Edwards — who denounced vaccines and promoted vitamin A and budesonide, something more commonly used to treat asthma, as alternative prevention and treatment options — to a medical hero for the religious community.

While the local hospital in Seminole regularly reported to Holbrooks’ office every measles patient it treated, information from local providers, such as Edwards, was tougher to come by.

“It was frustrating,” Holbrooks said.

Reporting cases quickly to local health authorities helps them respond more quickly to keep disease from spreading, as well as to keep cases from becoming more serious where hospitalization is necessary.

Emails obtained by The Texas Tribune through a public information request hint at how Holbrooks’ office had to spend extra time retrieving that information from Edwards, who like all physiciansare to report “immediately” to local or regional health officialsmeasles cases.

“I’ve seen multiple news reports indicating that your clinic in Seminole has treated upwards of 300 individuals for measles in Gaines County,” Holbrooks wrote Edwards in an April 14 letter, three months after the first measles case. “After reviewing our records, we have not received any corresponding case reports from your office.”

Eventually Holbrooks’ office received a list of patient names and their dates of birth but few other details. Edward apologized for the lateness, attributing it to a communication error with a community translator who was assisting him with patients.

“She and I had a miscommunication, as I had instructed her to send that list to the local health authority but she thought I had sent it,” Edwards told the Tribune. “Once I was made aware of this oversight, it was immediately corrected.”

Public health officials’ measles messaging focused on getting the word out on vaccination.

Once he reached out to community leaders, Holbrooks worked to get public health messaging aired in both English and the Mennonites’ dialect of informal or Low German.

Holbrooks had wanted to put more vaccination and field clinics closer to the Mennonites but quickly saw that doing so would attract too much attention. News of the outbreak brought a sudden influx of national reporters to tiny Seminole, forcing many locals to shy away from pop-up vaccination clinics where TV cameras and photographers were stationed.

Eventually, Seminole health workers moved to a drive-through vaccination clinic through their local show barn, a local livestock exhibition facility used by youth groups, allowing more privacy for those interested in obtaining a measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine.

Even 75 miles north in Lubbock, Wells, the city’s public health director, found that public vaccination spots, while often a hallmark of back-to-school events in August, were not as big a draw in the larger city.

Both she and Holbrooks recognized later that focusing on vaccination from the start could have sent a message that vaccines were the only option for treatment, possibly dissuading more susceptible residents or those with milder measles cases from asking questions or getting more help.

“We should have one more of a treatment clinic [model] and had more boots on the ground, working with churches … to engage better with the Mennonite community,” Wells said.

These vaccine clinics could have been made less clinical and paired with other options, such as checking oxygen levels and passing out Pedialyte to help infected patients stay hydrated.

Such an approach could have invited more visitors and conversation, resulting in better triaging of residents and letting them know to seek more help from the local hospitals, Wells said.

“We should have found a way to set up something that was free, kind of caring for people with measles, not saying you’re like this infectious person,” Wells said.

From inside Seminole Memorial Hospital, Parkey said his facility was fending for itself as measles cases began arriving in force in February and March.

He would have liked more outreach to the private medical care sector from state and local public health officials.

“We couldn’t stop seeing people. Someone could [have] come out and talk to us,” Parkey said, adding that his experience with public health during COVID was similar. “No one talked to me.”

He wished he had more help with offeringfaster test results to patients. Most hospitals either contracted with local testing labs or sent patient samples for testing in the state’s lab in Austin.

Parkey said the emphasis at the start of the outbreak on vaccines didn’t change minds, especially among his Mennonite patients and he believes it may have hardened the vaccine skepticism of many. In both measles-related deaths,anti-vaccine outfitslike Children’s Health Defense stoked doubt about whether the virus was the cause of the children’s fatalities or if it was something else.

The group’s founder, current U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.came to Seminoleafter the death of a second child and met with Mennonite families. Although Kennedy is no longer with the group, his history offalse statements about vaccinestogether with that personal visit reinforced for many the view that the government should stay out of individual health decisions particularly related to vaccines.

“Anywhere you have a bunch of people who don’t believe in vaccines, you’re going to see it,” he said of downplaying measles.

Wells admits that one of the lessons from COVID is that public health officials had ahard time learning to bend and pivot quickly in reactionto both the ever-morphing virus and the growing knowledge about who was at the greatest risk. By not communicating effectively and immediately when restrictions and advice changed, the public felt a constant whiplash of conflicting information and quickly began tuning out medical updates and vaccination alerts.

As the number of measles cases began to taper in April and May, so did the messaging, a sign perhaps that public health is learning to pivot more quickly to a community’s reaction to an outbreak.

Vaccination was — and is still — touted as the best preventive measure against becoming infected by local and state public health officials. But, byearly April, three days after Kennedy’s Seminole visit, the state health agency posted guidance about vitamin A dosage in response to requests from infected residents for ways to ease symptoms.

“We kind of shifted to harm reduction,” said Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “We always want to give the message that’s going to do the most good to people. If that means vaccination messaging takes a back seat, then we have to adapt.”

However, like any animal product, ham can become potentially dangerous if contaminated with certain bacteria or if incorrectly stored. Behind this popular protein lies an unfortunate history of alarming food safety incidents which resulted in several nationwide product recalls.

These product recallsoccurred for a variety of reasons including packaging errors, mislabeling, and even serious outbreaks like Listeria and Salmonella. Because of the potential danger, companies were left with no choice but to pull these items from grocery stores around the country. In this article, we're revisiting 12 of the most devastating ham recalls to ever rock the grocery industry. Each case serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of food safety protocols and the dangers that can lie in a grocery aisle.

One of the more recent major ham recalls happened in April of 2024, when ConSup North America Inc. had to recall one of their popular ham products. The item in question was their sliced prosciutto ham, which was produced in Germany before being shipped to the United States. The reason for this recall was due to the fact that theConSup North America Inc. prosciutto ham was imported""without the benefit of equivalent inspection,"" which is necessary to receive from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

After the issue was discovered by Germany's Federal Office of Consumer Protection and notified to FSIS, the recall was made. Nearly 86,000 pounds of the ready-to-eat sliced prosciutto ham was recalled, with the affected product being the 5.29-ounce plastic packages containing Stockmeyer Prosciutto Product of Germany produced between September 2023 and March 2024. Thankfully, no customers reported any health issues from the recalled products. In the end, only 6,193 products were recovered.

Of all the reasons a product can be recalled, a Listeria outbreak is one of the most serious. In December of 2021, a staggering 2,320,774 pounds of Alexander & Hornung fully cooked ham and pepperoni products were recalled after a Listeria monocytogenes outbreak was discovered by the company. Shortly after samples of the product tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, the FSIS was informed, and the ham was recalled.

Major national grocery stores including Albertsons had to pull the product from its shelves. Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria that can cause disease and is usually found in areas with unsanitary food production. Once an area is contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, it can be difficult to contain the spread and to make sure the area is safe for food production again.

Once contracted, Listeriosis can give people fevers, muscle aches, nausea, and stomach pain. Children, pregnant people, the elderly, and those who have weakened immune systems can be especially vulnerable to Listeriosis, and extreme casescan lead to death. Thankfully, no customers who purchased this product reported any illness after consumption. There was 1,399,545 pounds of the products recovered from this recall.

Not all recalls happen because of an issue within the product; in some cases it's an issue with packaging that makes it a danger to customers. In December of 2015, Morrilton Packing Co.. was left with no other option but to recall around 12,146 pounds of their boneless ham product after it was discovered that the product's packaging had a mistake on its label. According to the FSIS, the 8 to 9-pound single boneless ham product with the label Cedar Falls Brand Boneless Hickory Smoked Honey Cured Ham failed to show that they contained soy on it.

Soy allergy is one of the more common allergies in the United States, with around 0.4% of children having the allergy. Failing to add this allergen on the label could lead to someone unintentionally ingesting it, which can be potentially dangerous for allergic individuals. This labelling issue was discovered by the plant after they did an internal review of the labels, and the problem was quickly communicated to the FSIS. While 12,146 pounds were recalled in the state of Arkansas, only 1,808 pounds of the ham product was able to be recovered.

Black Forest Ham is one of the most popular store-bought sliced ham options you can buy, but it's only desirable if you actually know what you're consuming. In June of 2018, Land O'Frost, Inc. had to recall some of their Premium Black Forest Ham products after a major packaging issue was discovered. The product in question was the 1 pound Land O'Frost Premium Old World Style Black Forest Ham in plastic resealable bags.

While the front of the plastic packaging correctly labeled that it was containing Black Forest Ham, the back of the packaging was completely inaccurate and was mislabeled as containing Honey Smoked Turkey Breast instead. And so, 4,944 pounds of the product had to be recalled after a customer found the issue and complained. At the time of the recall, these products were already shipped to grocery stores in Arizona, California, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. And 1,219 pounds of the products were recalled, but thankfully no illness was reported from customers.

The USDA and the FSIS take their role in protecting American consumers very seriously, and a big part of that is making sure imported products are carefully inspected and approved before making it on grocery store shelves. This process includes a careful inspection of themeat product as well as the labelto make sure everything is accurate and up to USDA and FSIS standards.

In October of 2023, Olymel, a company based in Quebec, Canada had to recall 11,016 pounds of ready-to-eat ham products after the company failed to present it for re-inspection into the United States. The product in question was their 12 pound Extra Lean Celebrity 96% Fat Free Imported Ham Water Added which were inspected by Canadian authorities but not by the FSIS. After FSIS surveillance discovered the problem, the product was recalled from grocery locations in California. While only 859 pounds of the product were recovered, thankfully no illness was reported from customers.

Unfortunately, failing to inspect their Extra Lean Celebrity 96% Fat Free Imported Ham Water Added in 2023 is not the only scandal that has rocked the Olymel company. In April of 2021, the company faced another major issue when they discovered a Salmonella Enteritidis contamination of one of their ready-to-eat ham products. The product in question was their 12 pound Celebrity Extra Lean Imported Ham 98% Fat Free product.

The Salmonella contamination was discovered during a routine sample collection of the imported ham product by the FSIS and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). After samples of the product tested positive for Salmonella, 6,804 pounds of the ham were recalled. Salmonella, or salmonellosis, is a bacterial disease that hits the intestines. Once infected, Salmonella can give people fevers, stomach pains, and stomach illness. In severe cases, salmonella can become life-threatening, especially for children, the elderly, and those with vulnerable immune systems. Thankfully, no illnesses were reported.

In February of 2019, a truly unfortunate mistake in a product's packaging led to a significant recall for the Sahlen Packing Company. In this recall, the problem wasn't with the ham, but with an unwanted item found within the packaging. According to theFSIS announcement, it was discovered that select packages of the Market 32 By Price Chopper Black Forest Ham were ""contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically plastic.""

The issue was discovered after an establishment carrying the ham discovered the plastic inside the item. The items affected were sold in grocery retail locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. Thankfully, no customers were hurt or affected by this issue. A total of 13,224 pounds of the ham product were recalled, but only 7,865 pounds were recovered. This incident is one of the more unique ham recalls in history, and it certainly isn't one that the Sahlen Packing Company will forget anytime soon.

Johnston County Hams based out of North Carolina was rocked with a major recall when it was discovered that several variations of their ready-to-eat ham products were potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Around 89,096 pounds of the ham products were recalled due to the incident, making this recall particularly notable.

The affected products included 7 to 8 pound packages of Johnston County Hams, Inc. Country Style Fully Cooked Boneless Deli Ham, Ole Fashioned Sugar Cured (The Old Dominion Brand Hams Premium Fully Cooked Country Ham), Padows Hams & Deli, Inc. Fully Cooked Country Ham Boneless Glazed with Brown Sugar, Premium Fully Cooked Country Ham Less Salt Distributed By: Valley Country Hams LLC, and Goodnight Brothers Country Ham Boneless Fully Cooked.

These varying products were recalled from states including Maryland, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina, and Virginia. This recall came to be after one person became ill with listeriosis in September of 2018. In total, the FSIS was able to link four related illnesses, including the death of one consumer in Virginia. In the wake of this tragedy, all retailers were informed to throw out all affected ham and clean all kitchens and slicers that may have come into contact.

In August of 2017, a massive 115,773 pounds of ham products had to be recalled after a dangerous mislabeling error was discovered. Hahn Brothers, Inc., based out of Maryland, had to issue a recall after it was discovered that barley was not listed as an ingredient on the packaging of Lou's Garrett Valley Natural, All Natural black forest seasoned uncured ham nugget, Fully Cooked Wood Smoked product.

The issue was discovered when a customer complained after they realized the product labeled barley as an ingredient on the Hahn Brothers website, but failed to label it on the packaging label on the product. Barley is a semi-common allergy that is especially prevalent in children. Failing to label this allergen could lead to severe reactions if ingested by an allergic person. Thankfully, no reports of any reactions were given to the FSIS. Despite the large number of product that was recalled, only 2,142 pounds were able to be recovered.

Boar's Head is one of the most popular deli meat brands on the market, with fans loving the deliciousvariety of Boar's Head deli meat optionsavailable. Spanning five generations, Boar's Head aims to provide quality deli meat at a great value for customers in the United States, Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, and Panama. However, even this established company has faced some major tribulations over the years, including somenotably (and sadly deadly) Listeria outbreaks.

In July of 2024, Boar's Head was forced to recall 1,305 pounds of their Grab and Go Wedge Ham and their Grab and Go Smokemaster Black Forest Ham. The reason for the recall was due to the exposure of Listeria monocytogenes to these products. This recall affected retail locations in Florida and Georgia. While this was not one of the biggest ham recalls in history, it did gain notability due to the high profile that Boar's Head has.

In January of 2014, Gusto Packaging, based in Illinois, was left with no other option than to recall 67,113 pounds of ham after a Listeria monocytogenes outbreak became apparent. The recall affected three products: the iCentrella Signature, Hardwood Hickory Smoked, Spiral Sliced Ham with Natural Juices, the iAmish Valley, Fully Cooked, Hickory Smoked Spiral Sliced Ham, and the iRipple Creek Farms, Fully Cooked, Ready To Eat, Hickory Smoked, Spiral Sliced Ham.

These products were exported to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Canada. According to the FSIS, Gusto Packaging reported the error after routine sampling discovered the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. While the company meant to hold all affected products in frozen storage, an error led to some of the ham products being shipped out anyways. Consuming Listeria contaminated food can be potentially fatal for vulnerable groups, which made this recall very serious. 18,997 pounds of the product were recovered from this recall.

While all of the other recalls on this list were targeted toward ham products, this particular recall affectedmore than one kind of deli meat. In July of 2001, Sara Lee Foods had to recall 13,600 pounds of their sliced ham products (also sliced beef was recalled), after a salmonella contamination was discovered in the processing facility. The recall affected five products, including the Sara Lee Brown Sugar Ham in 8-ounce packages.

According to the FSIS, this salmonella contamination led to the illness of at least one customer. Salmonella can be incredibly dangerous for vulnerable groups, making this a high priority Class 1 recall. Like the other recalls on this list, this situation was a sobering reminder of the potential dangers that could be hidden in your favorite ham products. While these recalls are rare, they do reinforce the importance of organizations like the USDA and the FSIS in keeping American consumers as safe and healthy as possible.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/biggest-controversies-smithfield-foods-history-204000193.html,2025-07-21 21:15:00,The Biggest Controversies In Smithfield Foods History,"Once a little meatpacking company formed in Virginia in 1936, Smithfield grew into one of the largest food producers in the United States. Specializing in pork, Smithfield helped elevate and popularize the Virginia ham and assisted in makingbacon a key player in the classic American breakfast, along with processing all kinds of pork, pork-based breakfast meats, deli meats, and more. While Smithfield became a household name as a purveyor of fine and special meat products, it no longer makes a lot of those flagship products.The last genuine Smithfield ham is on display in a Virginia museum, for example, and a lot of its offerings, such as itsstaple American hot dog, is made by a Chinese company.

But that stuff isn't even controversial in the long run; those are just the results of business decisions, made to stay competitive and relevant in the ever-contracting and increasingly global corporate food culture. Smithfield's practices, power, and company culture, however, have led to a shockingly high number and variety of scandals and controversies. Here are all the times that Smithfield has made headlines -- and not for the quality or deliciousness of its ham, bacon, and sandwich meats -- and invited scrutiny and government investigation.

Seemingly listening and responding to criticism from animal rights and food watchdog organizations, Smithfield declared in 2007 that it would stop using an animal growth method called gestation crates. As the world's largest pork processor in the world, Smithfield would have changed the industry standard once it completed its planned and announced phase out of the concept.

Cited by the Humane Society as particularly brutal to mother pigs, gestation crates consist of fencing placed around pregnant pigs that have been confined to areas about the size of their own bodies, fully limiting movement. Animal welfare groups praised the move, both at its outset and in 2018 when Smithfield Foods announced that it had almost entirely eliminated gestation crates in favor of a more hospitable farming environment where pigs could move around somewhat. The only hogs subjected to such conditions at that point, Smithfield said, were those awaiting insemination.

But according to Direct Action Everywhere, which placed spies at multiple Smithfield-run pig farms in North Carolina from 2017 through 2018, Smithfield had lied. It was still readily and frequently using gestation crates, particularly to keep pregnant hogs and hogs that had recently delivered babies. Smithfield promised to launch an investigation into the matter, while also saying in a statement that the pigs in crates DxE reps saw and photographed were actually in slightly different crates, or weren't actually pregnant.

Fast food has a child labor problem, and the industrial food production sector just might, too. Smithfield Packaged Meats is a division of Smithfield Foods, and it operates a production facility in St. James, Minnesota. The state's Department of Labor and Industry launched an investigation into the plant's labor practices, and discovered multiple objective violations of strict state laws regarding the employment of workers under the age of 18, committed over a two-year period.

The analysis discovered that between April 2021 and April 2023, the facility utilized 11 minors, aged 14 to 17, three of whom started working for Smithfield at 14. Nine of those 11 underage workers served on shifts past the latest times allowed by state law, and all 11 were subject to work that made them more likely to suffer bodily injury. Smithfield denied any knowledge of the St. James plant illegally hiring children and violating labor laws. However, it did agree to be more conscientious of such legal stipulations in the future and paid a $2 million settlement to the state of Minnesota without having to admit any fault.

""Supply and demand"" is probably the most basic tenet of economics: If a product is plentiful, it's harder to charge a premium for it. Rare things are by their nature scarce, and can command a higher price. Smithfield Foods controls a large percentage of the pork market in the United States, and the company was alleged to have colluded with other major players in its sector to limit supply in order to drive up demand, and then prices on its products.

Suits at the supplier, restaurant, and consumer level all sought to prove that Smithfield had behaved in such a manner between 2009 and 2022. It had produced plenty of pork, and had the capacity to produce enough to meet even the high demand of the general U.S. market, but it had consciously and deliberately held back a large amount of product from distribution so it could claim scarcity with clients and charge them more. Smithfield never admitted culpability, but settled all of the suits with giant payouts. It paid out $83 million to plaintiffs in the direct purchase and ingredient supplier case, $42 million to restaurant supply companies, and $75 million in a class-action consumer case.

Abiding by environmental law isn't just a legal requirement for large companies that make and process things, it's also terrific for a conglomerate's reputation and public image. It's a very marketable notion to be viewed by the world as a good company, one that's doing right in terms of ecology and environmental factors. In the 2020s, Smithfield Foods told the world that even though it variously slaughters millions of hogs each year to acquire the raw materials for a variety of pork products of various levels of processing, it operated in a fashion that was generally healthy for the planet, specifically undertaking measures with an eye toward resource sustainability.

In 2021, Food and Water Watch, Pennsylvania Farmers Union, and other food industry and consumer interest groups filed a 47-pagecomplaintwith the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that Smithfield's positive environmental record and sustainability claims were patently false. Accusing the pork company of misleading customers and potential customers with mistruths, the complaint pointed out that Smithfield is potentially the U.S.'s third-biggest source of water pollution, and that in 2019 alone it was cited for environmental law violations on 66 separate occasions.

In August 1997, Smithfield Foods, by way of two wholly-owned divisions, set a new corporate record in the United States -- but not in a good way. The U.S. District Court, out of Norfolk, Virginia, issued a $12.6 million fine against the corporate entity, the largest ever ordered due for violating the Clean Water Act.

Smithfield Packing Company and Gwaltney of Smithfield both operate pig slaughtering and processing facilities in the town of Smithfield, Virginia. Those meat factories feature in-house treatment operations to manage the tremendous waste created in meat processing. In May 1997, a court determined that the companies didn't employ proper pollution-reduction technology for at least five years, and therefore expelled tremendous amounts of waste and wastewater into the nearby Pagan River, James River, and Chesapeake Bay. Samples of the water detected significant levels of coliform, a bacteria that can make people get very sick, and which is found in the intestinal waste and feces of animals like pigs.

Altogether, Smithfield-owned companies were found to have exceeded dumping limits for coliform, phosphorus, and other dangerous substances. The company was also guilty of faking documents and getting rid of unflattering water quality test results.

Smithfield Foods does business through a number of other names, including the Smithfield Packaged Meats Corporation, which operates numerous subsidiaries, including Nebraska-based Margherita Meats. In December 2021, that division was subject to adeli meat recall that affected millionsof potential customers when the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced an issue with the company's pepperoni. The U.S. Department of Defense conducted a regular safety test on a sample of Margherita Meats' ready to eat and packed pepperoni, and it came up positive for Bacillus cereus, a foodborne illness that presents with a series of particularly egregious symptoms. The toxins made by the microorganism can lead to vomiting and diarrhea in those who eat contaminated food, and it's especially hard on the immune-compromised.

Smithfield, along with the FSIS recalled 8-ounce size shrink-wrapped containers of unsliced product labeled Margherita Pepperoni produced under a single lot code in June 2021. No illnesses were reported to Smithfield or the government by the time that the recall was announced, six months after the meat entered distribution, but 10,900 pounds of the processed meat had to go back to Margherita.

Smithfield Foods is the parent company of Smithfield Packaged Meats Corporation, which provides supermarkets around the country with fully packed, sealed, and preserved meat-based items, like bacon that has already been cooked and processed into a shelf-stable and ready-to-eat form. One of those products is bacon crumbles, and it's all the same stuff no matter whose name is on the label, be it Golden Crisp Patrick Cudahy Precooked Bacon Topping, Smithfield Precooked Bacon Topping, or Member's Mark Fully Cooked Bacon Crumbles.

In May 2022, Smithfield recalled five different permutations of its bacon bits and crumbles, all sold in five-pound packages and all produced around the same times and in the same facility. After one customer called the company to let them know about the discovery of a metallic object in one of its products, Smithfield recalled a grand total of 185,000 pounds of bacon topping, all of it processed between February 21 and February 23, 2022, and March 3 to March 5, 2022. The bacon had made its way into grocery stores in 18 states in every region of the contiguous U.S. Fortunately, at the time of the recall, no injuries from the accidental consumption of metal had been relayed to Smithfield or the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Large-scale hog farming operations generated a tremendous volume of effluent, or hog urine and feces. In eastern North Carolina, a significant hotbed of hog farming on facilities operated by Smithfield Foods subsidiary Murphy-Brown and other companies, lawyers in 2013 began building cases regarding the nuisance and health concerns associated with the lagoons where the effluent is stored awaiting conversion to fertilizer. Attorneys would eventually file 26 lawsuits involving 500 plaintiffs who lived nearby Smithfield farms seeking financial damages to make up for the odors they endured from waste and hog carcasses, as well as nausea, headache, and insect and buzzard investigations.

""We've said from the beginning that we believe these lawsuits are without merit,"" Smithfield Foods corporate affairs director Don Butler toldthe News and Observer. ""Nobody's arguing that there's not odors associated with livestock production, but it is a safe and manageable system with negligible odors when properly managed.""

One of the largest cases resulted in a $473.5 million judgment in 2018 against Smithfield operations, with the state of North Carolina capping at $94 million going to six pig farm neighbors. Another case resulted in residents who lived near hog-farming facilities receiving anywhere from $100 to $75,000 in retributive payments, while a judge in Raleigh tossed out another due to a lack of evidence that the nuisance was so great as to justify Smithfield having to make financial amends.

Circle Four Farms in Utah is among Smithfield Foods' most prolific farming operations. From 2005 to 2007, it contracted with Global Horizons to find workers, and that recruiter brought in a group of rice field workers from rural Thailand, lured to the U.S. with promises of employment at a wage that would elevate them out of subsistence-level farming.

Laced with predatory actions, the whole thing was a scam at worst, or, as it was called by an investigation by the U.S. federal government, a human trafficking operation. Global Horizons, on behalf of Smithfield, told the Thai laborers that they'd be paid $69,660 over the span of three years, but they first had to pay an exorbitant recruitment fee of $14,516. Once they arrived in the U.S., Global Horizons confiscated passports, preventing their free movements or returning to Thailand. And while they were paid the contracted amounts at first, many noticed that Global Horizons stopped paying them, or ceased transferring their paychecks to their families in Thailand. Often, they were made to sleep in rooms with security guards posted outside without proper heating or cooling, making for brutally hot summers and frigid winters. The employees say they also were not fed enough, and resorted to trapping birds to cook and feed themselves. ""We were slaves,"" one former employee told theDeseret News.

Some businesses did just fine amidst COVID-19,while others economically suffered due to shutdown orders and shifting consumer habits. Smithfield Foods continued to procure and produce meat products for homebound Americans through its network of plants, including large units in South Dakota and Wisconsin. Those plants reportedly didn't institute distancing rules or other safety measures to protect its employees from the spread of the very virulent virus in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020. By mid-April, the Smithfield site in Sioux Falls was the single biggest COVID-19 infection zone in the U.S. Without a stay-at-home order yet in place, 644 employees and 135 of their closest contacts were discovered to have caught the virus. That made up half of all South Dakota infections at that point, while one of those workers became the first person in South Dakota to die from COVID-19.

Over in the Patrick Cudahy plant, a Smithfield-run meat processor in Cudahy, Wisconsin, the pandemic hit hard in March 2020. In the wake of an outbreak, management didn't offer masks or protective gear or allow workers to not work in close proximity to one another and strongly discouraged self-quarantining by those experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, statistics about the rapid infection rate were reportedly hidden by Smithfield representatives.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-hits-day-cares-more-184424769.html,2025-07-21 22:00:00,"When measles hits day cares, there are more than just health concerns","Measles is spreading in the United States, and so is the risk of exposure and infection at child care facilities, which often serve kids too young to be vaccinated against the highly contagious disease.

Children’s health is the most immediate challenge amid an exposure, but not the only one. Parents may face three weeks of quarantine that requires them to keep their child at home, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to work without reliable child care.

A mother in Iowa is highlighting just how complicated things can get. Martha Martin has been posting on social media about the ripple effects after a person who visited her 9-month-old son’s day care in Cedar Rapids later tested positive for the illness. The individual was vaccinated and isamong seven cases of measles in Iowa as of July 15. Not all of the infections appear to be connected.

It took public health officials several days to notify the day care of the exposure, but Martin’s son — who had not yet received his first dose of themeasles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccinebecause of his age — was able to receive a post-exposure antibody known asimmunoglobulin. The alert came too late for her son to get an emergency MMR shot, which can be available within 72 hours of exposure.

Martin said she and her husband took their son to an emergency room for the antibody treatment, and she has received some mixed messaging about whether the couple will be on the hook to pay out of pocket. Other children from the day care were given immunoglobulin shots through a clinic organized by UnityPoint Health – St. Luke’s Hospital and the local county public health department. A spokesperson for the hospital system confirmed those details but did not respond to questions about the cost of the shots.

“Day cares can be a terrible place to have a measles outbreak,” said Dr. Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious diseases physician and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “There’s going to be babies there that are too young to receive a measles vaccine. And they are at very high risk, if they get measles, to get a severe case.”

The state of Iowahas a 21-day measles quarantine protocolfor non-immune people, a typical period in part because of how long a person may be able to spread the disease. But Martin said the day care instructed the couple to keep their son at home for 28 daysbecause the antibody extends that period.

“I’m not sure what we’re going to do about that, not sure what we’re going to do about me going to work, my husband, everything like that,” Martin saidin one post on TikTokthat has now been viewed 2.5 million times.

Martin initially responded to an interview request from The 19th but later stopped communication.

A senior staff member who answered a call at the Iowa day care directed inquiries to local and state public health officials. A spokesperson for the public health department in Linn County, Iowa, said it continues to monitor the day care and other places of exposure as needed after “hours and hours” of contact tracing. A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the day care is open and highlighted its protocoldocument.

Martin said her son appears to be fine for now, but she knows symptoms can take some time to emerge. She said while her employer has been understanding, she will use vacation days and her husband will take unpaid time off to care for their son. Throughout her posts, Martin hammered one point a few times.

“Get your kids vaccinated,” she said, adding: “Your kids, you yourself not getting vaccinated — you are harming everybody else.”

In late March, a measles outbreak in West Texas reached a day care in Lubbock, where a child with measles infected several children, according to news reports. Some parents were told to keep their kids at home for 21 days of quarantine.

A representative for the Texas day care did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its co-ownertold a local news outletthat the facility took a mix of precautions in order to keep its doors open. That meant sending some children home and isolating vulnerable children into a classroom while they still attended day care.

“Sending an infant home for 21 days is a huge burden on working families so there was the need to balance risk of exposure vs the need for income,” said Katherine Wells, director of the Lubbock Health Department, in an email.

America’s child care system runs under different levels of regulations, with varying rules by state when it comes to handling infectious disease outbreaks.

Ruth Friedman is a senior fellow atThe Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and former director of theFederal Office of Child Care(OCC). She said day cares work under tight financial margins, and infectious diseases like measles could be a major financial blow, a dynamic that has parallels to the COVID-19 pandemic when some centers had to reduce services or close.

“If you destabilize the attendance and enrollment of children in child care, it can very quickly lead to programs closing their doors and child care broadly becoming unavailable to a community,” she said.

Wells said some parents expressed anger about their child being quarantined, while others said they were simply fearful about their children being exposed to the disease, which can make people very sick: complications include pneumonia, brain swelling and death. Children under 5 and pregnant people areamong those more likely to suffer complications. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people with measles are hospitalized.

The first MMR shot is typically administered to a child between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6. Children between 6 months old and a year are eligible for an earlier shot if they live in or travel to an outbreak area or are traveling internationally.

Iowa health officialshave begun to recommend that parents consider an accelerated shot schedule for their children, which can include receiving the second MMR shot as early as 28 days after the first dose. Two doses are 97 percent effective against measles, which is ata 30-year high around the country.

The risk of measles at day cares is not new. Between December 2023 and January 2024,a day care in Philadelphia reported an outbreakthat spread in part becausea parent sent a quarantined child to day care despite knowing the child, who was not vaccinated, had been exposed to measles. The child, as well as the parent, later tested positive for measles.

Dr. Ericka Hayes, an attending physician and senior medical director of infection prevention at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the chances of more outbreaks in child care settings will depend on factors like vaccination rates within the facility and how it adheres to its policies around illness. She noted that children are contagious with measlesfor several days prior to the onset of a rash— often a primary symptom — but other early signs of infection can look a lot like a common viral infection: fever, cough, runny nose, and red and watery eyes.

“So equally important is if a child is sick they should be excluded from day care,” she said via email.

Friedman said the case out of Philadelphia previews a potential conflict that could emerge as parents reckon with health considerations amid work responsibilities that ensure they can pay their daily and monthly expenses. Federal law does not require employers to offer paid sick leave to its workers, leaving such options up to states. In some cases,states are rescinding those policies despite voters’ wishes.

“There’s this tension — what are you supposed to do with your child if you need to work?” she said. “From a family perspective and from a child care sector perspective, I think the implications could potentially be really, really troubling.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-citizen-among-eight-druze-062752621.html,2025-07-22 07:45:00,US citizen among eight Druze family members executed during Syria’s sectarian violence,"An American citizen from Oklahoma was among eight men, all family members, rounded up and killed in an execution-style attack during the sectarian violence that flared in Syria last week.

Hosam Saraya, a 35-year-old Syrian-American, was identified by two relatives and a friend as one of eight men whose killing was captured on a video that circulated on social media over the weekend.

The video, which has been geolocated by CNN, shows a group of armed men wearing military uniforms and face masks firing on eight captives while shouting “God is great.”

CNN cannot independently verify the identify of the gunmen in the video. A friend of the Saraya family said he believed they were militants aligned with the government. A school in Suwayda founded by Hosam Saraya also blamed government-linked fighters for the attack.

Saraya’s brother Kareem and other family members were also executed, according to two relatives, one in Syria and one in the US, who asked not to be named for safety reasons. The US-based relative said the family’s male members had all been killed – leaving only their wives and daughters.

The killings occurred on July 17 amid an outbreak of sectarian violence between Syrian Druze groups and Bedouin tribes in the Druze-majority Suwayda province.

Saraya, who had studied in Oklahoma before returning to Syria, belonged to the Druze community, an Arab religious group of roughly one million people who primarily live in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. He had gone to Syria to care for his father who was ill, the US relative said.

A female family member who survived the massacre recalled how militants had opened fire on and stormed the family’s multi-story home early in the morning.

“Some of them were wearing military fatigues, some of them were dressed like Bedouins … one of them was wearing a General Security uniform … the black one,” she said, adding, “They told us we are the army of Ahmad Al-Jolani (the Syrian president).”

“They threatened us, told us not to make a sound or we will kill you,” she said. “They threatened us with rape … he told me if you speak I will come and kill you.”

She said the young men in the house had tried to fight off the intruders, but were overwhelmed and taken to a place near the home – Tishreen Square – and executed.

The friend who CNN spoke to corroborated these details, saying he witnessed the militants storm the home and forcibly remove eight men, while leaving female family members inside.

The Syrian government “categorically” rejects crimes against civilians, Nour al-Dean Baba, a spokesperson for the country’s interior ministry, told CNN on Tuesday.

“Everyone responsible for these crimes will face justice, regardless of the ethnicity or sect of the victims. As long as they were innocent civilians, such acts are absolutely unacceptable to us and those who committed it will face justice,” al-Dean Baba said.

The US relative first learned of the attack when one of the female survivors sent her a desperate message: “Pray for us, they kidnapped the boys, they shot the house, they stole stuff”.

Twelve hours passed as the family desperately waited for news, hoping their relatives would return safely. It wasn’t until another overseas relative saw the videos circulating of their execution that they realized the eight men had been killed.

The friend who spoke to CNN said relatives later told him the captives were marched 200 meters to Tishreen Square, where they were lined up and executed. One of the men had sent a final message to friends that read, “Come and help us if you can. They surrounded us,” the friend said.

The friend, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, identified Hosam Saraya’s body after watching the video.

“I don’t know how monsters can do that,” the US relative told CNN.

Asked about Saraya, the US State Department confirmed Monday that an American citizen had died in Suwayda. On Tuesday, spokesperson Tammy Bruce offered condolences to Saraya’s family and said the department was providing them consular assistance, but declined to give further details.

Oklahoma Sens. James Lankford and Markwayne Mullin also confirmed the killing of an American from the state in Syria.

“Hosam was an Oklahoman and member of the Druze community who was tragically executed alongside other members of his family in Syria,” Lankford wrote on X. “We are praying for his family, friends, and the entire community as they grieve this senseless loss.”

Mullin wrote on X that an “American citizen from Oklahoma” was “brutally executed alongside his family members in Syria,” adding he was working with partners in the region to learn more. His tweet did not name the Saraya family.

Widespread violence between the Druze minority and Bedouin tribes in southern Syria erupted on July 13 and has left hundreds dead in the latest explosion of sectarian bloodletting since the authoritarian rule of Bashar al-Assad was toppled by a coalition of Islamist rebels.

The violence drew Israeli intervention in support of the Druze, as well as US condemnation and an international scramble to stop the fighting spiraling further.

The Syrian government said over the weekend thatclashesin Suwayda had stopped after a ceasefire agreement was reached between the government,Druze groups, and Bedouin tribes.

A separate ceasefire was agreed between Syria and Israel. The deal was announced by US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack, who said it was “embraced” by Turkey, Jordan and other neighboring countries.

In her first six months as the nation’s top agriculture official, Brooke Rollins has reshaped the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s focus — “more farmer, less climate,” she summarized. Her leadership will make farmers more prosperous than ever before, she proclaimed.

“This is making America and American agriculture great again,” she told Congress.

But her management has left many within USDA unmoored and frightened. Mass firings have purged scientists, whose discoveries underpin modern agriculture, from seeds to soil management. Indiscriminate terminations will likely deter younger, qualified candidates from joining the effort to address agriculture’s pressing challenges, such as adapting to climate change and containing animal diseases like bird flu.

Rollins-approved funding freezes and cancellations have squeezed small farmers and risked their trust. Rural communities could be kneecapped: Rollins has proposed cutting resources for broadband initiatives andRural Development, the agency that invests in farmers’ communities.

“We might see more farming in the dark, essentially,” said Michal Happ, a climate change and rural community expert at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.

Investigate Midwestspoke with multiple agricultural experts and more than 30 current and former USDA employees to better understand Rollins’ leadership style, her impact on the department and the profound consequences her administration will have for farmers, rural families and consumers.

What emerged was a picture of a leader who has brought sweeping changes and largely embraced President Trump’s agenda of downsizing the federal government. However, Rollins has also been tasked with managing Trump policies that she has privately rebuked and cuts made before she assumed office.

Trump tapped Rollins to head the massive federal department at a crucial time for American agriculture. Farmers are grappling with changing weather patterns, shifting trade policies, and even internal administration critiques of pesticide use — a report from Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” commission, which Rollins applauded, slammed farms’ pesticide reliance.

Trump has praised Rollins’ performance. In mid-April, as an aside during a press conference, Trump thanked her for lowering egg prices. “Brooke Rollins, secretary of agriculture, did a great job,” he said. During his first term, she maneuvered into his inner circle and,asPoliticoreported, has quickly become “one of the most powerful conservatives in the country.”

Rollins has said her mission is to be the voice of farmers in Trump’s cabinet. She appears to have pull with the president, but questions remain about her influence over decisions affecting the USDA and its staff.

Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, appeared to wield significant control over department operations, at least until recently. It influenced everything from policy language to which USDA offices remain open, according to court records and Rollins’ hearing testimony.

In a statement toInvestigate Midwest, the USDA rejected any characterization that Rollins was not solely responsible for department actions.

“The claims you cite are absurd and without merit,” it said. “Secretary Rollins was appointed by President Trump to lead the Department and to insinuate that anyone other than the Constitutionally directed cabinet officer is making the decisions at USDA is unwarranted.”

She’s also been sandwiched between Trump’s signature policy, an extreme stance on immigration, and the reality of agriculture’s labor force.

Because of immigration raids, some farms’ labor pools have been depleted, and, already, some fields have not been harvested. Farmers have pleaded for relief. In early June, Rollins pushed Trump to pause enforcement on farms,The New York Timesreported. After the news broke, Rollins proclaimed she was in lockstep with Trump.

Raids on farms resumed days later, but Trump recently expressed support for giving farmers discretion over undocumented workers.

“Brooke Rollins brought it up, and she said, ‘So, we have a little problem. The farmers are losing a lot of people,’ and we figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written,” he said during a July 4 speech.

On July 8, Rollins said undocumented farmworkers would receive “no amnesty.”

Farming is inherently risky. Making a living depends on good weather and profitable markets. Farmers try to limit variables, but Rollins’ first months have added disorder into the food system, said Mike Lavender, a policy expert for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition.

“All of it is this theme of creating needless uncertainty and confusion amongst people who are trying to do the exact opposite in order to be successful in their livelihoods, support their families and ultimately support their communities,” he said.

The USDA did not directly answer questions about Rollins’ tenure, and, in a statement, it said she was cleaning up a mess left by her predecessor, Tom Vilsack.

“Secretary Rollins is working to reorient USDA to put Farmers First and be more effective and efficient at serving the American people,” the department said. “President Biden and Secretary Vilsack left USDA in complete disarray, including hiring thousands of employees with no sustainable way to pay them.”

In congressional hearings, Rollins said the USDA, which has lost more than 15,000 employees, has enough staff to fulfill its mission. Trump’s desire to make new deals with trading partners — which is causing confusion and financial anxiety for farmers — will create stability for agricultural producers, Rollins has said.

“I do believe, with every fiber of my being, that this era of unlimited or unprecedented prosperity for the ag community is just around the corner,” Rollins told Congress in June. “I’m just really, really sure of that.”

Rollins has painted the present as being “strikingly similar” to the time of the American Revolution, a period she often invokes in speeches. She has also cast her leadership in Biblical terms, citing Romans 13:12, saying she wears an “armor of light” in her current position.

“There is just a lot of darkness — not with this White House or my current boss, President Trump, or our cabinet, but the government in general,” RollinstoldDecision Magazine, a religious publication, during an interview last month.

The USDA did not answer when asked if Rollins views rank-and-file employees as part of the “darkness.” But her management of employees varies drastically from her two predecessors, Vilsack and Sonny Perdue, Trump’s first agriculture secretary.

Perdue was a veterinarian and, as governor of Georgia, had led a large bureaucracy, experience that translated into running a complex federal department in a “thoughtful, analytical way,” said Kevin Shea, a USDA employee for 45 years under Republican and Democrat administrations.

“The first Trump administration at USDA was run very professionally,” Shea said. Now, however, “the USDA political leadership seems to be particularly scornful of its career workforce.”

For instance, very little information filters down to employees. Leadership has not effectively communicated what it wants, so it’s been a “gradual process of learning what is and is not OK,” said Ethan Roberts, president of AFGE Local 3247, a union representing government employees, and a nine-year USDA employee.

Agency staff used to plan months or years ahead, but that’s difficult now because they don’t know if they’ll still have jobs or if the office will exist, said one current employee who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.

Her two predecessors regularly sent department-wide emails that communicated their goals and priorities, current and former employees said. Rollins seems to have a different audience in mind.

“She just posts on X what she’s doing,” said Laura Dodson, the vice president of AFGE Local 3403 and a longtime USDA employee. X, the social media company owned by Musk, requires an account to view posts. “It just seems everything’s coming from DOGE and whatever the White House is saying about federal employees.”

The first Trump administration also instituted funding freezes and reduced staff, including relocating USDA offices out of Washington, D.C. One of the affected agencies was the Economic Research Service, which provides insights into markets the industry relies on.

In 2019, Dodson and her colleagues were called into a conference room. If their job description was called, they would remain where they had established their lives. The others, the vast majority, would be relocated to Kansas City, Missouri. Employees started crying.

Despite that episode from Trump’s first term, Dodson said, the tone of his second stint is markedly different as DOGE, overseen by Musk until May, has wantonly carved up federal agencies.

“They still maintained a veneer of respectability. They were trying to do this for the greater good,” she said about the USDA under Perdue. “Now, with people like Elon Musk, it’s clear this is not the pursuit of efficiency. It’s the pursuit of cruelty.”

Before Rollins was sworn in, DOGE and USDA’s new political appointees began slashing.

Budget officers received a flowchart instructing them to block any money from the Inflation Reduction Act or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, two major economic infusions during the Biden presidency,The New York Timesreported. Judges have ruled the freezes illegal.

Officials, including new chief of staff Kailee Buller, submitted plans for mass firings to Musk’s quasi-governmental organization, court records show. DOGE thought it needed reworking. Then, on Feb. 13, Buller met with Noah Peters, a DOGE operative in the White House. Buller “shared her experiences terminating the employees ‘cause that process was underway at Agriculture,” Peters said.

Rollins took over that night, and, the next day, thousands received termination notices. When Congress pressed her on the mass firings, Rollins shifted responsibility. “That happened before I was sworn in,” she said.

While job cuts and funding freezes were pursued, there appeared to be little knowledge of the USDA’s work.

For instance, school nutrition researchers were told to flag any studies that included the word “class” — an attempt to discover funding for diversity, equity and inclusion, a Trump target, said one employee who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal.

Another time, DOGE’s main liaison to the USDA, Gavin Kliger, requested that the word “tracking” be added to the list of words to flag in grants that could be terminated, according to an email included in a lawsuit.

“Tracking the exact carbon output of soybean yields does not provide a direct benefit to farmers,” he reasoned in an email to staff, “and we can reallocate that funding in a way that more directly benefits farmers.”

Kliger’s LinkedIn resume does not show any experience in agriculture. He graduated from the University of California-Berkeley in 2020 and has worked exclusively for tech and artificial intelligence companies. He hashelped slashstaff and funding at other agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

It’s unclear how he came to this understanding about carbon tracking.

Carbon is essential to soil health, producing higher yields. Knowing how much carbon is escaping their soil can help farmers adopt better soil management techniques. This not only helps farmers grow moreefficientlybut helps keep the plant from warming. Soy industry groups have expressed the importance of tracking carbon footprints.

Also, under a Biden-era rule, measuring carbon output helps put money directly in farmers’ pockets — theycan sell their outputon carbon offset markets.

Despite this misguided reasoning, Kliger appears to have had considerable influence at the USDA.

In the same email, he said he wanted to surpass DOGE’s goal of cutting $120 million in climate-focused grants by a certain date. “I spoke with the Secretary tonight who was supportive of these initiatives – working on getting a memo formalized for her signature in parallel,” he wrote.

Kliger did not respond to requests for comment to his USDA email address. The USDA did not respond when asked about the email or how much influence Kliger had.

“All decisions made at the USDA are at the direction of secretary Rollins to best fulfil (sic) president trumps (sic) agenda,” the department said.

Kliger appears to have moved on. The USDA said his access to theNational Finance Center, which manages employee payroll, has been “deactivated due to lack of use. … We would refer you to” the Small Business Administration.

While voices with no agricultural experience have been elevated, those with expertise — USDA employees — have been pushed aside and silenced, current and former employees said.

One skirmish between DOGE and the USDA’s rank-and-file has involved the Trump administration’s return-to-office policies. Some Republican leaders and Musk have claimed that allowing employees to work remotely is a waste.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced remote work for staffers at the Farm Service Agency, which helps farmers access federal funding. As the year progressed, Perdue, the agriculture secretary at the time, considered calling workers back to the office.

However, an internal study found that employees had actually been more efficient, said Charles Dodson, a 30-year FSA veteran who retired late last year.

Despite that, Trump ordered remote workers back to offices when he retook the presidency. At the same time, DOGE began canceling leases of local offices around the country.

At a May hearing, members of Congress accused Rollins of being unaware that local FSA offices were being closed. Rollins did not deny the accusation. Then at a June hearing, she said the General Services Administration, a DOGE target, was behind the closures. (Some offices have since reopened.)

On the ground, the situation has caused confusion and consternation for USDA employees.

When one employee reported to a new office, they were told they weren’t on the list of transfers. How could they follow the order to report to an office if they weren’t allowed in? Another USDA employee, a researcher, was ordered to report to a Forest Service trailer in the woods. And another employee,according to NPR, was told to report to a shed where a boat was stored.

The USDA has also intimidated its workforce, current and former employees said.

According to Roberts, the department veteran and union representative, USDA scientists have been instructed to deflect questions from university researchers — their frequent collaborators — about the agency’s internal affairs.

“They’re being told to say those things for fear it looks like the USDA is silencing them,” he said, “which they are.”

Surveillance also has increased. While the government has used software to monitor employee emails for years, the Trump administration has altered it to detect emails sent to a personal or college account. As part of a leak investigation, one staffer was placed on administrative leave after emailing their personal account, even though it did not contain the leaked material officials were looking for.

The USDA did not respond to a question about the leak investigation.

Some employees have responded by doing only what is asked of them, not going above and beyond. Dodson, the retiree, recounted what a current staffer told him: “I’m afraid to do anything else. I just want to survive and not get fired.”

In May, after thousands had been forced to leave the USDA, Rollins reassured Congress the department had adequate staffing to perform its mission. For instance, she said, no one from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS — which includes veterinarians and staff battling invasive diseases and pests — had left.

They were “key, critical components,” she said.

The comment shocked APHIS employees. Two weeks earlier, several hundred employees who helped keep pests out of the U.S. accepted the administration’s deferred resignation offers, which would pay them to not work for months. (Some returned after the offers were rescinded.)

Overall, roughly 15% of APHIS’s 8,000 employees have departed following the administration’s attempts to cut headcount,according to DTN. That includes about 400 from the agency’s Plant Protection and Quarantine division, which keeps invasive species out of the U.S., and about 350 veterinarians, said Shea, the longtime USDA employee who was the agency’s leader under Presidents Obama, Trump and Biden.

The cuts will have a ripple effect, particularly during emergencies, he said. To respond, employees will be moved from their regular duties, leaving others to pick up the slack.

The lack of staff is a major obstacle, Shea said.

“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” he said. “APHIS cannot do its job with that level of personnel. It simply cannot do it. I’ve never been more concerned about the agency’s ability to carry out its mission going forward.”

The USDA has implemented a hiring freeze, but in April it exempted APHIS. The agency has posted job listings online.

“Secretary Rollins will not compromise the critical work of the Department,” the USDA said. The exempted positions “carry out functions that are critical to the safety and security of the American people, our national forests, the inspection and safety of the Nation’s agriculture and food supply system.”

Another challenge Rollins has faced is trade, the lifeblood of U.S. agriculture.

When Trump returned to office, he generated chaos in the agricultural markets by starting a trade war and implementing higher tariffs. In response, Rollins has embarked on a global tour to establish new trade partners.

She has announced a few “Make Agriculture Great Again trade wins.” She recently proclaimed that Namibia, an African country, agreed to accept frozen poultry from the U.S. The Biden administration had opened the market after allaying the country’s concerns about bird flu. Also, she declared Costa Rica accepting U.S. dairy a win for Trump. An industry trade groupsaidthe “win has been several years in the making.”

Rollins has said repeatedly that the agricultural trade deficit — the U.S. imports more products from overseas than it exports — is bad for the country. The tariffs were intended to address the deficit, but the narrative hit a snag in early June.

Politicoreportedthe USDA had delayed a regularly scheduled report because it showed Trump’s tariffs could exacerbate the trade deficit. Days later, Rollins defended the delay. “I want to be sure every piece of research we move out is the best, the best-cited, etc.,” she told Congress. (The hearing was about a week after news broke that the MAHA report, which Rollins supported, cited nonexistent studies.)

Perhaps the most pressing issue facing Rollins is helping the agriculture industry as it grapples with climate change, which is altering how farmers grow food and commodities. Rollins, however, has denied the planet is warming.

Her husband is an executive at an oil and gas company, and in a 2018 speech, she said “research of CO2 being a pollutant is just not valid,” according toInside Climate News. More recently, she led the America First Policy Institute, which pushes Trump’s agenda. She employed another Trump loyalist, Carla Sands, who once said the idea of climate change is “Marxism to control humanity,”according toPolitico.

In January, before Rollins was sworn in, USDA employees were directed to “unpublish any landing pages (on the USDA’s website) focused on climate change,” according to court records. Research involving climate change has also been effectively banned, current employees said. If studies include words such as “climate,” “clean energy,” “sustainable construction” or dozens of others, the research will not be funded.

Climate change is having profound effects on agriculture. For instance, the Corn Belt — considered the prime region for growing the valuable commodity used in everything from soft drinks to gasoline — is inching northward. In decades, instead of Iowa and Illinois, Minnesota and the Dakotas could be America’s breadbasket, researchers havepredicted.

More recentresearchshows that, as the world keeps warming and farming gets harder, U.S. corn production could fall by 40% by century’s end.

If the USDA ignores climate issues, farmers could be struggling alone, said Happ, of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy.

“They want to adapt to what’s going on,” he said. “They want to still have their land there and steward it for the next generation or two. Without those resources, they’re going to just have to figure it out on their own.”

The USDA did not respond when asked about Rollins’ household’s financial stake in fossil fuels. At a congressional hearing, Rollins agreed with a representative who said sound policy follows sound science. The USDA did not respond when asked why the USDA was not following climate change science.

In March, Rollins cancelled more than $1 billion in funding that paid small farmers to supply fresh meat and produce to schools and food banks. Supporters of the initiatives — named the Local Food for Schools and Child Care and Local Food Purchasing Assistance programs — said they helped local economies and supplied nutritious meals to growing kids.

In a Fox News appearance, Rollins argued the funding was non-essential because it was a COVID-era program. The funding has helped farmers in most states,according to the USDA’s website.

Nullifying those programs undercut another initiative of the Trump administration, the MAHA push to castigate processed foods and promote healthy products, said Debbie Friedman, with the Food Insight Group, which studies food system infrastructure. At the press conference releasing the MAHA report, Rollins referred to herself as a “MAHA mom.”

“While the MAHA concept is terrific,” said Friedman, specifically referencing its stance on improving the food supply, “the action steps they’re taking are the exact opposite. It’s all talk.”

Rollins has also overseen a divestment in food safety research.

The USDA has forced out 98 of 167 food safety scientists at the Agricultural Research Service, a department arm that studies how to prevent deadly pathogens, such as E. coli or Salmonella, from entering the food supply.

Foodborne illnesses could become more prevalent because the work the scientists were doing will likely just end, said Roberts, the union representative who works for the Agricultural Research Service.

“Who knows what we’ve lost? What discoveries or products that were going to be invented that we’ll just never see?” Roberts said. “We’ll be stuck with the tools we have now.”

A robust food safety system, with research and vigilant monitoring, is necessary to help prevent foodborne illnesses, which not only can hospitalize consumers but also have long-lasting health consequences, said Barbara Kowalcyk, a longtime food safety researcher who is now at George Washington University. In a 2013study, Kowalcyk and her colleagues showed foodborne infections could lead to, among other conditions, chronic kidney disease, arthritis and cognitive deficits.

An example of science and government oversight working in concert to save lives stems from a deadly outbreak in the 1990s, she said. After eating undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box, more than 700 people fell ill and four children died.

The scandal put the USDA’s food safety system under an intense microscope, and the department changed how it protected America’s meat supply. Instead of eyeing and smelling a carcass, the USDA began testing for pathogens, a monumental task to implement.

The original testing procedure was first developed in the 1960s and refined over the decades. Since the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service began using the system — named Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point — cases of foodborne illness from beef have declined dramatically.

“Lots of effort went into that,” Kowalcyk said. “We don’t see the same level of outbreaks in ground beef that we used to.”

Rollins plans on altering the USDA’s, and the country’s, future through her actions. Cutting funding to farmers, axing scientists, instilling fear in remaining employees — it’s about changing the country’s course.

“It isn’t just about the next four years,” shetoldBreitbartin May. “It’s about the next 250 years.”

But it could all backfire on farmers, rural communities and consumers, said Lavender, with the national sustainable agriculture coalition.

“The draining of expertise at USDA,” he said, “whether that’s scientific expertise or just expertise of people who have been there for a period of time and have built up knowledge —  it will ultimately come home to roost.”

Jason Crow says that for the first time since President Donald Trump’s first term, he wasdenied access to the detention center in Auroracontracted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and said that assertions by the current administration that members of Congress need presidential authority to enter such facilities are “wrong.”

The representativeannounced the facility’s denial of his visit on Sunday evening, saying that he was previously denied access during an unannounced visit in 2019 after hearing reports of a disease outbreak at the facility. The facility is privately run by the GEO Group and contracted for use by ICE. Since then, he’s pushed to allow members of Congress the legal right to conduct unannounced, in-person oversight visits of ICE facilities.

2024 reporting: Lawmakers press Aurora ICE facility for ‘increased oversight’ after death, inspections

He told FOX31’s Matt Mauro that he approached the visit like he has other visits in the past: Walking up to the security checkpoint at the main entry and presenting his congressional ID card while also identifying himself as a member of Congress. He said usually, a supervisor will come out to the checkpoint and show the person there the federal laws allowing Congress members to visit.

He said this time, the facility’s employees connected him via phone with the region’s ICE supervisor, who denied the U.S. representative access to the facility.

“I told them very clearly this is a violation of law. I read through the provision of law again,” Crow said. “I said that under federal law, I was invoking my rights and that I would leave the facility and we would figure out the next steps forward, which is what we’re doing.”

Under thePublic Oversight of Detention Centers Act of 2019 and 2024,members of Congress can immediately enter any facility used to detain undocumented immigrants for oversight visits.

Crow told FOX31 on Monday that the unannounced aspect of the visits is critical for congressional oversight to check on the detention facility’s conditions and how it’s operating.

“These unannounced visits in particular are a key part of doing our job,” Crow told FOX31’s Matt Mauro on Monday. “We passed a law years ago that actually allowed us to do these unannounced visits because what we learned is that when you announce the visits, that things change. They dress things up; they kind of roll out the dog and pony show. Doing oversight when it’s announced days ahead versus showing up unannounced are two very different things.”

Crow said that his team is talking to lawyers about possible recourse, but the next steps are still to be decided.

“But in the immediate term, it’s drawing attention to this,” Crow told FOX31. “I think everybody should know that this administration and ICE is preventing oversight by members of Congress to their facility. They don’t want us in there.”

He said that raises questions about why the facility is now closed down, after he and his staff have conducted “dozens of visits.” He voiced concerns that the facility’s staff is trying to hide what’s going on inside.

“I’ve made a priority during my time in office to conduct oversight of all the federal facilities in my district,” Crow said. “So I’m at Buckley Space Force Base all the time, I go to the VA hospital regularly to check on things there and I go to the GEO Detention Center, at least I used to.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security provided a statement to FOX31 about the matter, saying:

“ICE law enforcement has seen a surge in assaults of 830%, as well as disruptions and obstructions to enforcement, including by politicians themselves.

“For visits to detention facilities, requests should be made with sufficient time to prevent interference with the President’s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions—a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority. To protect the President’s Article II authority, any request to shorten that time must be approved by the Secretary.”

Crow told FOX31 he has not heard of any Republican members of Congress being denied entry to ICE facilities, but added he also hasn’t heard of them trying.

SAO PAULO/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Latin American farmers are in for a rough ride if the U.S. slaps secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian exports, such as the fertilizers essential for cash crops from Mexican avocados to Brazilian soybeans and corn.

For farm powerhouse Brazil, which covered about a third of its fertilizer demand with $3.7 billion of imports from Russia last year, there is virtually no alternative to fill the gap if those flows are halted, experts and industry players said.

The 2022 outbreak of war in Ukraine triggered stockpiling of Russian fertilizer in the region. Prices soared briefly, but trade has now normalized. Plans to boost domestic fertilizer production in Mexico and Brazil have made slow progress in the face of relatively cheap Russian imports.

Shipments to Brazil, the world's largest producer of soybeans, sugar and coffee, rose nearly 30% in the first half of this year, the Russian Fertilizer Producers Association said.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte singled out Brazil among a handful of countries that could be hit ""very hard"" by sanctions for doing business with Russia as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed push to end the war in Ukraine.

Fresh sanctions targeting Russian fertilizer imports could ""render soybean and corn production inviable,"" said Lucas Beber, vice president of Brazilian grain farming group Aprosoja.

Mexico also imported more than $580 million of fertilizers last year from Russia, its largest supplier according to government data. Potential U.S. sanctions would pose a big problem for farmers there. ""It would affect Mexico's purchases from Russia of different fertilizers, particularly urea, which is the most widely used in crops such as corn, sorghum, wheat, and even avocado,"" said Raul Urteaga. A former director of international affairs for Mexico's agriculture ministry, Urteaga warned of a drop-off in the quality of fertilizers available if Russian imports disappear. That could weaken avocado production and send prices higher for U.S. consumers. The U.S. accounts for more than 80% of Mexico's total avocado exports, a market worth more than $3 billion last year, according to U.S. government data. ""The price of avocados would increase if producers have to use other alternatives or find fertilizers that are imported from sources other than Russia,"" Urteaga said.

Russia is also top fertilizer supplier for Colombia, another key producer of fruits, flowers and coffee to the U.S. Russia provides about a quarter of Colombia's fertilizer imports, government data shows.

The World Bank has identified fertilizer costs as a driver of food inflation in Central America, contributing to a cost-of-living crisis that has stoked northward migration.

SALES DELAYED

Even fertilizer companies that have already cut ties with Russian suppliers, like U.S.-based Mosaic , expressed fears that further trade disruptions with one of the world's top three fertilizer producers could feed volatility.

""Potential discussions involving retaliation against countries that operate with Russia ... only end up further aggravating the situation in terms of pricing,"" said Eduardo Monteiro, Mosaic's country manager in Brazil, which contributes 40% of the company's global revenue.

He said geopolitical tensions delayed sales to Brazilian farmers for the next crop cycle, which could compromise timely fertilizer deliveries for major crops such as soybeans, which farmers plant from September.

Big privately held fertilizer makers Eurochem and Fertipar, which supply their Brazilian processing plants with imports from Russia according to trade data, declined or did not reply to questions about potential sanctions.

Brazil has touted plans to nearly halve its reliance on foreign fertilizers. Mexico aims to boost domestic production from 33% to 80% of local demand. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum have both prodded state oil companies Petrobras and Pemex to ramp up fertilizer production.

They have made slow progress, however. In Brazil's case, efforts were hampered by factors including lack of funding, potentially costly mineral resources and expensive natural gas, which is key to producing nitrogen fertilizers.

The problem could be partly mitigated after Brazil Potash Corp starts to mine for potash in the Brazilian Amazon, which should happen once the infrastructure and permitting are in place.

In Mexico, debt-laden Pemex has struggled over the years to make fertilizers a profitable business.

Unfazed by local competition, U.S. sanctions or European bans, Russian fertilizer producers say they expect to raise their global market share to 25% by 2030, relying largely on sales to developing BRICS nations including Brazil, India and China.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/interfax-russia-agrees-istanbul-talks-182820523.html,2025-07-22 19:45:00,Interfax: Russia agrees to Istanbul talks with Ukraine on Wednesday,"Russia has agreed to hold a fresh round of talks with Ukraine on Wednesday over the war it launched more than three years ago, news agency Interfax has reported.

The Russian delegation expects the main part of the negotiations to be held in Istanbul to take place that day, the agency reported on Tuesday, citing sources close to the talks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had announced the date on Monday, but the Kremlin has yet to officially confirm it, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov merely confirming that the negotiations would be held in Istanbul, the site of two rounds of previous direct talks since May.

The Russian delegation is again to be led by presidential adviser and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, according to the Kremlin spokesman.

The Ukrainian team is set to be led by former defence minister Rustem Umerov, who has since been appointed head of the National Security and Defence Council.

No major breakthrough expected

Earlier, Zelensky said that detailed ceasefire talks are not on the agenda for the next round of negotiations with Russia.

Wednesday's meeting should instead focus on advancing the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war and children abducted by Russia, as well as preparing a meeting at the presidential level, Zelensky told Kiev diplomats on Monday.

""We need more momentum in the negotiations to end the war,"" Zelensky said, explaining his insistence on a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

He stated that results could only be expected from discussions at the highest level.

Moscow, meanwhile, insists that position papers on possible paths to peace, previously exchanged by the warring parties, are to be discussed at the third round of negotiations.

However, Kremlin spokesman Peskov also dampened expectations, saying that ""major diplomatic work"" would be required to reach rapprochement regarding a ceasefire.

Positions far apart

While Kiev insists on an unconditional ceasefire to allow for negotiations to end the conflict, Russia has been sticking to its maximum demands, including the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the eastern regions illegally annexed by Russia.

So far, the Kremlin has been resisting Zelensky's demand for a meeting with Putin, arguing that such a high-level encounter takes time to prepare in order to be successful.

Ukraine and Russia began holding direct talks for the first time in over three years in May. So far, the negotiations have resulted in a large-scale exchange of prisoners of war, with soldiers under the age of 25 and severely wounded combatants released most recently.

Russia says it has so far released the bodies of 7,000 fallen Ukrainian soldiers as part of the deal. There are no official figures on the number of released soldiers.

Russian attacks continue

Meanwhile on the ground, a child was killed in heavy Russian airstrikes on Ukraine overnight, Kramatorsk Mayor Alexander Goncharenko reported on Tuesday.

The 10-year-old boy died when guided glide bombs hit a residential building in the eastern Ukrainian city, Goncharenko wrote on Facebook. Five other people were injured, he said.

Kramatorsk is part of a metropolitan area in Donetsk that remains under Ukrainian control three years after the start of Russia's war.

However, the front has moved so close that the Russian military can now attack the city with heavy glide bombs, which have a range of up to 40 kilometres.

Moscow annexed the Donetsk region, as well as Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson, a few months after the outbreak of war and demands Ukraine's complete withdrawal from these areas.

Attacks on Sumy

In the north-eastern city of Sumy, three people including a child were injured in bomb attacks, according to the civil protection agency.

Five apartment buildings, a shopping centre and more than a dozen vehicles were damaged it said.

A few weeks ago, Putin announced his intention to create a ""buffer zone"" in the region, effectively by occupying the Ukrainian border areas.

In the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa, there were initial reports of drone attacks in which at least one person was injured. Fires broke out in several places in the city, according to regional media.

Residential buildings and social infrastructure were damaged, Governor Oleh Kiper confirmed on Telegram. Odessa is frequently targeted by Russian drone attacks."

New Mexico health officials Tuesday confirmed Santa Fe’s first case of measles: an unvaccinated child who contracted the virus during travel. The latest case brings the state’s total number of cases to 96, since the outbreak began in mid-February.

Health officials also warned that people may have been exposed at an Albuquerque Amusement park last week during the following times and date:

11 a.m. – 8 p.m. on Thursday, July 17 at Cliff’s Amusement Park at 4800 Osuna Road NW.

Santa Fe makes the ninth county with identified measles cases, joining Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy, Lea, Luna, San Juan and Sandoval counties.

New Mexico Department of Health officials urged any people recently at the location to check their vaccination statuses and report any symptoms that develop in the next three weeks to health care providers.

“Every new case, including those that are a result of travel elsewhere, is a reminder that measles is a highly contagious virus,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “Thankfully New Mexicans are responding to the call to get a measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the best defense against measles.”

Health care providers say the vaccine is the only effective prevention against the spread of the highly contagious respiratory virus. Measles symptoms can develop between one to three weeks from exposure and include fever, cough, red eyes and a spotted red rash usually spreading across the face and across the body.

People can spread measles in the days before and after symptoms appear. Severe complications from measles, including pneumonia, occur in about one in five cases.

The illness that plagued the community was determined to be shigella, a highly contagious gastrointestinal infection that is spread through the fecal-oral route and can be contracted by drinking contaminated food or water or coming into contact with someone who is sick or recently infected with shigellosis.

The shigella outbreak left one person dead, and nearly 70% of people with the infection were hospitalized, according to the research article. The infection spread into the zoo, resulting in the death of six primates and leaving others infected.

Upon learning of the outbreak, BioPark and NMDOH staff worked together to address the spread among both populations. Researchers were able to learn more about the outbreak, how it spread, and where it may have come from.

The research team started by analyzing gene sequence samples from infected humans and primates.

“In looking at the genomes between human cases and the primate cases, we were able to see that in that there were zero differences. So there is no way that happens by chance. That means that they were the same strain of Shigella that was circulating in the zoo and in the human population,” said Sarah Shrum Davis, emerging infections program foodnet coordinator for the UNM Office of Community Health, and an NMDOH enteric team lead.

Based on the data, Shrum Davis, and researchers were able to conclude the Shigella outbreak came from the same source, was introduced around February 2021, and possibly came from Texas. “

“So bacteria evolve at a certain rate, and so Shigella evolves at a rate of about three mutations per year. We were able to look at the genetic sequences of our Shigella bacteria, and the closest strain that matched them did occur in Texas. And so by doing it by looking at the evolutionary rate of the bacteria, this is called a molecular clock, we were able to backtrace about when we think it was introduced into New Mexico,” she explained.

According to Shrum Davis, cases of Shigella are reported year-round across the state of New Mexico. But what caught health officials’ attention was the sharp uptick in cases in the Albuquerque area in both humans and primates around May 2021.

NMDOH began investigating and alerted doctors that the strain was resistant to the first line of antibiotics that are used for treatment, and that they should potentially try and use other drugs to treat patients in this area. The City of Albuquerque also set up portable hand-washing stations to prevent the spread, Shrum Davis said.

As for the ABQ BioPark, it had temporarily closed the Ape Walk while it provided medicine and care to its primates, includingorangutans, siamangs, and gorillas.

Unfortunately, some of the treatments did not work. “I was disappointed and heartbroken when some of our animals were not getting better as quickly as I had hoped,” Carol Bradford, the senior veterinarian at the ABQ BioPark Zoo, said in aninterview with UNM Health Sciences. “Even though they were treated with appropriate antibiotics, the antibiotics didn’t seem to make them feel better very quickly.”

Bradford said there were 13 animals that were affected by the illness over the course of several weeks. “What we do not think happened, and we want to be really clear about this, is that we don’t think that there is any intentional exposure, and we don’t think that, you know, anybody sort of had like contact with animals that they shouldn’t have or anything like that.  No keepers were sick,” said Shrum Davis.

Researchers still do not know how the bacteria spread to the primates, but they do have a guess.

“Our leading hypotheses are that, you know, somebody who, you know, had the Shigella bacteria on their hands threw something into the primate areas and contaminated that way. We also do wonder about the potential of things like house flies bringing it in. Although the zoo does trap for flies, you know, at a certain point, there’s only so much you can do,” Shrum Davis explained.

The ABQ BioPark Zoo does have signs warning visitors not to throw food or other items into enclosures.

CVS Health is providing vaccines to help control the spread.

CVS Health companies are offering the DTaP and Tdap vaccines at MinuteClinic walk-in clinics and CVS Pharmacy locations throughout Florida.

These vaccines are available for patients aged 18 months and older, with the Tdap vaccine specifically provided to adolescents and adults.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that whooping cough is a very contagious respiratory illness transmitted through the air when someone infected coughs or sneezes. Initial symptoms are similar to a common cold, but the condition can progress into intense coughing spells lasting as long as 10 weeks.

Babies and young children are at the highest risk for severe complications from whooping cough, such as pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death.

Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, including immunocompromising conditions and moderate to severe asthma, are also at a high risk of developing severe infections.

This was not idle medical advice: She’d had complications in her first pregnancy that made her high risk if she were to get Covid. Her midwife advised her to get the vaccine while she was still pregnant, to avoid getting Covid in her third trimester and toprotect her newborn.

What should have been a straightforward vaccination turned into a Kafkaesque runaround—one that portends the chaos to come for people trying to get Covid vaccines now and come the fall. The result will be lower rates of Covid vaccination and higher rates of transmission, long Covid, hospitalizations, and deaths with asummer surgealready underway.

In late May, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hadtaken to Xto announce that Covid vaccinationswould no longer be recommendedto pregnant people or healthy children, althoughlong Covid is now the most common chronic condition among children.* A week before, the Food and Drug Administration had alsoannouncedthat healthy people under age 65 would not be eligible for the shot.

The announcement raised a flurry of questions and panic within the public health community: Notwithstanding the fact that this abrupt announcement occurred on social media rather than any official channel, it preempted the late June meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, a team of experts who have handled annual vaccination recommendations for the past half-century. It also, of course, went against thehundredsof studies on the Covid vaccine’ssafety and efficacy.Recent data on last winter’s Covid shotshowed 30–40 percent additional protection against urgent care visits and 40–70 percent additional protection against hospitalizations and ICU stays, with protection lasting six months or more.

The directive was also contradictory, marking an unprecedented divergence in the guidance from public health experts at the CDC and competing information coming down from RFK Jr. and the FDA. TheCDC clearly lists pregnancyas an underlying qualifying condition for a Covid vaccine, anddid not removeits recommendation for vaccination in children from its vaccine schedule.

This all left Haldeman in a tough position. At work at the hospital, she and her colleagues in infectious disease medicine had no idea if she would be allowed to get the vaccine, although they all agreed she should. Haldeman previously had no issues getting vaccinated or boosted for Covid-19, and received a booster during her first pregnancy.

She made an appointment and went to the closest Walgreens. The staff there immediately noticed she was pregnant and told her they couldn’t administer the vaccine—they could only give it to her if she was immunocompromised, and they did not consider pregnancy to fall under that category. “It was very frustrating,” she said.

When asked for comment, a Walgreens spokesperson said that “Walgreens is proud to continue serving our patients as a trusted and convenient resource for immunizations” and will “continue to closely monitor and review all federal and state guidance related to vaccines.” The spokesperson clarified that the policy varies, state by state.

After being turned away, Haldeman called her primary care doctor to see if they could give her the vaccine, but they told her they didn’t have it in stock. The midwifery clinic didn’t either. No one had good advice to offer, other than calling around pharmacies until someone would do it.

So she called a nearby Safeway pharmacy. The person on the phone first said no, but when she objected, she was transferred to a pharmacist. The pharmacist said maybe she could get the vaccine if she got a prescription from her provider and brought that with her to the pharmacy, but didn’t guarantee it would work.

Armed with a prescription, she went to the nearest Safeway, only to discover that it didn’t have the vaccine in stock. At the second-closest Safeway, staff noticed she was pregnant and panicked, and had her sit in a waiting room. “I was in tears at this point, just so frustrated,” she said. “I wasted so much time.”

Haldeman eventually succeeded in getting her vaccination on her fourth attempt, but the experience left her unnerved and upset. “I had to advocate for myself so much to actually get the vaccine,” she said, recognizing that most people, especially those who are hesitant about vaccines in the first place, would likely give up. Moreover, the experience made her feel criminalized: “If someone’s treating you like you’re doing something illegal, then you’re going to assume that there’s something wrong with what you’re doing, even though the evidence is clearly very much in support of getting vaccinated while pregnant,” she said.

A company spokesperson toldThe New Republicthat Safeway is “committed to providing care that aligns with the latest public health recommendations … in accordance with CDC guidance.… Currently, individuals, including those pregnant, with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness remain eligible for vaccination.” Still, Haldeman had to get a prescription from a doctor to obtain the vaccine.

Haldeman’s experience makes clear that medical professionals, pharmacies, and people trying to get vaccinated are all weathering the fallout of RFK Jr.’s announcement restricting Covid-19 vaccines and the muddle that followed, and trying to figure out how to proceed amid the confusion.

“Secretary Kennedy’s decision is already causing substantial uncertainty and access issues,” said Doris Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and expert in legal issues around vaccines.

Just days before the ACIP committee was set to meet, RFK Jr.abruptly firedall 17 of its members—all of whom were preeminent vaccine experts—andappointed eight new ones. Of the new appointments, most were prominent vaccine skeptics, many of whom had clearconflicts of interest. Amid the egregious diversions from established procedures, it has gone virtually unnoticed that the new slate of ACIP members didn’t even meet avoting quorum.

The meeting went ahead, despiteobjections, and the committee ended up postponing the vote on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant people and children.

“I am not sorry that this group—several of which have clear anti-Covid-19 vaccine biases—did not vote on the issue,” said Reiss. “Apart fromDr. [Cody] Meissner, committee members lack subject matter expertise and several have clear anti-vaccine biases.”

The American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP,boycottedthe meeting—“We won’t lend out our name to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children’s health,” said the AAP president in avideoposted before the event.

The Evidence Collective, a group of public health experts and communicators, logged50 falsehoodsstated during the two-day meeting. “The members didn’t seem to understand basic vaccine studies,” said Jonathan Howard, a neurologist in New York and author of the bookWe Want Them Infected.

Though the committee did vote to approve RSV shots and (most) flu shots, the new ACIP chair, Covid and vaccine skeptic Martin Kulldorff, a statistician and epidemiologist, announced two new working groups that would reassess children’s vaccines schedule recommendations.

Both Reiss and Howard commended the CDC staffers for presenting information in an informative and accessible way, despite the significant challenges they faced.

Reiss said that the vote for Covid vaccines could be held in October, when the next quarterly ACIP meeting is scheduled, or sooner at a separately scheduled meeting. Until then, as Dr. Angela Branche, an infectious disease expert at the University of Rochester Medicine,told Rewire, “we are basically operating blind.”

In early July, the American Association of Pediatrics—along with several doctors, including a pregnant plaintiff doctor who also had trouble getting the vaccine—sued HHS, arguing RFK Jr.’s directive and firing of the ACIP members was “arbitrary and capricious” and has caused significant harm to doctors looking to stock and administer the vaccine.

Reiss added that having a plaintiff with standing, or one like the pregnant doctor, “Jane Doe,” who has clearly been directly impacted by the directive, strengthens the lawsuit. (Reiss is not affiliated with the lawsuit.)

“Pregnancy increases the risk of severe illness and complications from infectious disease, including preterm birth and stillbirth,” thelawsuit text states. “However, the Directive creates barriers to access to the vaccine and has left Jane and her husband overwhelmed with stress and uncertainty. Her worries are not just for herself, but also for the health and safety of her unborn child.”

The strongly worded lawsuit underscores the importance of ACIP not only in establishing vaccine recommendations but also in determining insurance coverage, state and local laws, and vaccination requirements in schools and medical settings.

RFK Jr.’s directive restricting vaccine access via X “breaks the promise that the Secretary made to the Senate and the American people not to make it difficult to get vaccines or discourage them,” the text states. “The Directive, unless vacated, will result in preventable deaths, including the unborn and newborns under six months old.”

It continues: “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”

Reiss thinksit’s highly possible to proveRFK Jr.’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious.” As she explained toThe New Republic, “In both the video and the directive, Secretary Kennedy provided very little explanation, let alone a thorough consideration of the existing evidence and a justification for deviating from past agency positions.”

In response to the lawsuit, the so-called “MAHA Institute” sent anunconvincing rebuttal to its subscribers.

Until a judge halts RFK Jr.’s directive, it will stand. Meanwhile, 80 medical associations reaffirmed their commitment to vaccination, while the University of Minnesota–based Vaccine Integrity Project isworking with a number of partnersto offer its own vaccine recommendations regardless of what the now-compromised ACIP decides.

The antidemocratic, anti-science actions at HHS go beyond RFK Jr., who has appointed like-minded henchmen like Jay Bhattacharya to head the National Institutes of Health and Dr. Vinay Prasad at the helm of the influential Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research arm of the Food and Drug Administration, or CBER.

Prasad, who I havewritten about in these pages, is overseeing a “consolidation of power” at CBER. He hasrepeatedly overruledFDA experts’ recommendations for Covid vaccines. He is behind the decree that they be restricted to people over 65 and those age 12 to 64 with underlying health conditions, according to Biospace, a life science news site. A July 9 memo by Prasad,riddled with egregious inaccuracies, argued that he felt “differently about certain aspects” of the FDA reviewer’s conclusions that Covid vaccines should remain broadly available.

“I think there has got to be a ton of frustration at the FDA with Prasad overruling them all based on vibes,” said Howard.

This alarming growth of authoritarianism at HHS is just the beginning. Although thevast majority of Americans,including Republicans, believe vaccines are safe, there will be considerable fallout from giving anti-vaxxers a mainstream platform of authority. In addition to confusion and mistrust, such sentiments have already led to ameasles outbreak, which RFK Jr. is grossly mishandling, and the looming threat of bird flu.

The consequences of these policies will be more transmission of preventable diseases and death, in a time when accessing health care is about to become more difficult, with thelargest Medicaid cuts in historyimminent.

Amid the horrors, it’s easy to forget that Covid-19 remains a threat. “We’ve all sort of gotten numb to it,” said Haldeman. But without tools available to fight it, we’re walking straight into another public health disaster: “It’s really dangerous.”

Both house flies and fruit flies become harder to control when heat waves set in. This reasoning isn’t just anecdotal. It turns out there’s a biological reasoning behind it too.

Flies are cold-blooded and become more active in warmer temperatures. This includes an accelerated life-cycle. Under normal conditions, a house fly takes between 10 to 12 days to develop from an egg into an adult. However, during heat waves when temperatures are in the 90s, this process can take just 4 to 6 days. Fruit flies can produce even more quickly, often completing a full cycle in as little as 4 days. This rapid cycle means fly populations can explode if left unchecked.

The indoor environment becomes especially attractive to flies during hot spells. Not only is it often cooler than the outdoors, but it also offers a buffet of food sources, such as over-ripened fruit, crumbs, spills, pet food, and trash. Standing water in sink drains or plant trays can also provide much-needed water. The combination of food and water indoors makes homes and businesses particularly vulnerable to flies during summer heat waves.

Fortunately, there areseveral effective ways to reduce the risk of a fly outbreakin your home during heat waves. Start by eliminating attractants by cleaning kitchen surfaces, taking out the trash more often, and storing food in sealed containers.

Refrigerate or dispose of overripe produce and rinse recyclables before placing them in bins. Ensure all doors and windows are well-sealed and use screens to prevent entry for flies. For fruit flies, cleaning drains and placing out vinegar traps can quickly reduce their numbers. Proactive steps taken before and during heat waves can drastically cut down on fly problems.

Understanding fly behavior during heat waves can help households and businesses stay one step ahead. By maintaining cleanliness, eliminating breeding spots, and sealing entry points, you can prevent a minor annoyance from turning into a major infestation.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/summer-covid-cases-rising-across-171847344.html,2025-07-23 19:45:00,Summer Covid cases are rising across the U.S. — Is it time for a vaccine?,"As Covid cases begin to rise this summer, many may be wondering: What are my risks, and is it time to get another vaccine?

As of July 15, Covid cases were growing or likely growing in 27 states including Texas, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia and Ohio, according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Rates of positive Covid testshave also been increasingin recent weeks, the CDC says, specifically in the southern region of the country.

N.B.1.8.1is the current dominant variant in the United States, accounting for 43% of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC. It’s an offshoot of the XVD.1.5.1 strain, a descendant of the omicron variant. N.B.1.8.1 was responsible for a surge in hospitalizations in China earlier this year.

It’s been nicknamed “razor blade throat,” as there have been anecdotal reports of some people getting painful sore throats, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Schaffner noted, however, that sore throats have been a common symptom of Covid since it first began spreading.

“I doubt the clinical spectrum of Covid has changed substantially,” Schaffner said.

The uptick in cases comes as many Americans have likely gone a year or longer without a Covid shot.

In May, the Food and Drug Administrationasked drugmakers to update their Covid vaccinesto target the LP.8.1 strain, a descendent of JN.1, which began spreading widely in 2023 and is another offshoot of omicron. LP.8.1 currently accounts for 31% of all new cases, per the CDC.

The new shots won’t be available until the fall, and are expected to be approved only for adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness. Healthy kids and adults who want a shot may have to find an older version or pay out of pocket. A single dose can costas much as $140.

Experts say, however, that population immunity — whether from vaccination, prior infection or both — may shield much of the public for now.

“While we don’t have a lot of high level of immunity in the population right now, because it’s been so long, we may have enough low level immunity to just make it a little bit harder for that virus to transmit easily from person to person,” said Andy Pekosz, an infectious disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University.

Indeed, weeklyhospitalization rateshave remained low, suggesting that the new variant may not be leading to severe illness.

The number of cases are still drastically lower than those this time last year, when the test positivity ratepeaked in Augustat 17.9%. The 2025 season has yet to scrape 5%.

Pekosz said it isn’t unusual for cases to rise during the summer time, when people are likely to crowd indoors to escape the heat. However, he believes that if there is a summer surge of cases, it will be a small one.

“The variants have been around for a while and haven’t caused any major surges up until date,” Pekosz said. “So again, I’m hopeful that if we see a surge, it’ll be a low level surge compared to previous years.”

Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA, said people who are at high risk of severe illness still may want to consider getting a Covid shot, if they can find one.

High risk groups include:

Older adults

People with weakened immune systems

Pregnant women

Those with underlying health conditions, such as asthma and heart disease

Getting a shot is especially important, Levy said, for those who haven’t had one in over a year and whose immunity has likely waned.

“If you’re in a high risk group and you’re in a state where cases are rising, you may want to just get the first available appointment and get a shot to protect yourself,” he said.

People at high risk can then consider getting an additional Covid shot when the updated vaccines are distributed in the fall, he said.

Schaffner, of Vanderbilt, said people in the high risk groups may also want to consider wearing a mask during indoor activities, such as the movies.

Healthy adults and children may be able to wait longer before getting another shot, Levy added.

“If you’re in a lower risk group, that’s where things get fuzzy,” he said. “I mean if you want a vaccine and your health care provider concurs and you can get it.”

Dr. Michael Phillips, an infectious disease doctor at NYU Langone, said that he sees mostly immunocompromised and older adults test positive for the virus. For those who haven’t gotten a Covid shot in years, Phillips said he doesn’t think they should worry just yet.

“If you’re younger, otherwise healthy, I think you’re OK,” Phillips said. “If you have underlying pulmonary disease, you know, if you’re an older age group, now that’s a time when you should be really talking to a doctor and saying, ‘Gosh, should I be getting a booster for Covid?’”

He said that the amount of positive Covid tests NYU Langone has seen has decreased 40% since February.

Fatima Amaeka, a senior analyst at the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at Johns Hopkins, said she expects the current wave to peak around September.

Schaffner said to expect another wave in the late fall and winter.

“[Covid] has two increases each year,” he said. “Everyone is familiar with the winter increase that goes along with flu and RSV.”

Forty-eight Democratic members of the House of Representatives, led by Representatives Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Sara Jacobs of California, signed the letter, saying that the vaccines may expire as they sit in warehouses, wasting the U.S. taxpayer dollars that paid for them.

The letter said 800,000 doses of the vaccines are at risk, and that some 220,000 doses could be viable if the State Department begins shipping them immediately.

“This is a moral, strategic, and public health failure in the making,” the letter said.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Republican U.S. PresidentDonald Trumphas made sharp cuts to foreign aid programs since beginning his second term six months ago, firing thousands of aid agency employees and contractors and throwing global humanitarian operations into chaos.

The Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives passed legislation this month approving Trump’s request for about $8 billion in foreign aid cuts.

Trump has said the U.S. pays disproportionately for foreign aid, and he wants other countries to shoulder more of the burden.

The World Health Organization first declared the outbreak of mpox in August 2024, when an outbreak of a new form of the disease spread from the badly-hit Democratic Republic of Congo to neighboring countries.

Uganda and Burundi also have been significantly affected.

Mpox is a viral infection that spreads through close contact and typically causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. It is usually mild, but can be lethal.

The WHOsaid last monththat the outbreak was still a public health emergency of international concern, its highest form of alert.

The presence of EEE was confirmed in a mosquito sample collected on July 21 in the town of Belchertown in Hampshire County.

“This is around the time we would expect to find EEE in mosquitoes in Massachusetts, especially after an active EEE season last year with four recorded human cases,” Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein said in a statement.

“This is only a first finding and mosquito surveillance will be key to tracking any developing areas of increasing risk,” Goldsteini said. “Today’s finding is an important reminder for residents to take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites.”

EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease that can affect people of all ages.

EEE is generally spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.

There werefour human cases of EEE in Massachusetts in 2024with one death, officials said. There were alsofour EEE-infected horse caseslast year.

No human or animal cases of EEE have been detected so far this year.

“EEE activity in Massachusetts tends to occur in outbreak cycles,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown said in a statement. “When EEE is found in mosquitoes at this point in the season, the risk may increase throughout the rest of the summer. We rely on our mosquito surveillance program to monitor for the presence of virus to let people know when and where the risk is occurring.”

State officials shared the following tips to help prevent mosquito bites and the transmission of the virus:

Avoid mosquito bites and be aware of peak mosquito hours.The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening, after 6 p.m. or early morning. Otherwise, take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing. Mosquitoes can be active during daylight hours when the temperatures are cool.

Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites.Although it may be difficult to do when it is hot, wearing long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Apply insect repellent when you go outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023) or oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)] according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants younger than 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children younger than 3 years of age.

Mosquito-proof your Home and drain standing water.Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.

Install or repair screens.Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having tightly fitted screens on all windows and doors.

Protect your animals.Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools – especially after heavy rains.

Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE.

If an animal is suspected of having West Nile Virus or EEE, owners are required to report to the Department of Agricultural Resources, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795, and to the Department of Public Health by calling 617- 983-6800.

(WWLP) – The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) has announced that the Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus has been detected for the first time this year in the state.

The DPH confirmed the presence of EEE in a mosquito sample on Monday in Belchertown. The virus is a rare but serious and potentially deadly disease that spreads to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Last year, there were four human cases of EEE in Massachusetts with one death, and four cases of EEE in horses.

What to do if you see spotted lanternflies this summer

“This is around the time we would expect to find EEE in mosquitoes in Massachusetts, especially after an active EEE season last year with four recorded human cases,” said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein, MD, PhD. “This is only a first finding, and mosquito surveillance will be key to tracking any developing areas of increasing risk. Today’s finding is an important reminder for residents to take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites.”

At this time, no human or animal cases of EEE have been detected so far this year in the state. The disease can affect people of all ages, and state public health officials are urging residents to take all necessary precautions to avoid mosquito bites this time of year.

“EEE activity in Massachusetts tends to occur in outbreak cycles,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine M. Brown. “When EEE is found in mosquitoes at this point in the season, the risk may increase throughout the rest of the summer. We rely on our mosquito surveillance program to monitor for the presence of virus to let people know when and where the risk is occurring.”

The DPH offers the following tips for the public to be aware of to avoid mosquito bites and EEE this summer:

Apply insect repellentwhen outdoors and use repellents with an EPA-registered ingredient.

Be aware of peak mosquito hours, which are typically from dusk to dawn. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning in high-risk areas.

Wear long sleeves, long pants, and sockswhen outdoors if possible to keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Mosquito-proof your home. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, so it is important to limit the number of places for mosquitoes to breed around your home by draining or discarding items that hold water. Empty flowerpots and wading pools, check gutters and drains, and change the water in bird baths often.

Use tightly-fitted screenson all your windows and doors to keep the mosquitoes outside. Install or repair screens if you don’t have them or if they are broken.

Protect your animals. Keep horses in indoor stalls at night, flush out water troughs and eliminate standing water as often as possible. Speak to your veterinarian about approved pet mosquito repellents.

If your pet is suspected of having EEE, you are urged to report it to the Department of Agricultural Resources Division of Animal Health at 617-626-1795 and the Department of Public Health at 617-983-6800.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/marjorie-taylor-greene-spreading-lies-191844122.html,2025-07-23 22:00:00,Marjorie Taylor Greene is spreading lies about Ukraine’s protests. Russia is taking note.,"On July 22 and 23, Ukrainians took to the streets in the country’s first mass anti-government protests since the outbreak of Russia's full-scale invasion three and a half years earlier.

Thousands of citizens ralliedin cities across the country on the first night with a clear goal: to urge President Volodymyr Zelensky to vetoa bill passed in parliamentthat guts anti-corruption reforms, and to express anger withrecent government attackson anti-corruption figures.

But that didn’t stop the fringe far-right U.S. Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from using the protests to falsely claim that protesters were angry atZelenskyabout the lack of a peace deal withRussia.

“Huge protests erupt in Kyiv against Ukrainian President Zelensky as he is a dictator and refuses to make a peace deal and end the war,” she claimed on X, in a post that went viral with more than 50,000 likes, despite spreading falsehoods about the reason for the protests.

Kyiv Independent reporters present at the protests on both evenings saw no evidence that protesters were upset with Zelensky over the lack of a peace deal.

“Veto the law,” protesters chanted repeatedly, while hand-written signs referenced the bill, the parliamentary members who voted for it, and the anti-corruption institutions under attack, along with more general sentiments of protest.

""12414 is the number of betrayal,"" one sign read, using the number of the bill registered in parliament, while others simply showed the number with an X through it.

When asked about Greene's comments, Vasyl Volotovskyi, a 24-year-old marketing strategist who attended the protest, said, ""I'm honestly shocked by how deep Russian propaganda has snuck into the government of a country that doesn't even border Russia.""

""This claim (in Greene's post) is nothing but a cruel fabrication of the protest's goals. All we wanted was fair laws that represent the will of the people. Myself — and I believe the majority of participants — are actually Zelensky's voters and we were there to show our disagreement with his decision, not to rise against Zelensky himself,"" Volotovskyi added.

In a viral July 22 Facebook post by veteran Dmytro Koziatynskyi, widely credited with helping to organize the protests, he called on Ukrainians to gather in the street and specifically named the effects of the law on the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor (SAP) as the reason.

""As you know, today parliament voted for changes that will eliminate the independence of the anti-corruption system. The members of parliament decided that NABU and SAP should be subordinate to the prosecutor general,"" Koziatynskyi wrote.

""Therefore, take cardboard from boxes and make posters where you write everything you think about the recent onslaught on the anti-corruption system.""

Nor is Greene's claim true that Zelensky has refused to end the war.  The president most recentlyproposed a new round of peace negotiationswith Russia and has repeatedly stressed the need for a ceasefire, proposing a30-day ceasefirein May thatRussia has repeatedly rejected.

A new round of talks beganin Istanbulthe evening of July 23.

So far, Ukraine has made repeated concessions during negotiations, while Russia has refused to back down from its maximalist demands and has emphasized that its goal is ""swift victory and the complete destruction"" of Ukraine’s government.

'Pro-Russian powers will use this for their propaganda'

Greene’s comments, however, were noticed and amplified by pro-Kremlin voices, including the media outlet EurAsia Daily, which had its licenselicense suspended by the European Unionfor being “essential and instrumental in bringing forward and supporting Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and for the destabilisation of its neighbouring countries,"" as well as thestate-owned RIA Novosti, which is also blocked in the EUfor spreading propaganda.

Some of the protesters said they expected Russia to attempt to use the protests against Kyiv, and expressed hope that foreigners would not be swayed by misinformation.

""Yesterday, hundreds of Ukrainians, including me, visited a massive peaceful protest in Kyiv and other cities to protect the independence of two anticorruption institutions,"" Orysia Khimiak, a 32-year-old activist, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Transparency is at least we can provide to our foreign allies and countries that so generously support us with weapons and aid, so we could continue our fight against a terrorist state — Russia that tries to destroy us.

""I know that pro-Russian powers will use this case for their propaganda, and we risk losing support and aid from our allies. I hope Mr. President (Zelensky) won’t let it happen.""

Greene, who has a track record of promoting unfounded conspiracy theories, is one of the most strident opponents of aid to Ukraine serving in the U.S. Congress and has repeatedly been accused of parroting Russian propaganda.

Last year, Greene attempted to amend an aid package to Ukraine, requiring any member of the House of Representatives who votes for the Ukraine aid bill to go and fight for Kyiv. The amendment failed to gain any traction among her peers.

In response, Democrat Jared Moskowitzsubmitted his own failed amendment, proposing that Greene be appointed “(Russian President)Vladimir Putin'sSpecial Envoy to the United States Congress.”

An unusually large outbreak of the Chikungunya virus has been spreading since early 2025, mirroring a similar spread that occurred in 2004 and 2005.

The viral outbreak began in Indian Ocean countries both in the mid-2000s and now. It has since spread to surrounding continents and has the potential to reach the United States.

Islands in the Indian Ocean have been particularly hit hard by the Chikungunya virus, with La Reunion, Mayotte and Mauritius seeing major outbreaks. World Health Organization medical officer Diana Rojas Alvarez toldReutersthat an estimated one-third of La Reunion's population has been infected with Chikungunya.

While Chikungunya is seldom fatal, it can cause long-term disability issues, high fever, and severe joint pain. There is currently no known treatment for the disease, which usually clears up after seven to 10 days.

The Chikungunya virus is carried by Aedes mosquitos, including tiger mosquitos, which can be found throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and The Americas.The Center for Disease Controlclaims that the last chikungunya case in the United States was reported in 2019, but a large outbreak could see the disease transmitted especially across the southern states.

Since May, there have been 800 imported cases of chikungunya in France, leading the WHO to raise concerns about a potential further widespread outbreak. The organization is asking people to help prevent the spread by wearing bug spray and long sleeves in areas that may be exposed to these dangerous mosquitos.

There are also two vaccines available to those in countries at a higher risk of exposure, including Kenya, Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippians.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/heres-where-eee-found-mosquito-212008871.html,2025-07-23 23:45:00,Here's where EEE has been found in a mosquito sample in Massachusetts,"A mosquito sample in Belchertown has been found to be carrying Eastern equine encephalitis, also known asEEE, marking it as the first detection of 2025, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) said Wednesday.

DPH officials first found the positive sample on July 21, the department said in a statement.

So far, no animals or humans have been diagnosed with EEE this year, DPH said. The rare but serious and potentially fatal disease typically spreads through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

“This is only a first finding and mosquito surveillance will be key to tracking any developing areas of increasing risk,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said in the statement. “Today’s finding is an important reminder for residents to take measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites.”

Last year,four people in Massachusetts were infected with EEE, with one death reported, DPH stated. Four horses were also infected with EEE in 2024.

“EEE activity in Massachusetts tends to occur in outbreak cycles,” State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine M. Brown said in the statement. “When EEE is found in mosquitoes at this point in the season, the risk may increase throughout the rest of the summer. We rely on our mosquito surveillance program to monitor for the presence of virus to let people know when and where the risk is occurring.”

The department suggests that people use insect repellent when outside. The repellent should be made with an EPA-registered ingredient such as DEET, permethrin, picaridin, or oil from lemon eucalyptus.

DEET products should not be used on babies younger than two months old and should be used in concentrations of 30% or less on older kids. Oil of lemon eucalyptus shouldn’t be used on kids under three.

The department also suggested that people reschedule any outdoor activities during peak mosquito-biting times — dusk to dawn.

People should also wear long-sleeved clothes to prevent mosquito bites. They should also remove standing water from their homes and install window screens to keep mosquitos out of their homes.

The latest measles case was found in an unvaccinated child under 10 years old in Santa Fe County. Nearly half the cases have been in patients under 18 years old. “A three-week waiting period to watch for symptoms that might develop takes us right into the start of the school year,” said Dr. Mark DiMenna, City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department Deputy Director.

While the vast majority have been found in southern New Mexico,Santa Fe County reported its first case this week, which is something the school district is watching out for. “Of course, if someone came to school that had a rash of unknown origin or a rash with a fever, we would be immediately isolating them and sending them for a higher level of care,” said Myrna Barbee-Lee, Santa Fe Public Schools lead nurse.

There are exceptions for religious beliefs or medical conditions, but all New Mexico students are required to get both doses of the measles vaccine to attend class. If there is exposure at a school, patients can expect to get an official notification. They’re remaining parents that even if their child is vaccinated, they can still contract the virus. “Whether the child is vaccinated or not, pay attention when the school is putting out notifications that there’s been a measles exposure at school, or a sports venue, where the kids have been at where they could have been exposed – watch for those symptoms and take them seriously,” said Dr. DiMenna.

While Bernalillo County has not seen its first case of measles, several patients the state has tracked have spent time in Albuquerque, including in stores, the Albuquerque International Sunport, and other businesses.

The University of New Mexico Hospital is helping coordinate several back-to-school vaccination clinics statewide in the lead-up to school starting. To find a clinic,click this link.

(DC News Now) — They’re on trees, they’re on buildings, and sometimes they fly on you. The invasive spotted lanternflies have taken over the DMV.

Just about everywhere you look lately, there are spotted lanternflies.

“They’re everywhere. And they have no fear, and they don’t get out of your way, and they land on you, and they don’t fly away, and they’re gross,” Taylor Michaelides said.

Bug off! Pennsylvania receiving $1.5M million from feds to fight spotted lanternfly

After being discovered in Berks County, Pa. in 2014, they’ve spread to 17 states.

“I’ve seen them all around, here and in D.C. as well as in New York,” Nayef Bataineh said.

It feels like in just the past few weeks the population has exploded. Yes and no, according to Michael Raupp, known as “The Bug Guy” and professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, College Park.

“When they first hatch from their eggs, they’re about a millimeter. They’re that big. Right now, because they’ve completed development,” Raupp said.

Therefore, more people are noticing them.

“I don’t like bugs at all, so I really try to keep my distance and kill every one that I see,” Emma Rowles said.

“There’s been a lot of publicity about when you see one squash one. Well, that’s like believing you can spit into the ocean and stop the tide,” Raupp said.

People are encouraged to kill the bugs by squashing them, but it’s probably not making a big dent in the population, Raupp said.

If they’re driving you crazy at home, you can buy insecticides at garden centers.

“On the label, it will say, OMRI. These are chemicals that are so safe they’re used in organic food production, and there are some labeled for spotted lanternflies,” Raupp said.

Experts don’t want people putting anything sticky around your trees because that could harm wildlife.

If you really have an infestation on your trees, call an arborist.

Raupp said the biggest threat of the spotted lanternflies is to agriculture, particularly vineyards.

“They can scrape the egg masses because grapevines are low to get them out of there. There are also very good insecticidal controls for these things,” Raupp said.

Spotted lanternflies: Fairfax County encourages people to stop spread

There’s also a concern in residential neighborhoods, with spotted lanternflies excreting a sweet, sticky liquid called honeydew raining down on plants.

“It’s also going to attract stinging insects: bees, wasps, yellow jackets, hornets. This creates a health risk for people and pets,” Raupp said.

Raupp said there is hope down the line because in Berks County, spotted lanternfly populations have declined dramatically, in large part due to a fungus disease that attacks and kills them. However, right now, he said we’re in an outbreak phase in the DMV.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/hershey-other-chocolate-makers-hike-023137450.html,2025-07-24 05:15:00,Hershey and other chocolate makers hike prices as cocoa remains near record highs,"Here’s the good news: The Hershey Co. says it’s not raising prices for Halloween candy this year.

But here’s the bad news: Hershey and other chocolate makers are continuing to hike prices, saying a volatile cocoa market gives them no choice.

Hershey, the maker of Reese’s, Whoppers, barkThins and other chocolate candies, said Wednesday that it will be raising U.S. retail prices later this fall. In some cases, pack sizes will get smaller; in others, list prices will rise. The average price increase will be in the low double-digit percentages.

“This change is not related to tariffs or trade policies. It reflects the reality of rising ingredient costs including the unprecedented cost of cocoa,” Hershey said in a statement.

Hershey stressed that the price increases won’t apply to products specially packaged for Halloween.

On Tuesday, Swiss chocolatier Lindt said it raised prices by 15.8% in the first half of this year. The company said it was able to offset some of the higher cost of cocoa with long-term contracts but had to pass much of it on to consumers.

“The development of the global chocolate market in the first half of 2025 was a continuation of what we saw in 2024, with cocoa prices remaining close to record highs,” said Adalbert Lechner, Lindt’s CEO, in a conference call with investors.

Cloetta, a Swedish confectionary company, told investors last week that it raised chocolate prices in the second quarter. And Nestle raised U.S. prices for products like Toll House chocolate chips in the spring.

Cocoa prices have more than doubled over the past two years due to poor weather and disease in West Africa, which supplies more than 70% of the world’s cocoa.

Cocoa futures, which are binding contracts for a specific quantity of cocoa, stood at $7,380 per metric ton on Wednesday, according to the International Cocoa Organization, which releases a daily average of prices in London and New York.

That’s down from December’s peak of $11,984, but it’s still 121% higher than two years ago.

And the situation remains volatile. According to the International Cocoa Organization, prices surged in early June on concerns about production in Ivory Coast but eased on optimistic forecasts for production in Ghana and Latin America. They rose again in late June after heavy rains in West Africa, which could worsen the outbreak of diseases that harm crops.

“It’s almost a bit dangerous to comment on this because it’s changing so fast,” Cloetta Chief Financial Officer Frans Ryden said last week in a conference call with investors. “This is something that’s moving hugely up and down all the time.”

Meanwhile, prices have been rising on store shelves. The average unit price of a chocolate bar in the U.S. in July 2021 was $2.43, according to Nielsen IQ, a market research company. As of last week, it was $3.45, a 41% increase.

That’s hurting customer demand. Nielsen said unit sales of chocolate fell 1.2% in the year ending July 12.

Tariffs could also impact U.S. prices. President Donald Trump threatened a 21% tariff on cocoa and other products from Ivory Coast in April, for example, but then paused the tariffs’ implementation.

The National Confectioners Association is asking the Trump administration to protect cocoa from tariffs. The group says the U.S. imports nearly $4.4 billion in chocolate, cocoa and candies each year, and the association’s members export nearly $2 billion in American-made chocolates and candy annually.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/columbia-pay-221m-over-3-051255142.html,2025-07-24 05:45:00,Columbia to pay $221M over 3 years in settlement with Trump admin.,"July 24 (UPI) --Columbia University announced on Wednesday it will pay $221 million for the New York City private school to settle its dispute with the Trump administration and restore funding.

Under terms of the deal, Columbia won't admit to violating anti-discrimination laws and will pay $200 million to the federal government over three years and a one-time $21 million to settle investigations by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

In return, ""a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 -- will be reinstated and Columbia's access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,"" the Ivy League school said ina news release.

This includes funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services.

""Columbia has also committed to ending their ridiculous DEI policies, admitting students base ONLY on MERIT, and protecting the Civil Liberties of their students on campus,"" President Donald Trump said late Wednesday ina statementpublished to his Truth Social media platform.

""Numerous and Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it form our government, are upcoming

In March, the federal government revoked $400 million in federal funding over campus protests by pro-Palestinian activists.

Also, the majority of the school's future $1.3 billion in funding had been put on hold, including science research.

Policies already were implemented on March 21 regarding restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and a review of the Middle East curriculum. An independent monitor will oversee the agreement implementation.

The university also agreed to provide the federal government with ""all relevant data and information to rigorously assess compliance with its commitment to merit-based hiring and admissions,"" a senior White House officialtold CNN.

And Columbia will review its admission procedures and ""strengthen oversight of international students,"" the official said.

""While Columbia does not admit to wrongdoing with this resolution agreement, the institution's leaders have recognized, repeatedly, that Jewish students and faculty have experienced painful, unacceptable incidents, and that reform was and is needed,"" the university said.

University President Claire Shipman said she was pleased with the settlement.

""The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track,"" Shipman said in a statement. ""Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.""

Shipman also separately addressed theColumbia community, writing ""as I have discussed on many occasions with our community, we carefully explored all options open to us. We might have achieved short-term litigation victories, but not without incurring deeper long-term damage -- the likely loss of future federal funding, the possibility of losing accreditation, and the potential revocation of visa status of thousands of international students.""

Education Secretary Linda McMahon also touted the settlement.

""The Trump Administration's deal with Columbia University is a seismic shift in our nation's fight to hold institutions that accept American taxpayer dollars accountable for antisemitic discrimination and harassment,"" shesaid in a statement.

""For decades, the American public has watched in horror as our elite campuses have been overrun by anti-western teachings and a leftist groupthink that restricts speech and debate to push a one-sided view of our nation and the world. These dangerous trends fueled the outbreak of violent antisemitism that paralyzed campuses after the October 7th massacre and was previously unthinkable in the United States of America.""

The announcement came a day after Columbiasaidit had disciplined dozens of pro-Palestine protesters who had participated in protests in May.

Other elite schools, including Harvard, have been under pressure to adhere to the Trump administration's policies, including cracking down on anti-Semitism and ending Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives.

""Columbia's reforms are a roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public by renewing their commitment to truth-seeking, merit, and civil debate,"" McMahon said. ""I believe they will ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come.""

Harvard has implemented some changes but sued the federal government over a loss of $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts.

Trump told CNN earlier this month: ""I think we're going to probably settle with Harvard. We're going to probably settle with Columbia. They want to settle very badly. There's no rush.""

Shipman had been concerned about the effects on research.

""Columbia's top scientists are facing the decimation of decades of research,"" Shipman said in aletter on June 12. ""Graduate students, postdocs, mid-career researchers, and established, celebrated scientists, have all had their breakthroughs lauded by the world one minute and defunded the next. We're in danger of reaching a tipping point in terms of preserving our research excellence and the work we do for humanity.""

The university had atotal enrollmentof 26,272 graduate students and 9,111 undergrads in the 2024-2025 academic year. Tuition is $70,000-pus each year with about 90% gettingstudent aid.

About 40% of the student body are international students,Politico reported.

Jewish students comprise 19% undergraduates and 15.9% graduate students, according toHillel International.

""This announcement is an important recognition of what Jewish students and their families have expressed with increasing urgency: antisemitism at Columbia is real, and it has had a tangible impact on Jewish students' sense of safety and belonging and, in turn, their civil rights,"" Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel,posted on X. ""Acknowledging this fact is essential, and along with the new path laid out by the President and Trustees, I am hopeful that today's agreement marks the beginning of real, sustained change."""
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tuna-salad-recall-issued-albertsons-134821735.html,2025-07-24 14:45:00,"Tuna salad recall issued at Albertsons, Randalls in Texas due to listeria risk","Albertsons, Randalls and Tom Thumb locations across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas are voluntarily recalling certain tuna salad products sourced from Oregon-based Reser’s Fine Foods.

According to a Tuesday announcement from theFood and Drug Administration, all affected products contain tuna salad made with breadcrumbs potentially contaminated with listeria monocytogenes.

While healthy individuals may experience mild, short-term symptoms, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionwarns that listeria poses a serious risk to young children, older adults, and people with compromised immune systems.In pregnant women, it can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth or severe newborn infections.

Here are the recalled tuna salad products.

These 10 products were recalled in Albertsons, Randalls and Tom Thumb stores:

According to the CDC, listeria is an infection caused by bacteria that can contaminate foods — especially soft cheeses, deli meats and unpasteurized dairy, which haven’t undergone a process used to kill harmful bacteria. It can be especially dangerous for pregnant women, adults over the age of 65, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

You can getlisteriosisby eating food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. E. coli contamination is typically spread when feces come into contact with food or water, the CDC says. Food handlers can spread infection when they do not use proper hand-washing hygiene after using the restroom. Some wildlife and livestock may also spread E. coli to food and food crops.

Listeriosis symptoms may start the same day you eat contaminated food, but are more likely to begin within two weeks after consumption and may start as late as 10 weeks later,according to the FDA. But E. coli infections typically occur three to four days after consuming the germ,according to the CDC.

Mild listeriosis may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea. Serious infections may lead to headaches, a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. E. coli infections can cause severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting for around five to seven days.

It's good to be aware if you recently purchased a recalled product. There are steps to follow if you do have these products in your home. According toFoodSafety.gov, here are the steps you should take.

Don’t panic: The majority of food recalls are not directly linked to an outbreak of foodborne illness. Instead, many recalls are initiated due to the potential risk of contamination in the food product. In such cases, food manufacturers often issue a recall as a preventive measure to safeguard consumers.

Don't eat the food or consume the drug:To ensure your safety, refrain from consuming any recalled food products. Always prioritize caution over convenience. Additionally, please refrain from donating the recalled food to food banks or providing it to your pets, as they are also susceptible to food poisoning.

Don't open the food:To prevent foodborne illnesses, refrain from opening and inspecting food. Bacteria and viruses responsible for such illnesses are invisible, odorless, and tasteless. If you do handle the product, ensure you thoroughly cleanse your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds afterward.

Check the recall notice to find out what to do with the food: Upon a food product recall by a manufacturer, specific instructions are provided regarding the product's handling. These instructions generally entail one of the following actions: Return the product to the original store of purchase for a refund. Dispose of the product safely to prevent it from being consumed by humans or animals, especially if the packaging has been opened.

Credit - Stefano Costantino—SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images

We have watched with increasing dismay and as the government ofUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyhas acted against political opponents, culminating in recent measures tostripthe country’s anti-corruption institutions of power amid thesanctioningof prominent political opponents, thedetainingof vocalskepticson apparently specious charges, and apatternof democratic backsliding. President Zelensky has been lionized as a hero, but these missteps are a reminder that all leaders are susceptible to errors.

Such missteps have inflamed Ukrainian civil society. Videos shared by Ukrainian anti-corruption activist leader Daria Kaleniuk show thousands of outraged protesters taking to the streets of Kyiv, in the first anti-government demonstration since the outbreak of Putin’s invasion, and what appears to be thelargest demonstrationsince the Maidan Revolution of 2014, which led to the ouster of pro-Russian Putin leader Viktor Yanukovych.

Capturing the sentiments of many, one Ukrainian activist, Kateryna Amelinasaid, “My husband is in the trenches and this is not what they are fighting for…this could be the destruction of 10 years of work by civil society.” These actions have provoked similar global outcry from Ukraine’s allies, including top EU leaders.

Zelensky,claimsthat these crackdowns are needed because anti-corruption investigations were tainted by Russian influence and were doingPutin’s bidding. Now, Ukraine’s domestic security police force has been busydetaininganti-corruption activists on supposed “links to Russia.” These crackdowns may fracture Ukrainian unity and undermine global support at a time when Ukraine can ill-afford such mistakes. The response of the Zelensky Administration tosmearanti-corruption probes as Russian propaganda is misguided and self-defeating, as many within Ukraine point out.

At the same time, we do recognize the fact that there has been too much corruption pervading the Ukrainian government. Former Deputy Chief of Staff Rostyslav Shurma was ensnared in ascandalwhere his brother’s company received subsidies from the Ukrainian government for solar plants in Russian-occupied territories. Former Agriculture Minister Mykola Solsky wasarrestedafter documents emerged suggesting his involvement in a land grab scheme, in which he apparently led co-conspirators in seizing 1,250 land plots totaling nearly 2,500 hectares. And Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov was enveloped in a high-profile scandal where heallegedlyaccepted bribes in return for helping a powerful developer seize valuable land in Kyiv on the cheap. The list goes on with allegations of wrongdoing in everything fromquestionable privatizationstoembezzlementtoself-dealing.  With aid for Ukraine becoming a political lightning rod, sweeping credible allegations under the rug and pretending there is no problem is not the right move.

Time and time again, when existential challenges beckon, Zelensky has shown he can summon the courage and clarity to meet the moment. Already, we are told that Zelensky is considering a new bill which restores some of Ukraine’s anti-corruption infrastructure, which would be a positive first step. But much more needs to be done to restore shattered trust, and it’s not too late to right the course. Acknowledging mistakes and reversing course rather than digging in is a mark of true leadership.

The South Dakota Department of Health (SDDOH) wrote in a press release that as of July 23, in South Dakota, there have been three human cases in Brookings, Marshall and Spink County.

Of these three cases, one person ended up dying due to the virus. It was not specified in which county the deadly case occurred.

According to the press release, there is one human viremic blood donor (blood tested positive for WNV, despite person not displaying symptoms at time of blood donation) in Brown County.

SDDOH reports that seven counties have mosquito pools positive for West Nile: Beadle, Brown, Brookings, Codington, Hughes, Lincoln, and Minnehaha.

The West Nile virus prediction model projects that the total number of cases for SD in 2025 could potentially be as high as 134 cases, ranking SD and other states in “outbreak” territory.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ranchers-southern-mexico-struggling-against-191709396.html,2025-07-24 19:45:00,Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling against a flesh-eating parasite infecting livestock,"CINTALAPA, Mexico (AP) — With Mexican cattle again barred this month from entry to the United States over fears of spreading a flesh-eating parasite, ranchers and veterinarians in Mexico hundreds of miles from the border are fighting what has U.S. agricultural authorities so on edge.

In the southern state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala, theNew World screwwormfly’s rapid spread appears to have caught most ranchers off guard, despite memories of previous outbreaks in the 1980s and 1990s.

Mexico is building a plant with U.S. support in Chiapasto produce sterile flies, which have proven effective at stopping the spread, but it won’t be ready until next year. Meanwhile, the price of medicines used to treat livestock infected with the screwworm have soared in price.

That has led some to fall back on home remedies like applying gasoline or lime to open wounds to coax out the worms.

In addition to the cost of the medicine, treatment requires careful monitoring and usually involves multiple courses. Any open wound, even very small ones, are an invitation to the fly to lay its eggs.

Veterinarian Alfredo Chávez left Chiapas to study in 1989, so he says he missed seeing the effects of that outbreak, but now he’s seen cases multiply in his corner of the state over the past month.

He’s heard of dozens of cases in the area now and treated about a dozen himself. It’s not just cows either — sheep, pigs, cats and dogs are targets as well.

Armed with a pair of blue tweezers and an aerosol spray that helps draw the maggots out, Chávez moves from animal to animal. He puts maggots in plastic tubes as samples, which he provides to agricultural authorities.

But beyond providing the tubes and encouraging ranchers to report cases, he said that the government hasn't provided much help.

“We’ve faced it alone,” he said Wednesday.

The U.S. had justgradually started to reopen the borderto cattle imports this month after anearlier suspension in May, when the Trump administrationsaid that it would close it againafter an infected animal was found in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz. While prevalent in Central America, the concern is that the fly is moving north.

U.S. officials worry that if the fly reaches Texas, its maggots could cause large economic losses, something that happened decades ago.

Ranch caretaker Edi Valencia Santos said that Mexican government officials have come to his community to talk to people with livestock, but so far without resources. He has had five infected animals on the ranch.

Despite cattle in this region going to domestic consumption rather than to the U.S., the presence of the screwworm in Mexico has frozen cattle exports to the U.S. nationwide.

Valencia said that he remembers the small planes distributing sterile flies during those earlier outbreaks, so is optimistic they will eventually help, but for now the costs are piling up on ranchers.

“It’s a big, big problem in Chiapas,” he said."

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/behind-scenes-mosquito-testing-valley-195223327.html,2025-07-24 23:45:00,Behind the scenes: Mosquito testing in the Valley,"AUSTINTOWN, Ohio(WKBN) — After mosquitoes around the Valley have tested positive for West Nile Virus, First News visited Mahoning County Public Health for a behind-the-scenes tour, taking a look at how mosquitoes are tested and what the positive results mean for residents.

So far this year,monitoring by the health districthas found that mosquitoes in Boardman, Austintown, Poland, Beaver and Springfield townships have tested positive for carrying the West Nile Virus — along with locations inMercer County. But how are the tests conducted, and what do these positive results mean for residents?

First News shadowed Colton Masters, director of environmental health, along with a couple of his interns, through the entire mosquito-testing process. His bottom line: don’t let these positive tests keep you from enjoying the outdoors.

“Even though you see these reports coming out about West Nile positives in parks and in systems across the county, we by no means want people to avoid the outdoors,” Masters said. “I want people to be outside. I want them to get exercise and fresh air, and it’s good for us to be in the outdoors… But what I do want people to understand is there are simple ways you can protect yourself from this.”

It starts with mosquito surveillance traps being placed in local parks. The traps are bins of stagnant water — designed to entice mosquitoes but not necessarily other insects — with a fan that works as a suction to pull any mosquitoes that land in the water up into a netted area. The mosquitoes are collected, processed at the health district’s environmental lab in Austintown and then shipped to a state testing facility in Columbus. Don’t worry if you haven’t seen the traps — they’re generally placed away from where parkgoers venture.

Traps collecting 50-100 mosquitoes are considered a good collection, as the state needs a vial of more than 20 mosquitoes to test for the virus.

So far, there have been no reported human cases of West Nile Virus in the Valley — in fact, there has only been one human case in the state so far this year. The key to keeping this number low is prevention — this means wearing bug spray when you go outdoors in areas mosquitoes may frequent. Another tip: wear long sleeves and light-colored clothing. If you happen to forget to spray before you go, Masters has placed posts around area parks that offer bug spray, alcohol wipes, and tweezers — in case of ticks.

The virus in mosquitoes can be spread across the area through an intermediate organism, which is usually a bird but can also be a horse. Masters said that when a bird is bitten by a mosquito with West Nile virus, that bird now has West Nile.

“Now every other mosquito that bites that bird can then get West Nile and carry it and transmit it into humans,” he explained.

Humans are considered a “dead-end organism,” which means that even if we are bitten by an infected mosquito, if an uninfected bug later bites us, the disease cannot be transmitted back to that insect, leading to the spread.

Masters says West Nile in humans may go undetected if people are either asymptomatic or chalk up the symptoms to something else. Human cases are reported when people go to their primary care physician and exhibit symptoms that prompt their doctor to test for mosquito-borne illness. If a test comes back positive, doctors are required to report it to the state, as well as the public health district in the county where it occurred.

When looking at the numbers, it’s important to consider the number of samples submitted per district along with the percentage that test positive. For example, if a district submitted only one sample — and that sample came back positive — its percentage would show 100%, which is not accurate for all the mosquitoes in that area. He says the best method to avoid skewed data is to look at all the data comprehensively.

Another important note is that there are 53 agencies conducting the tests in the state — not everywhere is encompassed. It covers about 40 of Ohio’s 88 counties. Masters says not all counties are able to conduct tests, either due to funding or staffing shortages.

In the Valley, the number of mosquitoes testing positive is slightly above average, but not at the level it reached during what the health district considered an “outbreak” in 2012 due to the sheer number of mosquitoes testing positive.

L.A. County Department of Public Health officials are investigating two sites in Los Angeles the man visited while infectious, according to a news release. Public spaces where others may have been exposed to the infection are LAX and the Hilton Los Angeles Airport, at 5711 W. Century Blvd.

The person landed July 5 at LAX; the exact time and flight information were still being investigated, according to the department. The infected individual was at the Hilton from 7:30 p.m. July 5 until checking out at 1 p.m. July 7.

Individuals who were at these locations on these days are urged by the department to monitor potential symptoms for at least three weeks. Symptoms include high fever, coughs, or red, watery eyes, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. They're also urged to confirm their MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination status. Those who have not been immunized are at higher risk of infection.

As The Times reported last month, the U.S. is in the midst of itslargest outbreak of measles in decades, with California already reporting more cases of the disease than in all of last year.

As outbreaks ramp up within the U.S. and internationally, the release said, summer travel can heighten exposure and transmission levels.

“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can linger in the air and on surfaces, making it easy to spread, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer. “A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure.""

The department encouraged all residents to review their immunization records, contact their healthcare provider about potential exposure — especially if they are pregnant or have a weakened immune system — and avoid large gatherings if symptoms arise.

Davis said, however, that the most effective preventive measure against measles is immunization. “The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine,” he said.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sudans-islamists-plot-post-war-071252030.html,2025-07-25 08:00:00,Sudan's Islamists plot post-war comeback by supporting army,"KHARTOUM/PORT SUDAN (Reuters) -The Islamist movement toppled in Sudan's uprising in 2019 could support an extended period of army rule as it eyes a political comeback after deploying fighters in the country's war, according to some of its leading members.

In his first media interview in years, Ahmed Haroun, chairman of the former ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and one of four Sudanese wanted by the International Criminal Court, told Reuters that he foresaw the army staying in politics after the war, and that elections could provide a route back to power for his party and the Islamist movement connected to it.

More than two years of war between Sudan's army and the RSF has caused waves of ethnic killings, famine and massive displacement, drawing in foreign powers and creating what the United Nations has called the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.

While the RSF remains entrenched in its western stronghold of Darfur and parts of the south and there is no sign of a stop to the fighting, the army has made major advances in recent months, gains that Islamist operatives say they helped bring about.

Army leaders and former regime loyalists have played down their relationship, wary of the unpopularity of ousted ex-leader Omar al-Bashir and his NCP allies. But the army's recent advances have allowed the Islamist movement to entertain a return to a national role, according to accounts from seven of the movement's members and six military and government sources.

The NCP is rooted in Sudan's Islamist movement, which was dominant in the early Bashir era during the 1990s when the country hosted Osama bin Laden, but has long abandoned hardline ideology in favour of amassing power and wealth.

The movement's resurgence could cement the reversal of Sudan's pro-democracy uprising that began in late 2018, while complicating the country's ties with regional players suspicious of Islamist influence - including hardening a split with the powerful United Arab Emirates.

In a sign of the trend, several Islamists and their allies have been appointed since last month to the cabinet of Kamil Idris, the technocratic new prime minister named in May by the army.

In response to a request for comment from Reuters, a representative for Sudan's army leadership said, ""some Islamist leaders may want to use the war to return to power, but we say categorically that the army does not ally or coordinate with any political party and does not allow any party to interfere.""

'ARMY IN POLITICS'

Haroun, speaking to Reuters late at night from a hideaway without electricity in northern Sudan, said the NCP foresaw a hybrid governing structure in which the army retained sovereign control ""until all threats are removed"", while elections brought in civilians to run the government.

""We have taken a strategic decision to not return to power other than by the ballot box after the war,"" Haroun, a Bashir ally who escaped from prison at the start of the conflict, said in the interview in late April.

""The Western model is not practical in Sudan,"" he said. ""We must develop a model for the role of the army in politics given fragile security and foreign greed, as this won't be the first or last war in the country.""

A senior army officer suggested that a transitional period run exclusively by the army prior to elections ""would not be brief.""

Haroun, wanted by the ICC for alleged involvement in war crimes and genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s -- charges he dismisses as political -- suggested a referendum to choose which army officer would lead the country.

The revival of Islamist factions began before the outbreak of the war in April 2023, during a period when a transition towards civilian rule was veering off course.

The factions had established deep roots in Sudan's ruling apparatus and in the army during Bashir's three decades in power. When army commander General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who became head of Sudan's ruling council shortly after Bashir's overthrow in 2019, staged a coup two years later, he drew on their support.

The RSF participated in the coup but was suspicious of the Islamists, and as the RSF and the army moved to protect their interests ahead of another planned transition, tensions erupted into warfare.

The RSF quickly seized most of the capital, Khartoum, and made other advances, before the army started to claw back ground, extending its control over eastern and central Sudan.

FIGHTERS

An NCP document shared with Reuters by a senior Islamist official points to a major role for Islamist networks since early on in the fighting.

In the document, Islamist operatives lay out their activities to party leaders, taking credit for directly contributing between 2,000 and 3,000 fighters to the army's war effort over the first year of the conflict.

They also take credit for training hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilians who answered an army call for public mobilisation, of whom more than 70,000 joined operations - a move that greatly bolstered the army's diminished ground forces, according to three military sources from the army or aligned with it.

The military sources put estimates of fighters directly linked to the NCP at about 5,000, mainly serving in ""special forces"" units that have made some of the largest gains for the army, particularly in Khartoum.

Other Islamist-trained combatants are serving in an elite, re-constituted unit belonging to the general intelligence service, according to Islamist fighters and military sources.

Army sources and Haroun said Islamist factions held no power over the army. Haroun also said he doubted the veracity of the document seen by Reuters and claims of thousands of NCP-linked troops fighting alongside the army, without elaborating.

But he acknowledged that it was ""no secret that we support the army in response to the commander-in-chief's call, and to ensure our survival"".

Burhan has said repeatedly he would not allow the outlawed NCP back to power, whilst enabling the return of Islamist civil servants including to such high-level roles as foreign minister and minister of cabinet affairs.

The RSF has played up the Islamist connection as the army has minimised it. ""The Islamists are the ones who set off this war in order to return to power once again, and they are the ones managing this war,"" said Mohamed Mukhtar, an advisor to the RSF's leadership.

Two military officers familiar with the issue said Burhan was balancing a desire not to cede influence to political figures with his need for military, bureaucratic, and financial support from the Islamist network.

FOREIGN ALLIES

The Sudanese Islamist movement has long given members military training, including in what was known under Bashir as the reservist Popular Defence Force (PDF).

During the war, semi-independent Islamist units have emerged, most prominently the al-Baraa Ibn Malik brigade, named after an early Islamic figure.

One of its leaders, 37-year-old engineer Owais Ghanim, told Reuters he had been wounded three times, participating in crucial battles to break the siege on army bases in the capital earlier this year.

Under army orders, members of the brigade have access to light arms, artillery, and drones, he said.

""We do not fight for the Islamists to return to power, we fight to push back the (RSF) aggression,"" said Ghanim. ""After Islamists' participation in the war, I expect they will return via elections.""

Rights monitors have accused the brigade of extrajudicial killings in newly re-captured parts of Khartoum, accusations Ghanim denied.

Army leaders have said the brigade and other groups will be integrated into the army after the war, to avoid a repeat of what happened with the RSF, which the armed forces developed to fight an insurgency in Darfur under Bashir.

Military sources say that during the war, senior Islamist figures have also used long-standing ties with countries like Iran, Qatar, and Turkey to help the army secure weapons. Haroun said he could neither confirm nor deny this.

Any further alignment with those countries, and the expanded influence of the Islamists within Sudan, could strain relations with the United States and further antagonise the UAE, which helped the army and RSF oust Bashir and has sought to roll back political Islam internationally.

The army cut diplomatic ties with the UAE earlier this year, accusing it of being the RSF's biggest supporter, a charge the Gulf state denies.

""The UAE strongly rejects the allegations that it is supplying weaponry to any party involved in the ongoing conflict,"" the Emirati foreign ministry said in a statement.

""Sudan risks once again becoming a fertile breeding ground for radical ideologies and terrorist organizations,"" it added, calling for a lasting ceasefire.

The Iranian and Turkish foreign ministries and the Qatari international media office did not respond to requests for comment.

Major shift coming to the Northeast,"A weak push of cool air will broke the heat surge in the Northeast this past weekend and will be followed by a much bigger outbreak of cool air this week from the Great Lakes to New England and the mid-Atlantic, AccuWeather meteorologists say.

A massive bulge in the jet stream allowed some cool air to seep southward this weekend in New England. High temperatures were shaved by 10-20 degrees Fahrenheit.

Through the middle of the week, hot and humid conditions will return to the Northeast with daily high temperatures well above average.

Along the Interstate 95 corridor, records are expected to be challenged each day. The nights will provide little relief for those looking for a break from the heat as overnight lows only dip into the upper 70s.

Thecore of extreme heat will stay primarily in the Southeast states through midweek,yet the regime of very warm to hot and humid conditions occuring across the Northeast will favor thunderstorms. Some of the thunderstorms that rumble from the northern tier of the Plains through the Great Lakes region are likely to be severe.

As the core of the heat shifts westward to the Plains and Rockies, cooler air from central Canada will have an easy time moving southward to the Great Lakes and especially the Northeast states.

With the big cool push later this week, locations such as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh should experience temperatures slashed by 10-20 degrees. Places in northern New England and New York may get some nights where temperatures dip into the 40s and even the upper 30s.

The end result could be at least a few days when temperatures hover several degrees below the historical average for late July and early August. Typical highs range from the upper 70s and low 80s in northern New England to near 90 around the Chesapeake Bay.

Humidity levels will be slashed significantly as well across New England and the mid-Atlantic.

West Nile virus has been found in mosquito pools in six counties: Beadle, Brown, Brookings, Lincoln, Minnehaha and Sully.

Nationwide, 15 states had reported a total of49 cases of West Nile virusin 2025 as of July 15, a day before South Dakotareported its first case.

West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is most commonly spread to people when they are bitten by an infected mosquito.

There isn't a vaccine to prevent West Nile virus, but most people infected don't feel sick. However, about one in five people develop a fever and other symptoms, and about one out of 150 people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness.

The South Dakota Department of Health says to take the following precautions to prevent mosquito bites and West Nile virus:

Apply mosquito repellents to clothes and exposed skin, and limit exposure by wearing pants and long sleeves in the evening.

Limit time outside between dusk and midnight, when mosquitoes are most active.

Remove standing water, which provides mosquitoes with a breeding ground. Routinely change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes, and drain water from flowerpots and other garden containers.

Support local mosquito control efforts.

Honduras' health ministry confirmed two deaths from the virus this week, among patients with underlying health conditions, bringing the country's total in 2025 to six.

""We have already surpassed last year's infection limit; there are currently five people admitted to Hospital Escuela with suspected COVID-19,"" said the head of Health Surveillance, Lorenzo Pavon.

Official data showed that from January to July last year, 596 COVID-19 cases were reported, while this year 654 cases have been recorded in the same period.

The temporary measures, which took effect on Thursday, make masks obligatory in hospitals, airports, shopping centers, banks, schools, public transport, and other enclosed or crowded spaces. The government also ordered temporary work-from-home for state institutions.

Authorities are urging the public to complete their COVID-19 and influenza vaccination schedules and to seek medical advice for respiratory symptoms. Frequent hand washing and the use of antibacterial gel continue to be recommended measures.

Officials also warned that they will maintain monitoring of variants and will reinforce public information campaigns. The Ministry of Health reiterated that it will continuously evaluate the epidemiological situation and warned that the measures could be expanded if the number of infections continues to rise.

(KGET) — SEIU 521 put out a statement expressing concerns and frustration over Kern County’s latest response to federal and state funding cuts, which includes plans to reduce its public health services and lay off 27 health care workers.

Suzanne McWhorter, a Kern County Public Health nurse and a member of SEIU 521 who the statement was attributed to, said her clinic in Shafter is being shut down and she is being forced to relocate away from her town.

Communities like Lost Hills, Wasco and Buttonwillow are now left without health care and resources, McWhorter said in the statement.

“Once again, rural areas are being sacrificed and left playing second fiddle to Bakersfield,” said McWhorter.

McWhorter also showed concern about the infection rate of sexually transmitted diseases in Kern County, which was around28% above the state and national average.

McWhorter then accused the Kern County Board of Supervisors of “sitting on over$70 million in restricted public health funds” and that they’re refusing to use that funding to make up for the gap created by Congressman David Valadao’s votes to slash public services.

“These are funds that Kern County has received from the state and federal government, which were not spent and instead were saved for a ‘rainy day,’” McWhorter said in the statement. “What are they waiting for — another COVID outbreak?”

17 News has reached out to the county for comment.

In the board of supervisors agenda for the meeting scheduled for Tuesday, the Kern County Public Health Department said it had to reduce several services and is looking to cut more in the future due to the lack of funding from the state and federal level.

County officials also blamed Senate Bill 525, which increased California health care workers’ minimum wage to $21.

The public hearing on the reduction of public health services in Kern County is scheduled for July 29.

According to Orban, the adoption of the EU's record-breaking budget requires unanimity. ""And until we get our backlog of money, there will be no new European budget. We will bring it home, and we will not make any concessions on our sovereignty,"" he said.

Approximately €9.5 billion in COVID-19 recovery funding and €8.4 billion in cohesion funds make up the frozen funds by Brussels over persisting concerns about Hungary's democratic backsliding.

Brussels and Budapest over the years have been at loggerheads on a range of issues, most recently that of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the situation has been made worse by the financial issue.

Orbán accuses the European Commission of ""financial blackmail"" and meddling in domestic matters due to its reasons for freezing the funds.

Hungary previously unblocked about €10.2 billion of the frozen funds following the adoption of legislation aimed at reducing political meddling in its courts and strengthening judicial independence. However, a complaint was filed by the European Parliament against the EU Commission for its controversial decision to release the €10.2 billion ahead of a crucial summit.

Some €18 billion remains frozen, with no signs or indication of progress, but in front of a large audience on Saturday, Orban vowed to get the EU funds.

The Commission's landmark €2 trillion long-term budget for 2028–2034 emphasises defence and economic competitiveness. For it to pass, it requires unanimous agreement among member states and must also be backed by Parliament, by a majority of its component members.

In his speech in Tusványos on Saturday, Viktor Orbán said that the election of US President Donald Trump has helped the world to avoid a third world war for the time being, but the chances of its outbreak are still increasing.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/measles-arrived-santa-fe-county-035900728.html,2025-07-27 16:00:00,Measles arrived in Santa Fe County this week. Now what?,"The day Myrna Barbee-Lee had been dreading for months arrived Tuesday, when the state Department of Health confirmed a case of measles in Santa Fe County.

As Santa Fe Public Schools’ lead nurse, Barbee-Lee oversees a staff of nearly 50 registered nurses and nurse aides, promoting well-being at schools across the district and ensuring compliance with New Mexico’s school vaccination requirements.

Since the start of New Mexico’s measles outbreak in February, Barbee-Lee has been watching measles cases creep northward — from the southeastern corner of the state to Sandoval County to San Juan County. As of Thursday, the disease had resulted in 96 cases, seven hospitalizations and one death, with the most recent case occurring in an unvaccinated Santa Fe County child under 10 following international travel.

Though it may be little comfort to Santa Feans concerned about the virus, the spread of measles is largely behaving as expected, with a “long tail” of sporadic cases like the one detected locally this week, said Dr. Chad Smelser, a medical epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health.

Transmission within the state has mostly died down, Department of Health data shows; only 15 of the 96 cases were contagious more than 42 days ago, meaning it’s very unlikely they’ve resulted in additional infections. But outbreaks ongoing elsewhere New Mexico, first in Texas and now in Chihuahua, Mexico, have likely contributed to cases in New Mexico, Smelser said.

As a result, he added, “We could always get another introduction.”

For Barbee-Lee, measles’ introduction in Santa Fe County wasn’t a surprise — but it still brought nerves.

“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses on Earth, and I’m worried about the potential health ramifications for children, and adults, too, in our community,” she said.

Rate of New Mexicans over 18 with at least 2 measles shots

Rate of New Mexicans over 18 with at least two measles shots.

Nobody has a crystal ball to see the future of measles in New Mexico, but Smelser anticipated it’ll likely look similar to the recent pattern of cases.

“What I imagine [what] we will see for the weeks, maybe months, to come are sporadic cases, and what we are going to work hard to do is prevent, when we do have a case, further spread in our communities,” he said.

He added the “best way” for ordinary people to help prevent the spread is to ensure they’ve received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization schedule recommends a first dose of the MMR vaccine around a child’s first birthday and the second when a child is 4 to 6 years old. The CDC also recommends the MMR vaccine for all adults who lack documentation of vaccination or lack evidence of immunity, with a few exceptions for pregnant, immunocompromised and some HIV-positive people.

One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles while two doses are 97% effective, according to the CDC.

And while cases may be sporadic, heightened vigilance of the disease — by health care providers and patients — hasn’t gone away, Smelser said.

“We’re responding to calls every day from providers, the general public, other states, etc., who are asking us questions about measles or are worried about a particular illness,” he said.

With Santa Fe Public Schools set to open campuses in just a few weeks, Barbee-Lee and her staff are certainly on the lookout.

“Anybody with a rash of an unknown origin should not be coming to school, especially if there’s a fever,” she said.

While school nurses may be best known for handing out ice packs to injured students, they also play an important role in upholding New Mexico’s school immunization requirements — which for the 2025-26 school year include two doses of the MMR vaccine by age 4½.

Part of that work is ensuring families have easy access to vaccines, Barbee-Lee said. The district, for instance, hosts its own federally funded childhood vaccine clinic with appointments available for no-cost vaccinations. While that responsibility would typically transfer to the state Department of Health, the clinic remained open all summer this year.

“Our nursing staff spend thousands of hours reaching out to families and helping them to reduce barriers to getting vaccinated. ... We want to do everything we can to make these lifesaving immunizations accessible to all people in our communities,” Barbee-Lee said.

Santa Fe Public Schools nurses also check each student’s immunization record to determine whether they are in compliance with the state’s school vaccination requirements. New students must achieve immunization compliance to start the new school year. Existing students must receive the required immunizations by November or they could be disenrolled.

In New Mexico, parents can file for a religious or medical exemption to the required vaccines, an annual process that involves submitting a certificate from a medical professional or an affidavit from a religious official or parent.

Currently, Santa Fe Public Schools students are just under the 95% threshold for communitywide immunity, with certain schools having more exemptions than others, Barbee-Lee said.

“Since 2019, we’ve seen a decline in the number of students who are coming to school fully vaccinated,” she said. “We’ve seen an increase in the number of people seeking exemptions, and certainly that’s a part of the reason why we are where we are right now.”

Barbee-Lee added, “We don’t necessarily have that 95% in every population or every little pocket of our communities, and that makes a big difference.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sir-david-nabarro-physician-led-154933106.html,2025-07-27 17:15:00,"Sir David Nabarro, physician who led the UN response to ebola and was the WHO’s envoy for Covid-19","Sir David Nabarro, who has died aged 75, was a British physician who led the world’s response to some of the most serious health crises of recent years, including ebola and Covid.

During 17 years spent with the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organisation (WHO), Nabarro took on matters of food security and nutrition, malaria, Aids, avian and human flu and climate change.

In addition he helped coordinate the WHO’s response to the Indian earthquake and tsunami of 2004, oversaw the UN’s response to the cholera epidemic in Haiti, and was stationed in the Canal Hotel in Baghdad in 2003 when a truck bomb exploded outside, killing 23 people, including the UN’s Special Representative in Iraq,Sérgio Vieira de Mello.

However, on his appointment as UN special envoy on ebola in August 2014, following an outbreak of the disease in West Africa, he admitted that while he had worked as a public health doctor for 35 years, he had “never encountered a public health crisis like this in my life”.

The epidemic is believed to have begun in December 2013 with the death of a two-year-old boy in a remote area of Guinea, but was not recognised until March 2014, by which time it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. In every one of 33 previous outbreaks of the disease, public health measures had proved able to contain it, so it took until July, when ebola had spread to the capital cities of the three countries affected, for alarm bells to ring.

By August when the WHO declared an international public health emergency, the situation was truly alarming. The number of people falling sick was doubling every three weeks; facilities were completely overloaded; hospitals were closing and mortuaries were full. Nabarro recalled that, with international airlines withdrawing services to West Africa, “there was a sense not just of despair but of abandonment”.

Nabarro galvanised a co-ordinated international response which rapidly turned the tide against the disease. “The world turned from disbelief to concern, to action, to total involvement,” he recalled. “Within months, we saw the numbers of cases starting to decline, mostly because people themselves took over their destiny and owned the response.” In January 2016 the affected countries were declared ebola-free.

Nabarro believed that the international community had learnt important lessons from the epidemic and would be better prepared in future. But as he went on to observe in 2021 in an interview with NPR, there had been a “funny shift” in world politics between 2015, when he was working on ebola, and 2020 when he was appointed WHO special envoy on the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of agreeing to co-operate, he found that world leaders were “just no longer apparently able to work together and deal with this problem through a global response”.

Nabarro became a critic of the sort of repeated lockdown measures adopted by some governments in response to recurring outbreaks, advising that such draconian measures should only be used to “take the heat out of the system when things are really bad”, but not as a primary response because of the damage caused to economic and social life.

“We just couldn’t understand why so many countries were see-sawing between what was sometimes called freedom and lockdown,” he told an interviewer later. “That is not the way. You keep your number of cases down by having really good surveillance and detection and isolation.”

By the beginning of 2022, with scientists identifying a pattern of three- or four-monthly surges of the virus, Nabarro concluded that the world would simply have to get used to living with Covid. “The goal we are aiming for,” he told the BBC, “is a situation where this virus is present, but life is organised so that it is not disrupted.” But, he added, “we need to be humble, this virus is continuing to evolve and we’re never quite sure that we know exactly where it’s going to go next.”

David Nunes Nabarro was born on August 26 1949 to John (later Sir John) Nabarro, an eminent physician and endocrinologist (and cousin of the flamboyant Conservative MP Sir Gerald Nabarro), and his wife Joan, née Cockrell, also a doctor.

After education at Oundle School, he spent a gap year as a community service volunteer in York, during which he was the subject of a BBC documentary about volunteers. He then read animal physiology and biochemistry at Worcester College, Oxford, staying on to read medicine before completing his clinical training at University College Hospital, London, and qualifying as a physician in 1973.

After brief stints working as a medical officer in northern Iraq for Save the Children (SCF), and for the NHS in Britain, from 1976 to 1978 he worked as a district child health officer in east Nepal. He then moved to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, qualifying in public health, and in 1982 was seconded back to SCF as regional manager in South Asia, covering India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

In 1985 he was appointed senior lecturer in International Community Health at the University of Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Four years later he moved to Nairobi as a strategic adviser for health and population in East Africa for the Overseas Development Administration. The following year he returned to London as the ODA’s chief health and population adviser, moving on to become director of human development in 1997.

He stayed in this role until he moved to the World Health Organisation, a specialised agency of the UN, in 1999.

On the afternoon of August 19 2003 Nabarro was attending a meeting with colleagues in the Canal Hotel, the UN’s headquarters in Baghdad, on the floor below the suite of Special Representative Sérgio Vieira de Mello, when the hotel was largely destroyed by a devastating truck bomb.

Although he and his colleagues were hit by shards of flying glass they managed to make their way out of the building to a tiny lawn where, he recalled, they found “people dying and dead… people with cuts, people with whole sides of their faces off because of glass. There was a guy with a [metal] pole into his head that went… right through, who was just talking but who was obviously dying. And there was screaming and moaning.”

Nabarro himself had been hit in the neck by glass and some colleagues had sustained more serious injuries, but they found some first-aid kits and in the 20 or 30 minutes it took for outside help to arrive, they did what they could to assist the injured.

It was only later that he learnt of the extent of the damage and the deaths of many close UN colleagues. Yet he took issue with the observation in one obituary of Sérgio Vieira de Mello that “evil triumphed”.

“It is my view,” he said, “that it is not so much evil, it’s actually ignorance, that the people who do this kind of stuff have no understanding at all of what a man like Sérgio … what these people, and their Iraqi colleagues… what they stand for… They just don’t know about absolute goodness. Because if they did, they’d never, ever think of killing these kinds of persons.”

In 2017 Nabarro was nominated by the British government to succeed Margaret Chan as director-general of the WHO but came second to Tedros Adhanom. He then became a special envoy for the organisation. In 2018 he was appointed professor and co-director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.

As an employer he insisted on high standards – at his daily 9am meetings the doors were shut on the dot and locked to latecomers – but was well-liked by colleagues.

Nabarro’s awards for his public health work included the 2015 Helen Keller Humanitarian Award. In 2018 he shared the World Food Prize (often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Agriculture) with Lawrence Haddad. He was appointed CBE in 1992 and knighted KCMG in 2023.

He is survived by his wife Flo and by five children.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/california-dairy-farmers-230-million-100000558.html,2025-07-28 10:30:00,California dairy farmers got millions to cover bird flu losses. Critics say that's part of the problem,"The federal government has paid California dairy farms more than $230 million to subsidize losses in milk production resulting from bird flu, records show, an amount that the dairy industry expects to climb higher as more claims for damages are processed.

The H5N1 bird flu has swept through more than 75% of California’s 1,000 dairy farms since August 2024,sickening cattleand leading to steep dropoffs in milk production.

Farmers were able to get relief under a U.S. Department of Agriculture program known as the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program, or ELAP. The program usually provides assistance for farmers impacted by wildfires, drought and flooding but was opened up for dairy farmers last year as bird flu beganravaging their cows.

U.S. Department of Agriculture records show that 644 payments were made to 359 California dairy farms between November 2024 and June 2025 totaling $231 million. The average per farm payment was about $645,000, and ranged from $2,058 to the Pereira Dairy Farm, in Visalia, to $4.4 million to Channel Islands Dairy Farm, in Corcoran.

Those payments are expected to go much higher, however, as more claims are submitted and processed. Many of the payments issued in May and June were for outbreaks in 2024, suggesting there are more to come.

The relief payments were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by Farm Forward, a nonprofit group that advocates against factory farming. The group asserts that the subsidies help prop up industrial-scale dairy operations that perpetuate the spread of bird flu.

""These are mega industrial operations that are fueling an outbreak,” said Andrew deCoriolis, Farm Forward’s executive director. ""Bird flu spreads in exactly the kinds of environments that we're paying to preserve.""

Anja Raudabaugh, the chief executive of the industry's largest state trade group, Western United Dairies, said the payments have ""ensured our dairy communities andtheir workersstay employed and healthy. Until we get approval of a dairy cow vaccine, weathering this storm has only been possible with the assistance of the milk loss payments.""

Jonathan Cockroft, managing partner of Channel Islands Dairy Farms, said while the payments helped with the roughly 30% drop in milk production his farm experienced, his losses exceed the $4 million he received.

He said the virus caused cows to abort their pregnancies, and often prevented them from getting pregnant again. A dairy cow that doesn't give birth doesn't produce milk. In other cases, he said the udders were so scarred by the disease that the cows were unable to produce milk at levels prior to infection.

""There's a whole other version I'm not sure the public understands, which is the huge impact on reproduction,"" he said.

He also noted many animals died — especially when theoutbreak first hit last fall, and the newness of it combined with the blazing heat of the Central Valley felled 10% to 15% of many California herds.

Joey Airoso, a dairy farmer in Tipton, received a $1.45-million subsidy for an outbreak at his farm last October.

He said the outbreak has cost him more than $2 million ""just on milk income and that does not include the over $250,000 of extra care costs"" required to treat cows with medicines, extra staffing and veterinary consultations.

And it doesn't cover the cost of the cows that died — which can't produce milk or be sold for meat. The average dairy cow costs about $3,500, Cockroft said.

Jay Van Rein, a spokesperson for California's Department of Food and Agriculture, said the loss payments are ""the most realistic way for producers to recover and to avoid huge disruptions in the food supply of these products.""

USDA officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but a former top USDA official who left the agency in January said it was important to provide dairy farmers relief once the agency identified H5N1 bird flu in a handful of Texas herds in March 2024. By then the disease had been spreading for weeks, if not months, making containment to one state impossible.

""This was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we knew that we were going to need to support producers, and we knew that the quicker we could get some assistance out to them to help them test, the better off we were going to be, and the faster we'd be able to bring the infection under control,"" he said.

Farm Forward’s DeCoriolis and others, however, say these programs perpetuate an agricultural industry designed around containing hundreds, if not thousands, of genetically similar animals into confined lots —veritable playgrounds for a novel virus.He also noted the federal relief programs don't come with any strings attached, such as incentives for disease mitigation and/or biosecurity.

Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Canada, said handing out subsidies to farms without trying to understand or investigate the practices they are using to quash the disease is a mistake.

""What are they doing on the farms to prevent reinfection?"" she said.

The USDA payments were based on a per cow milk production losses over a four-week period. According to Farm Forward's data, several farms received more than one subsidy. While roughly half received just one payment, 100 farms received two payments, 58 received three, 19 received four and two received six separate payments.

At one farm in Tulare County, four USDA payments were submitted once a month between November 2024 and February 2025. At another, payments stretched from December 2024 to May 2025.

Rasmussen said the multiple payments most likely stemmed depending on specific circumstances at the dairies involved.

Cockroft of the Channel Islands Dairy said he and other farmers have seen waves of reinfection and milk tests that remain positive for months on end. He said he knew of a farm that was in quarantine for nine months.

When herds are quarantined, animals are not allowed to be transferred on or off site. In California, a farm is under quarantine for 60 days after initial virus detection. It can't move out of quarantine until tests show its milk is virus-free — for three weeks in a row.

Van Rein, the state agriculture spokesperson, said the average time under quarantine is 103 days. He said that of the 1,000 herds in California, 940 are not under quarantine; 715 of those had previously been infected and released from quarantine.

A quarantined farm can still sell milk, however, even if the milk tests positive. Pasteurization has been shown to kill the virus.

The relief payments are another sign of how the U.S. government supports the agricultural industry, which is considered by some to be vital to the national interest.

""We've decided politically that this is an industry that we want to support, that was hit by something that obviously wasn't their fault, and we're going to help them, because it was a disastrous thing that hit the industry,"" said Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. ""If we thought about these payments as we're using our tax money to help somebody who's in need, because their family is poor, that's not the case.""

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fearing-medicaid-coverage-loss-parents-110042381.html,2025-07-28 12:15:00,"Fearing Medicaid coverage loss, some parents rush to vaccinate their kids","For two decades, Washington, D.C., pediatricianLanre Falusihas counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects, and timing. But this year, she said, the conversations have changed.

“For the first time, I’m having parents of newborns ask me if their baby will still be able to get vaccines,” Falusi said.

Throughout the country, pediatricians say anxious parents are concerned about access to routine childhood immunizations, especially those with children on Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families and people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4 in 10 children in the U.S.

“It really became an issue when RFK Jr. stepped into the role of HHS secretary,” saidDeborah Greenhouse, a pediatrician in South Carolina.

The concern accelerated after the shake-up of a key Centers for Disease Control and Preventionvaccine advisory bodyin June, raising fears that millions of American families could soon have to pay out-of-pocket for shots now covered by their health insurance.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the panel responsible for recommending which shots are included in the nation’s adult and childhood immunization schedules.

Kennedy replaced the panelists with new members aligned with his views,prompting alarmamong medical professionals and public health experts.

“People should be worried about what’s going to happen to the availability of vaccines for children,” said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurersare requiredto cover all ACIP-recommended vaccines. States and other jurisdictions use the childhood vaccine schedule to set immunization requirements for schoolchildren. ACIP’s recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, a CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations to low-income and uninsured children. Half of children in the U.S. are eligible for the VFC program.

If the new ACIP members withdraw support for a particular vaccine and the CDC director agrees, Tolbert said, the consequences would be immediate. “It would automatically affect what is covered and therefore which vaccines are available to children on Medicaid,” she said.

Health insurance companies have not yet said how they would alter coverage, but Tolbert said such a move would open the door for private insurers to refuse to cover the vaccine.

Pediatricians worry about a future where parents might have to choose — pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket for shots or leave their kids unprotected.

Thehealth insurance industry group AHIPsaid that health plans “continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations.”

Pediatricians say news about President Donald Trump’s new budget law, which is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over the next decade, also prompted questions from parents.

While parents may be worried about losing their Medicaid, the law doesn’t mention vaccines or change eligibility or benefits for children’s Medicaid, Tolbert said. But less federal funding means states will have to make decisions about who is covered and which services are offered.

To raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked for other spending, such as education or corrections; or, more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.

“And they may do that by cutting eligibility for optional populations or by cutting services that are optional, or by reducing payments to providers in the form of provider rates,” Tolbert said. “It’s unclear how this will play out, and it will likely look different across all states.”

In May, Kennedy announced in apost on Xthat the CDC is no longer recommending the covid-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The moveprompted a lawsuitby the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician groups that seeks to freeze Kennedy’s directive.

In June, the new ACIP members appointed by Kennedy voted to recommend that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines with thimerosal, a preservative rarely used in some flu vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, haverallied against thimerosalfor decades, alleging links to autism despite no evidence of any association.

“There is no cause for concern,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement. “As Secretary Kennedy has stated, no one will be denied access to a licensed vaccine if they choose to receive one.”

“When the ACIP committee met last month, they reaffirmed that flu vaccines will remain accessible and covered, and they emphasized safety by ensuring these vaccines are mercury-free,” Hilliard wrote. “The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program continues to provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost for eligible children when the parent, provider, and patient decide vaccination is appropriate. Medicaid will continue to reimburse the administration fee.”

But the possibility that a vaccine could be restricted or no longer covered by insurance is already changing how parents approach immunization. In Falusi’s practice, parents are scheduling appointments to coincide precisely with their child’s eligibility, sometimes making appointments the same week as their birthdays.

Melissa Mason, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has evaluated some patients who contracted measles during the multistate outbreak that started in neighboring Texas.

She’s concerned that any new limitations on access or reimbursement for childhood vaccines could lead to even more preventable illnesses and deaths.

Nationally, there have been more than 1,300 measles cases since January, including three deaths, according to the CDC. “We’re seeing this outbreak because vaccination rates are too low and it allows measles to spread in the community,” Mason said.

Children and teens account for 66% of national measles cases. Mason has begun offering the measles vaccine to infants as young as 6 months old, a full six months earlier than standard practice, though still within federal guidelines.

Last year, overall kindergartenvaccination rates fellin the U.S. At the same time, the number of children with a school vaccination exemption continued to rise.

Pertussis, or whooping cough — another disease that can be deadly to young children — is spreading.As of July 5, more than 15,100 cases had been identified in U.S. residents this year, according to the CDC.

Mason said pertussis is especially dangerous to babies too young to receive the vaccine.

For now, pediatricians are trying to maintain a sense of urgency without inciting panic.

In Columbia, South Carolina, Greenhouse used to offer families a flexible age range for routine vaccinations.

“I’m not saying that anymore,” the pediatrician said.

She now urges parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.

She described anxious parents asking whether the HPV vaccine, which helpsprevent cervical cancer, can be administered to children younger than the recommended age of 9.

“I actually had two parents today ask if their 7- or 8-year-olds could get the HPV shot,” Greenhouse said. “I had to tell them it’s not allowed.”

With the vaccine requiring multiple doses months apart, Greenhouse fears time may run out for families to get the series covered by insurance. If they have to pay out-of-pocket, she’s afraid some families may choose not to get the second dose. A second dose could costabout $300if no longer covered by insurance.

“I cannot be 100% sure what the future looks like for some of these vaccines,” Greenhouse said. “I can tell you it’s a very scary place to be.”

Kennedy’s newly appointed vaccine advisory committee is expected to hold its nextpublic meetingas soon as August.
