The clothes were colorful, the ads were provocative, and the brand marketed itself as progressive with its proud motto: “Ethically Made, Sweatshop Free.”

But behind the scenes, beneath the indie sleaze and moral posturing, the company was quietly imploding. Now, thanks toNetflix’snew documentary anthologyTrainwreck, people finally have an inside look at what brought this once billion-dollar corporation to its knees.

Here are the most shocking revelations fromThe Cult of American Apparel:

FounderDov Charneywasn’t just building a brand—he was creating a look.

Former employees say they were hired on the spot simply because of their appearance: “I’m tall and skinny,” said one. Another claimed their “hipster meets bike messenger” style got them hired. In some cases, people with no fashion background were placed in senior roles.

Yes, it’s true.

New hires reportedly received Hitachi wand vibrators as part of their employee welcome kits.

A safe working environment? Not exactly American Apparel’s thing.

Charney didn’t just have a proclivity for sexual perversion; He also loved verbally abusing his staff!

Every week, he would hold mandatory company wide calls, during which he nominated a “fool of the week”—an employee who he believed “screwed him over.”

The whole thing was basically an exercise in ritualistic shaming.

Former American Apparel employees claim that they worked insane hours.

“On one two-week period, on top of the 80 hours that I worked, there was another 120-something hours of overtime I clocked,” Carson, one of the documentary’s subjects, said.

Charney reportedly treated Robert Greene’sThe 48 Laws of Powerlike gospel.

The book outlines how to manipulate and dominate in business and life, which people claim heavily influenced Charney’s leadership style.

When the company went public in 2007, he even appointed Greene to the board

By 2014,several womenhad accused Charney of sexual harassment. However, many employees were bound by contracts that funneled complaints into private arbitration, shielding the company from public lawsuits.

The Civil rights attorneyToni Jaramilla, who was featured in the documentary, explained: “It started with one woman, then another. In doing our due diligence, we found more who had experienced the same thing.”

Following a formal investigation, Charney was ousted for sexual harassment, discrimination, and misuse of company funds.

Today, American Apparel lives on in name only. It exists as a fully online store owned by Canadian manufacturer Gildan Activewear. But the brand’s cultural relevancy has long vanished, and along with it, so too has the “cult” that once surrounded it."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/gaza-authorities-suspend-key-services-192634283.html,2025-07-13 20:30:00,Gaza authorities suspend key services due to Israeli fuel blockade,"A fuel crisis in Gaza, caused by an Israeli blockade, has forced several municipalities to suspend key services, such as waste collection and sewage treatment, threatening to exacerbate disease and suffering in the war-torn territory.

In a joint statement, the affected municipalities in central and southern Gaza said they have had to halt these services because of Israeli restrictions on the import of petrol and diesel into the coastal strip.

The statement, which was signed by the municipal authorities of Khan Younis and Rafah, among others, also said that equipment for clearing rubble could not be used due to fuel shortages, and that wells had been closed.

The authorities said their attempts to secure fuel through international organizations had proven unsuccessful.

Much of Gaza lies in ruins after over 21 months of Israeli attacks, with many Palestinians living in severely overcrowded conditions.

A group of seven UN organizations providing humanitarian aid in Gaza warned on Saturday of the catastrophic consequences of the impending fuel shortage.

""Without adequate fuel, Gaza faces a collapse of humanitarian efforts,"" said a statement issued by the organizations, which include the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and the World Health Organization.

In hospitals, the lights are already going out, maternity and intensive care units are failing and ambulances are no longer able to respond to calls, the organizations said.

They stressed that bakeries and community kitchens, which feed the sealed-off territory's starving population, also depend on fuel to operate, as do water treatment and sewage plants.

""These conditions expose families to deadly disease outbreaks and push Gaza's most vulnerable even closer to death,"" the statement said.

Israel has been waging a relentless war in Gaza against Hamas since the Palestinian Islamist group and its allies launched unprecedented attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

Israel controls all access to the Gaza Strip and has severely restricted the entry of humanitarian supplies, including fuel.

Israeli officials have repeatedly claimed that the minimum amounts of fuel required are reaching Gaza."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/recent-orleans-building-collapse-reignites-225902547.html,2025-07-15 01:00:00,Recent New Orleans building collapse reignites need for engineer,"NEW ORLEANS (WGNO) — Brick by brick, building collapses in New Orleans have become an all too regular occurrence.

Just last week, part of ahistoric buildingon St. Louis Street came crashing down.

“No one wants to see buildings collapse. Buildings collapse for lots of different reasons,” said Director of the Office of Community and Economic Development Jeffrey Schwartz.

New Orleans advocates push for bike safety following bicyclist’s death

City of New Orleans Chief Building Official Jay Dufour says the building was already being monitored by the owners.

“Trying to get them into restoring, their brick, and then it got to the point where on doing that, while they were doing it, they had you know, quite a lot of bricks fall down on the sidewalk,” said Dafour.

Collapses often result in street closures, something Councilwoman Lesli Harris says causes all sorts of other problems.

“It’s always an interruption of our city service is and luckily, nobody was injured when it happened. But I do mourn, as you said, the loss of Maypop and some other businesses that had to shutter because of this,” Harris said.

In January, the city council approved bringing in an engineer to help address building collapses. However, the job is still open six months later.

Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office autopsies paused citing air conditioning outage

Councilman Oliver Thomas believes that if a survey of the building is done it’ll show how vibration plays a part in the collapses.

“Perpetual potholes, when you have infrastructure that is so unstable. Your car has to roll over it or around it, you are creating a certain amount of vibration that permeates through the infrastructure to the buildings,” Thomas said.

Determined to find a solution, Harris says another approach is necessary to see that an engineer is hired.

“We’re going to have to take another look at that and see how much if we need to increase the RFP. If we can publicize this more widely, via social media and other means rather than what we do currently,” Harris said.

WGNO reached out to the city about the challenges of finding an engineer but has not heard back.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-ukraine-trade-drone-strikes-152601840.html,2025-07-06 15:45:00,Russia and Ukraine trade drone strikes as Kyiv signs deals to boost drone production,"Russia and Ukraine struck each other with hundreds of drones on Sunday, throwing Russian air travel in disarray, shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced deals with Western partners that would allow Kyiv to scale up drone production.

Photos circulating on social media showed crowds huddling at Russian airports including key international hubs in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as hundreds of flights were delayed or canceled due to Ukrainian drone strikes on Saturday and overnight, according to Russia’s Transport Ministry.

The flight disruptions hit Moscow’s Sheremetyevo and St. Petersburg’s main Pulkovo airports. Other airports in western and central Russia also faced disruptions.

Russian air defenses shot down 120 Ukrainian drones during the nighttime attacks, and 39 more before 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. It did not clarify how many had hit targets, or how many had been launched in total.

Early on Sunday, Ukrainian drones injured two civilians in Russia’s Belgorod region near the border, its Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

Russia pounded Kyiv last week

The Ukrainian attacks came just days after Russia pummelled Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles overnight into Friday, in what Ukrainian officials called the largest such strike since Moscow’s all-out invasion. The seven-hour onslaught killed at least two civilians, wounded dozens more and caused widespread damage, Ukraine said, while Moscowramped up its pushto capture more of its neighbor’s land.

In total, Russia launched 550 drones and missiles across Ukraine that night, according to the country’s air force. The barrages have coincided with a concerted Russian effort to break through parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where Ukrainian troops are under severe pressure.

Large-scale Russian drone strikes on Sunday injured three civilians in Kyiv and at least two in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city in the northeast, officials said. A Russian attack involving Shahed drones also targeted port infrastructure in Mykolaiv in central Ukraine, according to local Gov. Vitaliy Kim. He reported warehouses and the port’s power grid were damaged but there were no casualties.

Hours later, Russia launched a glide bomb and a drone at the front-line town of Kostyantynivka in eastern Ukraine, killing four civilians and injuring a fifth, the prosecutor’s office said. The drone struck a car in which a married couple were travelling, killing the 39-year-old woman and 40-year-old man on the spot, it said.

Ukraine seeks to ramp up drone production

Zelenskyy said on Saturday that Ukraine had inked deals with European allies and a leading U.S. defense company to step up drone production, ensuring Kyiv receives “hundreds of thousands” more this year.

Zelenskyy did not name the U.S. business in his nightly video address to Ukrainians, but said Ukraine and Denmark have also agreed to co-produce drones and other weapons on Danish soil.

His remarks came days after the U.S.paused some shipments of military aidto Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles. Ukraine’s main European backersare considering howthey can help pick up the slack. Zelenskyy said plans are afoot to build up Ukraine’s domestic arms industry, butscaling up will take time.

Ukraine has previously used homemade drones to hit high-value military targets deep inside Russia, demonstrating its capabilities and denting Moscow’s confidence. Last month,Kyiv said it destroyed more than 40 Russian planesstationed at several airfields deep inside Russia in a surprise attack.

Outmanned and outgunned, Ukraine’s army has also turned to drones to compensate for its troop shortage and shore up its defenses. While Russia hasramped up offensivesthis summer on two fronts in Ukraine, analysts say the front isn’t about to collapse.

On Friday, Zelenskyy said he had a “very important and productive” phone call that day with U.S.President Donald Trump, discussing possible joint drone production alongsideU.S-led efforts to end the war.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump described the call as “good”.

“He’s been hit very hard, as I said he would. He’s been hit very hard,” he said.

Here’s how to help flood survivors in Central Texas

Severe flooding has been reported in several counties in central Texas this weekend. In Kerr County, theKerr County Sheriff’s Officesaid 84 people have been found dead from the floods, including 56 adults and 28 children as of 2 p.m. on Monday.

The Longview Fire Department has deployed eight members from their Water Rescue Team as a part of the Texas A&M Task Force 1. The members have been in Kerrville since Friday and include one water group supervisor, one technical support specialist and a six person Swiftwater Rescue Team.

“Our members have been working in the Kerrville area since the early morning of July 4th. They were able to perform multiple rescues of people trapped in trees, vehicles and debris in some very difficult and dangerous conditions as a result of the catastrophic flooding,” the Longview Fire Department said. “They continue to work tirelessly alongside our many response partners from throughout the state and nation in support of Search and Rescue operations to locate those still missing.”

The Lufkin Fire Department deployed Engine 3 to Central Texas with captains Petty and Grace and firefighters Jernigan and Maskunas, as a part of theTIFMASprogram. The crew left just before 12 p.m. on Saturday in order to meet with other departments that are gathering together to form a strike team.

A group taking photos ahead of a wedding wound up in a local hospital after their bridal shoot was interrupted by a surprise lightning storm

North Carolina photographer Brianna Pendley, her son, bride Katie McDaniel and a friend were at Carvers Gap on Roan Mountain on Tuesday, July 1, when the storm began

""We were huddled in a small circle kinda laughing at what had just happened, then within literal milliseconds we were on the ground screaming,"" Pendley wrote on Facebook

A North Carolina photographer, her son and a soon-to-be bride ended up in the hospital after their bridal shoot was interrupted by a surprise lightning storm this week.

On Tuesday, July 1, Brianna Pendley was taking bridal photos for Katie McDaniel ahead of her wedding this month, when a thunderstorm quickly broke out at Carvers Gap on Roan Mountain, near the Tennessee border.

Pendley, who was joined by her young son Landry and a friend during the shoot, wrote onFacebookthat the group decided to head back down once they spotted rain, before it started ""violently hailing."" While in ""full-survival mode,"" the group opted to take shelter under trees.

Both Pendley and McDaniel also detailed the ordeal to NBC affiliateWCNCand ABC affiliateWSOC.

""We were huddled in a small circle kinda laughing at what had just happened, then within literal milliseconds we were on the ground screaming because lightning had struck the tree/ground that we were under,"" the photographer wrote on Facebook. ""I felt the electricity in my feet and legs, and saw smoke coming from the ground so I knew it wasn’t good.""

After seeing her son ""laid over to one side,"" the photographer and the rest of the group ran down the mountain ""covered in dirt,"" she revealed. ""Once the initial strike happened and we immediately fell to the ground, my first instinct was we got to get out of there,"" McDaniel told WCNC. ""I thought the tree was going to fall when the lightning struck it. I heard the cracking.""

""It was so quick that we literally went from standing to on the ground in the middle of a second,"" Pendley, who recalled seeing a ""very loud"" flash and ""smoke"" coming from the ground, added. ""If it would have killed us, we probably wouldn't know what happened.""

On the way down, the women and boy encountered another group on the mountain who said they ""heard the crying and screaming and were concerned,"" Pendley wrote on Facebook. During their visit to the hospital, the women and the child were told they were ""lucky to be alive because something like this normally ends in less fortunate outcomes.""

Both McDaniel and Landry sustained welts from the strike but the group was ""overall"" OK, Pendley wrote.

Pendley told WSOC that there was “no warning"" and ""no thunder"" ahead of the sudden storm. “It’s so unpredictable,” she said. “It happened like that. The storm was over in five minutes, and I don’t know if I’m going to be much of a hiker after that.”

As WCNC notes, citing the the National Lightning Safety Council, North Carolina was ranked among the top five states in terms of lightning-related deaths between 2015 and 2024.

The National Weather Serviceencourages those outside without access to shelter amid lightning to ""immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges or peaks"" and ""never shelter under an isolated tree.""

""Long story short, I won’t be trusting the weather anymore and Landry says he’s never going outside again 🥲,"" the photographer wrote on Facebook, calling it ""a beautiful bridal session turned into a long night in the hospital.""

""We are so thankful that God kept all of us safe! Trauma bonded for life and still trying to process what happened, but alive 🥴""

https://www.yahoo.com/news/ending-imperial-judiciary-104255855.html,2025-07-04 13:00:00,Ending the Imperial Judiciary,"On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered a powerful message: The job of the judiciary is to apply the Constitution and laws enacted by the peoples representatives, not to implement a judges political agenda. In delivering this message, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett humiliated ideologue Ketanji Brown Jackson, who declined to engage in legal analysis, because it was (as Jackson put it)""mind-numbingly technical.""

In decision after decision this term, the court restored jurisprudential principles to the judiciarys mission, culminating in repeated rebukes of progressive judges who use the Constitution and federal law as props to advance their political agendas. The era of liberal activist judges that began with Earl Warrens ascension to chief justice in 1953 has officially ended.

The re-emergence of the Constitution began when the court eschewed ""penumbras"" emanating from the Constitution hallucinated by Justice William O. Douglas inRoe v. Wade, returning abortion decisions to the states. Then, aunanimouscourt stopped Democrats from protecting democracy by depriving voters of the opportunity to vote for Trump. Ending the Biden administrations lawfare, a split court next explained that because the powers of the executive branch are vested in just one person, the president must have immunity to utilize the powers of the office. In other words, the courts are not the presidents boss.

Since January, activist Democrat-appointed judges committed to preserving radical left policies have repeatedly enjoined Trumps orders. Even liberal appeals courts have begun to stay or reverse the most egregious abuses involving tariffs, immigration, and government layoffs.

Last week, after U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer enjoined Trump from federalizing the California National Guard because he disagreed with Trumps prescription for quelling the violence caused by anti-ICE rioters, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit unanimouslyreversed. The panel rejected Breyers right to decide the law, facts, and policy, and reminded him (and 111 other district court judges in the Ninth Circuit) that on matters related to the National Guard, the presidents judgment stands unless it is so extreme as to be dishonest.

During the first 20 weeks of Trumps second term, the administration filed 19 emergency applications to the Supreme Court to stop district court judges who substituted their policy judgments for the presidents. In almost all cases, the administration prevailed, at least pending a complete judicial review, preserving its right to deport illegal aliens; permitting DOGE to review government spending and recommend cuts; disqualifying transgender people from military service; and allowing cuts to ideologically driven federal grants.

On its regular calendar, the Supreme Courtunanimously:held that straight white people have the same rights to be protected from discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as do so-called marginalized minorities; protected a Catholic charity threatened with loss of its tax exemption by Wisconsin for offering services to non-Catholics; and dismissed the Mexican governments effort to sue U.S. gun manufacturers for drug cartel violence.

Friday alone, the court ruled that the American judiciary is required to consider only the ""cases and controversies"" before it, and may not order nationwide injunctions; agreed parents may withdraw their children from classes that indoctrinate them in trans ideology; held that Texas may bar minors from viewing internet pornography; and strengthened Trumps powers to impose tariffs by reaffirming, in an unrelated case, that Congress can delegate power to executive agencies if it lays out the general policy, principles and boundaries.

InMahmoud v. Taylor, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that indoctrinating children in trans ideology is ""critical to our Nations civic vitality"" and overrides the First Amendment right to religious freedom. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito blasted her ""deliberately blinkered view"" that the purpose of the program at issue was to teach kindness, adding that Sotomayor ""ignores what anyone who reads these books can readily see"" - that the purpose is to advocate the use of pronouns and choice of gender as ""values and beliefs"" to be ""celebrated"" and contrary values and beliefs to be ""rejected.""

InTrump v. CASA, Inc., a case the administration may ultimately lose involving Trumps authority to end birthright citizenship, the majority held that federal courts do not have the power to grant nationwide injunctions that go beyond the specific parties and issues before them to block administration orders.

The liberal justices dissented, complaining that the limitation would allow Trump too much leeway. Apparently tired of Jacksons substituting politics for legal analysis, in her majority opinion, Barrett excoriated Jacksons dissent for being untethered to any legal doctrine, dismissively declaiming: ""We will not dwell on Justice Jacksons argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself. We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.""

When Supreme Court justices and even the Ninth Circuit use strong language to rein in activist judges, the end of the imperial judiciary is nigh.

From the evening of 3 July and throughout the night of 3-4 July, the Russianscarried outa large-scale strike with drones and ballistic missiles on the city of Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast, as well as the cities of Dnipro, Sumy, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. The main target of the strike was the capital.

Fires and damage to residential buildings were reported in six districts of the capital. As of the morning of 4 July,23 people were known to have been injured. Among them was a 10-year-old girl.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/mcso-boost-patrols-ontario-beach-214023666.html,2025-07-04 00:30:00,MCSO to boost patrols at Ontario Beach Park for 4th of July weekend,"CHARLOTTE, N.Y. (WROC) – Ahead of the holiday weekend, local law enforcement personnel are giving an update on security at Ontario Beach Park following an uptick in crime over recent months.

Whether it’s a cookout with family or a day spent at the beach, MCSO wants to remind visitors they will be out over the weekend in big numbers.

“Expect to see increased patrols and expect to see high visibility officers and deputies working together up there to make sure everyone can have a fun and safe holiday weekend,” said Deputy Brendan Hurley with MCSO.

Over the last few years, MCSO has been able to boost patrols for holidays like the 4th of July, with progress made in recruitment and reinforcement from surrounding agencies.

“We’ve been fortunate over the last couple years to be able to bolster our patrols. We’ve gotten about 50 more road patrol deputies. That hadn’t increased in several years. For us, it’s mostly about prevention. We don’t wait to wait until there is a problem,” said Deputy Hurley.

Business owners like John Kabrovski of Tropix Nightclub have previously shared concerns with News 8 over a spike in violence in Charlotte’s main district. While the area has seen improvements, he says it’s still affecting local business.

“I think what’s happened in the last few weeks and months down here has scared people. People have made their plans to go somewhere else. We’ve got to get the word out that Charlotte is a safe place to be and that the police presence is enormous. They’re here to patrol. They’re not here to give anyone a tough time. They’re here to keep the violence down and keep the trouble away,” said Kabrovski.

Various Charlotte businesses, including Tropix, will be closed on the 4th of July but plan to reopen Saturday. The change, he says, has taken effect in recent years. Ontario Beach Park will be open, and MCSO reminds the public if you see something to say something, and call 911 in the event of any emergency.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/least-3-killed-explosion-l-153848315.html,2025-07-18 23:00:00,3 L.A. County sheriff's deputies killed in explosion ID'd; investigators search Santa Monica apartment,"Three deputies were killed Friday in an explosion at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Biscailuz Center Training Academy in East L.A., the deadliest incident for the agency in more than 160 years.

Deputies with the arson explosives detail, an elite unit within the Sheriff's Department, were moving ordnance in the training center's parking lot about 7:30 a.m. when the blast occurred.

The deputies were identified Friday evening as Dets. Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus and William Osborn. They had served 19, 22 and 33 years with the department, respectively, authorities said.

The Sheriff's Department is currently investigating an apartment complex in the 800 block of Bay Street in Santa Monica in connection with the explosion, according to department spokesperson Nicole Nishida. The three deputies killed in the blast responded to a call to assist the Santa Monica Police Department at the complex on Thursday.

The explosion is being investigated as a negligent homicide, which could result in charges against the person who made or stored the device, law enforcement sources told The Times.

The Santa Monica Police Department evacuated residents from the Bay Street apartment building Friday afternoon, while authorities continue to search the location for any additional explosive material, Nishida said. The FBI and Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad are assisting with the investigation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is expected to lead a federal probe into the cause of the explosion.

""They're the best of the best,"" Sheriff Robert Luna said of the agency's special enforcement bureau. ""And the individuals who work our arson explosives detail, they have years of training. ... They are fantastic experts, and unfortunately, I lost three of them today.”

He said it will take time — possibly weeks or months — to investigate the incident.

Osborn, who joined the Sheriff's Department in 1992, was described as“one of [the] tenured bomb technicians regularly relied upon when faced with a new challenge"" in a department news release. He is survived by his wife, Det. Shannon Rincon, four sons and two daughters.

Kelley-Eklund joined the Sheriff's Department in 2006 and leaves behind his wife, Jessica Eklund, and their seven children. Prior to joining the arson explosives detail, he worked as a narcotics and murder investigator as well as a field training officer who mentored new deputies.

Lemus comes from a family of Sheriff's Department employees, including his wife, Det. Nancy Lemus; sisters Sgt. Belen Lemus, Deputy Perla Lemus and Custody Asst. Wendy Lemus; and brother-in-law Sgt. Robert Catalan. He joined the department in 2003 and was known for his ability to train fellow deputies and notable arrests involving career criminals. He leaves behind three daughters.

A grenade was recovered at the Santa Monica apartment complex Thursday, a city police officer told The Times.

Michael Kellman, who lives in the building, told The Times that a fellow tenant called the police Thursday after discovering a bag of grenades tucked away in her storage unit.

She has been living in the building for several years and believes the bag was left behind by the former occupant, he said. Authorities returned to her unit Friday to scour the apartment for any remaining explosives.

The bomb squad picks up potential explosives across the region on a daily basis, but it's a situation that's always fraught with danger because it's hard to assess the stability of materials and their age, law enforcement sources told The Times.

After the explosion, the LAPD's bomb squad responded to the scene to help render any other potential explosive materials safe. It took authorities several hours to complete the process, Luna said.

Employees told The Times they heard a massive boom around 7:30 a.m. coming from the parking lot where the sheriff's bomb squad keeps its vehicles. They heard glass shattering and screaming.

Rich Pippin, president of the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, called it the ""worst day in the history of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.""

""You never get up in the morning expecting this kind of news, never, and sadly, as often as we deal with this, it does not get easier,"" he said. ""It never gets easier. It hurts.""

Hundreds of people gathered in the street outside the East L.A. training center Friday evening for a procession to honor the fallen officers.

Three coffins draped with American flags were loaded into trucks to be transported to the L.A. County Medical Examiner around 5 p.m. A massive American flag was hoisted between two fire truck ladders for the procession to pass through, while scores of law enforcement members somberly watched.

In radio communications reviewed by The Times, a sheriff's dispatcher told units that there was an ""explosion with three down."" She later advised that a sheriff's weapons team leader said investigators should ""not approach"" the scene.

In the aftermath, officials covered the blast area with a large tarp as they collected evidence and worked to render the device safe. About 25 yards from the facility, glass was scattered across the parking lot from the windows of an SUV cruiser that were blown out by the explosion. A sheriff's helicopter circled over the area as multiple emergency vehicles streamed into the facility.

At one point, video from the scene showed a bomb technician in a blast suit approaching the site and removing some material before returning to the area where investigators were gathering evidence.

Ed Nordskog, a former member of the department’s arson explosives detail and a 34-year department veteran, said the agency's bomb and arson unit is one of the largest and busiest in the United States. The squad gets daily calls to handle military ordnance that spans from the modern era back to World War I, as well as commercial explosives, blasting dynamite from mining operations, suspicious packages and homemade or improvised items.

""All have different aspects that are dangerous,"" he said. ""It’s a job that requires at least a year of formal training to be able to work, and several years of field experience to feel fully proficient.""

Former L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told KTLA-TV Channel 5 in an interview that the arson explosives detail includes some of the agency's most experienced personnel.

""The loss is just staggering,"" he said. ""It's gonna take a while to figure out how this happened, why this happened, could it have been prevented.""

The explosion and resulting deaths sent shock waves across Los Angeles County and prompted many unanswered questions. Flags at county buildings were lowered to half-staff in mourning.

Two of the deputies who were killed were sometimes assigned to provide security at county board meetings in downtown Los Angeles, according to officials.

L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said she was ""heartbroken"" by the situation and that the entire county is grieving for the deputies and their families.

""These deputies went to work expecting to come home and they didn't,"" Barger said. ""I hope the takeaway is that we should all remember to have compassion and empathy and give law enforcement a break.""

Jason Zabala, who works for the Sheriff's Department's SWAT team and was a colleague and friend of the deputies who died Friday, echoed Luna's comments that they were the ""best of the best."" He was in shock, he said, his voice breaking as he talked about his friends.

""I can think of no greater honor, truly, than to die in the service of people,"" he said. ""That's why we sign up, and it's tragic, but I'm sure their families are proud of their service, as I am.""

The dangers of the profession aren't lost on those who wear the uniform or their families, Zabala said, but it doesn't keep them from doing their jobs.

""You do this job for a reason. You don't really think about it day to day, until something like this happens, and then you realize how dangerous it really is,"" he said. ""I know our families go through that. I know my family goes through that probably every day. But we truly love the work we do.""

Tony Meraz, a veteran sheriff's deputy who knew all three of the men killed in the explosion, said their deaths leave a void in the hearts of their friends, families and the department that will never be filled.

""All three of these men are the kind of cops that if your loved one calls 911, you want them to show up, whether it is an active shooter, a traffic collision or because your mom is lost,"" Meraz said. ""They are all gone in the blink of an eye.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said on X that he had been briefed on the explosion, and the state deployed investigative personnel from the Office of the State Fire Marshal to help determine what happened.

U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi called the situation a ""horrific incident"" in a statement Friday and asked for prayers for the deputies' families.

The Biscailuz Center Training Academy was used for deputy training from 1946 to 1984, when it was closed because of a lack of space. The 36,000-square-foot training center was renovated and reopened in 2017. The facility houses the sheriff’s special enforcement bureau and the arson explosive detail, including the bomb squad.

The explosion drew several spectators to the edge of a perimeter erected by deputies as they continued their investigation.

Luisa Lopez, an employee at Medsco, a sheet metal fabrication facility, said their machines had obscured the sound of the blast, but she became aware of the accident when authorities began racing toward the facility.

“When we heard all the noise of the police, we didn’t think anything of it because they pass [by] all the time,"" she said.

Richard Montoya, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the blast area, said he and his children were jolted by three successive explosions that shook his house. At first he thought the explosion might have been fireworks, which are common in the neighborhood after the Fourth of July.

But he said he realized it wasn't fireworks because it felt stronger, like a small earthquake.

Josh Green said officials observed water receding by 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 meters) at Haleiwa Harbor on Oahu, the state’s most populous island, an indication that tsunami waves will arrive. The waves pulling out left boats to lay on dry rock and sand. “That gave us pause,” Green said.

So far, no damage has been recorded, but it will take two to three hours of observation before authorities will be able to determine whether the event has passed, Green said.

Authorities in a number of small island nations in the South Pacific Ocean urged people to stay away from coastlines, familiarize themselves with evacuation routes and await further guidance from officials, but did not order evacuations.

Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world’s most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas.

Cautions to stay away from beaches until any wave surges passed late Wednesday were issued by officials in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands.

A tsunami hit coastal areas of Russia’s Kuril Islands and Japan’s large northern island of Hokkaido after a powerful, 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia early Wednesday. Warnings are also in place for Alaska, Hawaii and other coasts south toward New Zealand.

The Japan Meteorological Agency said a tsunami as high as 60 centimeters (2 feet) had been detected as the waves moved south along the Pacific coast from Hokkaido to Tokyo Bay. Officials urged caution, saying that bigger waves could come later.

Damage and evacuations were reported in the Russian regions nearest the quake’s epicenter on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Local authorities on Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula said several people were injured during the massive quake, but didn’t give an exact number.

Oleg Melnikov, head of the regional health department, said a few people hurt themselves while rushing to leave buildings and a hospital patient received an injury while jumping out of a window. Melnikov said that all injured people were in satisfactory condition.

A video released by Russian media outlet showed a team of doctors at a cancer clinic on Kamchatka holding a patient and clutching medical equipment as the quake rocked an operating room, before continuing with surgery after the shaking stopped. Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.

In Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka’s regional capital, the quake damaged a local kindergarten, which was not in operation due to ongoing repair work.

The Russian authorities said that tsunami waves topping 3 meters (10 feet) hit Severokurilsk, the main city on the Pacific archipelago that Russia calls the Kuril Islands.

Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the city’s was flooded by four tsunami waves, which washed fishing boats into the sea, but no major damage was recorded in the city. Power supplies were shut off and the authorities were checking the power network after the flooding.

Japan also asserts territorial rights to the islands it calls the Northern Territories, which were taken by the Soviet Union in the final days of World War II. The dispute has kept the countries from signing a peace treaty.

Wednesday’s 8.8-magnitude quake was among the four strongest earthquakes this century, and among the eight strongest since 1900, according to the USGS.

The earthquake occurred along the Pacific Ring of Fire, the ring of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur.

The 2011 Japan quake and the 2004 earthquake off Indonesia were 9.1 magnitude, and a 2010 earthquake in Chile also was recorded at 8.8 magnitude.

The magnitude 8.8 quake is believed to be thejoint sixth-largest on record. Warnings were issued as far away as Canada’s west coast, while some parts of Japan and Hawaii were given evacuation orders. Minor injuries were reported on Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula, near the quake’s epicenter.

Tsunami warnings have improved greatly in recent decades, since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami which killed 228,000 people, and then the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake which devastated Japan. Most Pacific Rim nations have advanced warning systems and shelter routines, and Japan in particular now has a widespread undersea detection system for seismic activity."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/genetics-not-just-parenting-skills-160521855.html,2025-07-08 16:45:00,"Genetics, not just parenting skills, decide how long your baby cries","How much a baby torments its parents with its cries is determined by its genes and not just parenting techniques, new research has shown.

After a study on hundreds of twins, a team of scientists in Sweden has concluded that how long a baby cries for is largely determined by genetic factors and not only its wellbeing.

The child's sleep quality and ability to be soothed during its first few months are also influenced by genetic predisposition.

""For parents, it may be a comfort to know that their child’s crying is largely explained by genetics, and that they themselves have limited options to influence how much their child cries,"" said study leader Charlotte Viktorsson from Uppsala University in Sweden.

The team's analysis is based on questionnaires completed by the parents of 998 same-sex identical or fraternal twins when the children were two months and five months old.

Among other things, the parents were asked how long the children cried, how often they woke up at night, and how long it took to calm them down. Twins were chosen because they share key factors such as the home environment, family situation and socioeconomic status, which also influence crying behaviour.

Identical twins develop from a single egg cell and therefore have identical genetic material (DNA), while fraternal twins are as genetically different as siblings born in different years. If identical twins are more similar in a particular trait than fraternal twins, we can infer that genetics play a role in the expression of that trait.

On average, more than an hour of crying every day

The survey revealed immense individual differences. For example, some children woke up as many as 10 times a night, while others almost never did.

On average, the twins cried for about 72 minutes daily at the age of two months, woke up more than twice a night and took about 20 minutes to calm down each time. By the age of five months, the average crying duration had decreased to 47 minutes, but the twins still woke up twice a night and took about 14 minutes to calm down.

However, it should be noted that a ""sibling effect"" may come into play: If one twin starts crying, the other often joins in. If both cry, it can take longer for them to calm down.

The clearest evidence for a predominantly genetic basis was found for the duration of crying. At the age of two months, genetics explained about 50% of how much the children cried, according to the study published in the journal JCPP Advances. By the age of five months, this figure had risen to 70%.

The number of night-time awakenings, however, was found to be far less influenced by genetics. Factors such as sleep routines and the environment in which the child sleeps could play a more significant role, the researchers suggested. However, the study does not allow conclusions to be drawn about particularly effective methods for addressing these issues.

When it comes to soothing, the environment appears to have a strong influence only in the first months of life. By the age of five months, the ability to be soothed was primarily determined by genetics, according to the survey data.

The researchers acknowledged limitations, noting that the data is based on parental reports and may not accurately reflect sleep and behaviour. Additionally, the results cannot automatically be applied to single children due to the interaction between twins and the higher demands placed on parents by having two babies. Both factors influence the measured outcomes.

However, an initial sample found no significant differences between twins and single children in terms of crying and soothing behaviour, although there were differences in the number of awakenings. Interestingly, twins woke up less frequently than single children.

The researchers did not explore potential reasons for this unexpected difference. It is possible that a baby feels more secure when its ever-present twin is sleeping nearby, or that it is less easily startled by night-time noises due to its busy environment.

How to soothe a crying baby in 13 minutes

Some time ago, another research team investigated how to calm babies most quickly and developed a minute-by-minute guide.

Parents were told to hold their crying child close to their body and walk at an even pace for about five minutes, avoiding abrupt movements, the researchers explained in the journal Current Biology. Once the baby has fallen asleep, parents should sit with the child for about eight minutes before laying it down to sleep.

The team also provided an explanation for the calming effect of walking: the so-called transport response. This innate effect is observed in many young mammals, such as mice and monkeys that are not yet able to care for themselves. The young animals calm down and their heart rate decreases when they are picked up and carried."

""At 5:55 p.m., Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between 1.5 and 2 inches of rain have fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,"" states the weather service. ""Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.""

Locations impacted by the warning include Southampton, Huntington, Russell, Westhampton, Chester, Blandford, Chesterfield, Worthington, Montgomery and Middlefield.

According to the weather service, ""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.""

Flash flood warning: Take action!

A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it's crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall.

Flood warning: Take action!

A flood warning is declared when flooding is on the verge of happening or is already underway.

Flood advisory: Be aware:

A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.

Flood watch: Be prepared:

A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.

In flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver:

Move to higher ground:

If you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.

Follow evacuation orders:

If local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.

Disconnect utilities and appliances:

If time allows, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This reduces the risk of electrical hazards during flooding.

Avoid basements and submerged areas:

Steer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.

Swift evacuation for your safety:

If you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.

Stay away from floodwaters:

Never attempt to walk through floodwaters. Even just 6 inches of swiftly moving water can forcefully knock you off your feet.

Seek higher ground when trapped:

In the event you become trapped by moving water, make your way to the highest point available and contact emergency services by calling 911.

During heavy rainfall, there is a risk of flooding, especially in low-lying and flood-prone areas. Remember to never drive through water on the road, even if it seems shallow. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most cars. Stay safe by being prepared and informed.

When heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here's your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours:

Beware of rapid water flow:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Slow down and drive with care:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.

Prioritize visibility:

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Heavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/600m-bullish-bets-liquidated-bitcoin-020943263.html,2025-08-02 07:30:00,Yahoo Finance,"Crypto markets experienced a sharp bout of volatility over the past 24 hours, with more than $630 million in leveraged positions liquidated across exchanges.

The bulk of the damage came from longs, which accounted for over $580 million of total liquidations, as traders were caught offside during an abrupt intraday sell-off.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $115,200, erasing some of its recent gains but still maintaining a relatively stable posture compared to other majors. Its dominance rose slightly as altcoins bore the brunt of the correction.

Ether (ETH) fell to $3,687, while XRP (XRP) retraced under $3 despite strong recent headlines. Solana (SOL) pulled back to $170, and BNB (BNB) eased to $780 after a record run last week that punted it above $855.

Coinglass data shows the largest single liquidation was a $13.7 million ETH long on Binance.

Liquidations occur when traders using leverage (borrowed funds) are forcibly closed out of their positions because their collateral falls below required maintenance thresholds. This typically amplifies price volatility, especially in short timeframes, as liquidated positions create sudden selling or buying pressure depending on the side of the trade.

For traders, liquidation data provides insight into market sentiment and risk of positioning. High liquidation totals — particularly concentrated in one direction (e.g., longs) — often signal overextended positioning. This can indicate possible inflection points or impending reversals as the market resets.

Tracking real-time liquidation heatmaps and funding rates can help traders identify areas of forced selling or buying, often around key support/resistance levels, time entries or exits during high-volatility zones and gauge market leverage and risk-on/off behavior

Speculative altcoins were particularly affected. Solana-ecosystem tokens such as Fartcoin (FART), Pump.fun (PUMP) and Jupiter (JUP) all faced steep intraday corrections.

“We observe that tokens like Fartcoin and Pump.fun are less aligned with broader market beta and more reflective of high-volatility, sentiment-driven microcycles,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, said in a Telegram message.

“The recent corrections — FART dropping 14% to retest its 100-day EMA near $1, JUP losing support at its 200-day EMA, and PUMP continuing its slide within a descending channel — appear to stem from profit-taking and waning short-term momentum, not from a systemic market shift.”

Lee added that Bitcoin’s relative strength, supported by ETF inflows and macroeconomic stability, reinforces the view that the pullback is isolated, not broad-based.

Bitcoin holding above $115,000 remains the market’s anchor. Unless that level breaks, the broader structure stays intact."

The Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) reported strong ash emissions from the volcano's summit craters on Monday, prompting authorities to raise the highest alert level for air traffic.

Mount Etna, which rises to more than 3,300 metres, is Europe's largest active volcano. It erupts regularly and is under constant monitoring, with its spectacular displays attracting large numbers of spectators.

Catania's international airport remains open for now, as of Tuesday. However officials are recommending travellers check with airlines to determine whether the volcanic eruption is affecting already booked flights. Travellers can also find updates on theCatania Airport website.

A package holiday booked in the EU can also be cancelled without incurring fees if it is significantly disrupted by extraordinary circumstances. However this requires that the holiday destination is directly affected by the volcanic eruption.

Italy'sNational Institute of Geophysics and Volcanologyoffers detailed updates on the activity of Italian volcanoes (in English and Italian), covering Mount Etna and the Stromboli volcano on the island of the same name.

Experts generally advise regularly checking online resources like these before travelling to a volcanic region. Your country's foreign ministry will likely also offer advisories and travel warnings for your destination.

In many countries, national authorities provide warnings and information about natural hazards on their websites, often in English. Additionally, holidaymakers can ask for specific advice at hotel receptions or from their hosts.

Mount Etna had already erupted in June, with a huge column of smoke causing days of cancellations before the local airport could reopen.

There are over 1,500 active volcanoes worldwide, some of which are located in holiday regions. As such, volcanic eruptions are not uncommon, and for some intrepid travellers they are even reason to fly to a destination, not avoid it."

(KTAL/KMSS) – Most people would say that raising kids when they are 12-14 years old is one of the toughest periods of parenting, but what if it didn’t have to be?

Dr. Sheryl Gonzalez Ziegler, Psy.D., an acclaimed expert in children’s mental health, explores how to lay the foundation for your child’s teenage years in her book, “The Crucial Years: The Essential Guide to Mental Health and Modern Puberty in Middle Childhood.”

Astrology and self-discovery: A guide to understanding your birth chart

The “crucial years,” which Dr. Ziegler refers to as the “forgotten years,” are ages 6-12 and sometimes go overlooked in terms of child development. What some parents don’t realize is that children at this age are still heavily influenced by their parents, despite no longer being toddlers.

“It’s the perfect time to actually instill the things that matter to you, where your kid will soak it up,” Dr. Ziegler said. “Then, as they enter those teen years, they’ll be prepared for the things you’ve been warning them about or teaching them because they got the information when their brain was ripe for listening to you.”

One of the biggest topics in Dr. Ziegler’s book is teaching children to regulate their emotions, which means the ability to handle and calm themselves amid an event. Self-regulation can provide several short- and long-term mental health benefits, and can be achieved by learning what your children’s “window of tolerance” is.

“We all have a window of tolerance, what we can tolerate,” Dr. Ziegler said. “Think about it when you’re traveling. The flight got delayed once, a little frustrating. The flight is now cancelled…For a lot of people, that’s outside of their window. Now they’re angry, they’re cursing, they’re calling people, they’re in someone’s face. They’re outside of the window of tolerance. That’s what life is like for a lot of kids.”

Dr. Ziegler uses several visual metaphors in her book, including the “volcano” and the “iceberg,” to help children visualize their feelings.

“The anger volcano…we have lava that bubbles underneath the surface and then eventually…it erupts,” Dr. Ziegler said. “When we have the eruption, it’s not just at the person that you’re mad at. It goes everywhere.

“The iceberg is all the stuff we can’t see under the surface. This is perfect for the kid who comes in, does their work, and seems happy…What was under the surface was, ‘I felt like a loser. I felt like nobody liked me. I felt like I was dumb.’ It’s truly like the tip of an iceberg, and then all the water underneath to let them know nobody can see what’s under there.”

Dr. Ziegler also cautions parents not to blame kids specifically for when they misbehave, but rather the factors that led them to lash out or cause trouble.

“We use those words like ‘always’ and ‘never,'” Dr. Ziegler said. “They’re powerful words that can instill in a kid, ‘See? I’m a bad kid. My parents say I always ruin dinner. I always do this. I never help.’ Remember, 6-12, they’re like sponges and they’re taking it in.”

When it comes to putting pressure on children, studies have found that students whose parents value achievement more than kindness do worse academically and socially.

“When kids get the message of ‘You need to be a straight-A student,’ what they hear is, ‘I only have value, you only love me if I get straight-A’s,” Ziegler said. “Versus if you say to them, ‘Kindness is above everything. Everything else will fall into place in life, but what’s most important is that you care about your neighbors, that you care about your friends, that you’re an upstander.’

“When we are happy human beings, we tend to do well in other areas of our lives. When we are pressured human beings, we tend to crumble. We tend to make mistakes because we feel nervous and anxious.”

One chapter that Dr. Ziegler wanted to highlight was “Preteens and Success,” which talks about screen time and its effects on children.

“I do think that today’s child honestly can’t be fully successful until they manage a healthier digital life,” Dr. Ziegler said. “It’s not an anti-screens chapter. It gives you the data that I think is important and specifically focused on 6-12 year olds, which is unique. There are some truly detrimental outcomes from them. However, they are part of our lives. So, here are some things you can do to set up boundaries, restrictions, and monitoring conversations.”

You can read that chapter and more in Dr. Ziegler’s new book, “The Crucial Years,” available onAmazon,Barnes & Noble, and other retailers.

Credit - VCG/Getty Images

As the U.S. under President Donald Trump increasingly closes itself off from the world, denying entry to tourists amid a crackdown on border controls and migration, its geopolitical rival China, which has long been known for its relative isolation, has loosened its travel restrictions to unprecedented levels.

By July 16, China will have expanded visa-free entry to 75 countries as part of a broader campaign to boost inbound tourism, which has already seen a surge. Last year, over 20 million foreigners visited China without a visa, doubling that of the previous year, according to China’s National Immigration Administration. Shanghai alonereceived 2.6 million overseas visitsin the first half of this year, around half of which were visa-free entries, a 45% year-on-year increase. China has been steadily pushing for more people to visit since reopening its borders in early 2023, after its“Zero-COVID” policiesappeared for a time as though they mightdrive the countryinto alasting isolation.

It’s also part of China’s effort to boost its soft power, especially at a time when the Trump Administration appears to be withdrawing the U.S. from the global stage. In recent months, Trump hasmovedto restrictinternational studentsfrom the U.S.,impose sweeping tariffson the rest of the world, andshutter USAID, whilereportsof tourists beingdetainedordenied entryby Immigration and Customs Enforcement havedeterredsome from visiting the U.S.

China’s response to U.S. actions—including thetargeting of Chinese international studentsandU.S. interventionin theIsrael-Iran War—has been relatively restrained, signalling the country’s desire to maintain cordial diplomatic ties to the U.S., especially amidtrade negotiations, while also advocating for multilateralism like never before.

The U.S. has “demonstrated its military capabilities, its commitment to allies, and its influence in crisis management” through Trump’seffortstobrokerpeace dealsaround the world, at times wielding the threat of force, but “these are not the metrics by which China measures its global role,” says Lin Jing, a research fellow at the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore. “Instead, China continues to showcase its consistency and stability, its non-aligned posture, and its support for a U.N.-centered international order.”.

“There’s recognition that when you don’t have people-to-people exchanges, you lose an important bulwark against populist rhetoric on both sides,” David Weeks, co-founder and chief operating officer of Sunrise International, a consulting firm that advises overseas universities on recruiting Chinese students,previously told TIME. “China thinks that we need more, not less, exchange if we have disagreements.”

In May, Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng emphasized the importance of people-to-people exchanges to U.S.-China relations, just as the U.S. announced enhanced screenings of student visa applicants from China and Hong Kong. “It is people-to-people ties that invigorate China-U.S. relations,” hesaidat his embassy. “We warmly welcome all American friends to travel in China, shop in China, succeed in China and take part in Chinese modernisation. Come and see the country with your own eyes.”

Inbound tourism could also help to rejuvenate China’s domestic economy, which the Chinese government hasprioritizedto mitigate against the worst effects of Trump’s tariffs as well as highyouth unemploymentand apersistent real estate crisis. China isopeningmore duty-free shops around the country in an effort to bolster spending within the country. Meanwhile, Chinese businesses, like‘Labubu’ toy retailer Pop Mart, havegained global popularity, boosting China’ssoft powerand interest around the world in visiting the country.

Here’s what to know.

Much of Europe, Asia, and parts of the Middle East are able to travel to China without a visa.

China began expanding its visa-free scheme after reopening its borders in 2023 after inbound travel plummeted during the pandemic. The countrysawjust 14 million visitors in 2023 as compared to 32 million in 2019.

Since then, Beijing hasintroduced or resumed visa-free entryfor visitors from nearly every European country, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and most Asian countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea. Citizens of five Latin American countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay—and Uzbekistan wereaddedto the scheme in June. Four countries in the Middle East—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia—were alsograntedvisa-free entry last month. Azerbaijan willbecomeeligible on July 16, bringing the total to 75. (By comparison, nationals from 42 countries have visa-free access to the U.S. for tourism or business stays up to 90 days under theVisa Waiver Program.)

China’s scheme allows citizens of eligible countries to enter without a visa for up to 30 days.

“Our inbound tourism has already recovered to 70 to 80 per cent of pre-Covid levels. It could be fully recovered this year,” James Liang, chairman of China’s leading online travel service Ctrip,reportedly toldShanghai-based outlet The Paper. “There are still some bottlenecks to be addressed. If they are tackled, China’s inbound tourism could reach the world’s top tier in 10 or 20 years.”

China has alsoexpanded its transit policythat allows travellers from 55 countries to enter China without a visa for 10 days if they then depart for a different country from where they came. The transit policy includes 10 countries that are not part of the visa-free scheme: Canada, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, the U.K., Ukraine, and the U.S.

China is also aiming toopen up Xinjiang—the Uyghur autonomous region that is under Western sanctions overhuman-rights concerns—to more domestic and foreign tourists. Earlier this year, local officials announced goals of bringing in at least 400 million annual visits to the region by 2030.

China’s opening up is happening against a backdrop of the U.S. tightening its visa rules.

Trump has targeted international students in hiscrackdownon universities across the U.S. His punitive moves have included attempting toremove Harvard’s abilityto enroll international students,targeting foreign-born studentsfor removal from the country, and quietly revoking the visas of thousands of international students (beforereversingthe move). He’s also heightened screening requirements for student visa applicants—especially those from China—including requiring applicantsmake their social media accounts “public” for vetting.

During his 2024 campaign, Trump alsovowed to reinstate his travel banon travellers from Muslim countries, and in June heannounced a new travel banon nationals from 12 countries and tightened restrictions on nationals from seven more. And he isreportedlyconsidering adding 36 countries to the travel ban list.

Several countries have issued advisories about travelling to the U.S., including China, whichadvisedits citizens to “fully assess the risks” before travelling to the U.S. because of “the deterioration in China-U.S. trade relations and the domestic security situation in the U.S.”

Some European countries, including the U.K. and Germany,issued warningsafter multiple European travellers were detained at the U.S. border, some for weeks. Others, including Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands,cautionedtransgender and nonbinary travellers about U.S. travel after Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, and several states have targeted trans people. Canada, too,warnedits citizens about potential delays, denial of entry, and device seizures. Some Canadians have alsolaunched a travel boycottof the U.S., after Trump repeatedly threatened to use “economic force” tomake Canada the 51st stateof the U.S.

Overseas travel to the U.S. has dropped 2.5% through April this year as compared to a year ago, Bloombergreported, with the largest drop of 10% happening in March after Trump announced tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. The World Travel & Tourism Councilestimatesthat the U.S. will lose out on $12.5 billion from tourism this year, although some suggest theshortfall could be as high as $29 billion.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/investigating-claims-trump-admins-ice-013000018.html,2025-07-11 03:00:00,Investigating claims Trump admin's ICE funding surpasses Russia's military budget,"In the summer of 2025, a rumor spread online that lawmakers provided U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a larger budget than Russia gives its military. Although the numbers cited in these claims differed, most claimed ICE received roughly $170 or $175 billion.

However, total funding actually allocated to ICE was roughly $75 billion through September 2029 under U.S. President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) alongside a proposed — but not yet approved — base budget for the agency of $11.29 billion for fiscal year 2026. The $170 or $175 billion number appeared to come from estimates foroverallimmigration enforcement spending under the OBBB, not just funding specifically allocated to ICE.

These posts also alleged Russia's military budget was anywhere from $126 billion to $149 billion. Reputable think tanks estimated Russia's military funding at about $149 billion U.S. dollars in 2024 and $160 billion in planned spending for 2025.

Thus, potential ICE spending under the Trump administration for fiscal year 2026 did not surpass an estimate for Russia's planned military spending in 2025. However, it's possible the United States' overall immigration enforcement spending from Oct. 1, 2025, to Sept. 30, 2026, could exceed Russia's planned military budget in 2025. A direct comparison was not possible because the two countries use different budgeting timelines.

In the summer of 2025, a claim spread online that American lawmakers granted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) a bigger budget than Russia provided its military.

The rumor spread on platforms likeXandFacebook; while many claims included dollar amounts for both Russia's military and ICE, those numbers differed. For example, some posts alleged ICE received$175 billionin funding; others claimed the agency received$170 billionto spend. In comparison, claims listed Russia's military budget as anywhere from$126 billionto$149 billion.

These claims appeared to use legitimate — but outdated — sources to determine Russia's military budget while also conflating ICE's funding withestimatesfor overall immigration enforcement spending under U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and budget megabill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which hesigned into lawon July 4, 2025.

A direct, entirely accurate monetary comparison of the two budgets was not possible, given differences in how the United States and Russia provide budget information — as well as theunstableexchange rate between Russia's currency, the ruble, and the American dollar, at least as of this writing.

However, potential ICE spending by Trump's administration for fiscal year 2026, which runs from Oct. 1, 2025 to Sept. 30, 2026, did not surpass reputable estimates for Russia's planned military spending in 2025. Still, it's possible that the United States' overall immigration enforcement spending in fiscal year 2026 could exceed Russia's potential military budget in 2025.

Snopes previouslydeterminedthe actual amount allocated to ICE under the Big Beautiful Bill andprovided contextfor a rumor that funds allocated to ICE exceeded spending for the U.S. Marine Corps.

Two major budget allocations were slated to be available to ICE for fiscal year 2026. The first was the base budget amount, known as the ""appropriations"" process. Although the presidentrequestedthese funds in May, as of this writing, the U.S. Congress had not yet approved his budget proposal. The Big Beautiful Bill, a budget ""reconciliation"" bill, was considered a supplement to the base budget.

The total proposedbase budgetfor ICE in fiscal year 2026 was $11.29 billion, according to the agency'sbudget requestdocument — an increase from $10.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 (seePage 5). According to the agency, the bulk of that amount, $10.88 billion, would need Congressional approval; the rest would come from fees, such as those imposed on travelers.

In addition to this base budget, ICE will receive another approximately $75 billion to remain available until Sept. 30, 2029, through theBig Beautiful Bill, as wepreviously reported.

There were two major provisions in the GOP bill allocating funds to ICE: the first provision, onPage 825, Section 90003, ""Detention Capacity,"" sent $45 billion to ICE specifically for immigration detention centers (emphasis ours):

SEC. 90003. DETENTION CAPACITY.

In addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated, there isappropriated to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, toremain available until September 30, 2029,$45,000,000,000, for single adult alien detention capacity and family residential center capacity.

The second provision, starting onPage 904, appropriated $29.85 billion to ICE for the purposes of hiring, training, recruiting and retaining officers, facility upgrades, ""promoting family unity"" by keeping detained immigrants with their children, attorneys and legal staff, funding an office supporting victims of immigration crimes and ""fleet modernization"" — presumably a reference to updating ICE aircraft and vehicles.

SEC. 100052. APPROPRIATION FOR U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Homeland Securityfor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated,$29,850,000,000, to remain available through September 30, 2029.

Add the two provisions together to arrive at $74.85 billion on top of the annual base budget proposed at $11.29 billion for fiscal year 2026. The Big Beautiful Bill also imposed additional fees on people facing various immigration enforcement actions, a portion of which would go to ICE's coffers (see pages 896 and 898 ofthe bill).

According to an April 2025publicationby theStockholm International Peace Research Institute, a highlyrespectedthink tank that collects global data on annual military spending, the ""planned total military expenditure in 2025"" for Russia was about 5.5 trillion rubles, equivalent to about $160 billion U.S. dollars — ""although the volatility of the exchange rate makes this estimate highly speculative,"" the institute warned onPage 8.

The actual amount spent, according to the institute'smilitary spending tracker, was about $149 billion U.S. dollars, assome claimsstated.

Aside from the constantly changing exchange rate for the ruble, it is also difficult to provide a direct comparison of Russia's spending with the ICE budget because in Russia budget yearsmatchwith calendar years, whereas in the United States budgets typically follow fiscal years. Fiscal year 2026, for example, runs from Oct. 1, 2025 to Sept. 30, 2026.

Furthermore, ICE'sbudget documentsdid not include how much the agency planned to budget from the Big Beautiful Bill's allocations for fiscal year 2026. As such, it was not possible to determine ICE's exact total annual budget, as the Big Beautiful Bill stipulated a single large infusion of money — the $75 billion — to remain available to the agency for multiple years, through Sept. 30, 2029.

Snopes asked ICE whether the agency can provide estimates for how much it planned to spend from Big Beautiful Bill allocations in fiscal year 2026 and awaits a response.

Still, adding the $74.85 billion (available over four years) to the proposed $11.29 billion (over one budget year) makes a total of $86.14 billion that could be allocated to ICE, far less than the $160 billion estimate for Russia's planned military spending in 2025.

Advocacygroupsandreputablenewsoutletshave made estimates ranging from$150 billionto $170 billionfortotal overall immigration enforcementspending under the Big Beautiful Bill. Alongside the $75 billion for ICE, the $150 billion-to-$175 billion amount would include, for example, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement provisions, such as $46.55 billion allocated for the border wall and $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol personnel (seePage 824).

U.S. Rep. Mark Harris, a Republican from North Carolina, also claimed in a July 3news releasethat the bill allocated $175 billion in ""new funding"" to ""finish securing the border."" Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina,reportedlytold journalists back in February that the Trump administration initially asked for $175 billion in immigration enforcement funding.

Snopes has not independently verified any of these estimates.

It is worth noting, however, that these $150 billion-to-$175 billion estimates were focused on the Big Beautiful Bill alone. In other words, they do not appear to encompasstotalamounts of spending on immigration enforcement. For instance, aside from the amount in the Big Beautiful Bill, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requested $23 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol's base budget (seePage 4).

U.S. lawmakers allocated $75 billion to ICE under the Big Beautiful Bill through Sept. 30, 2029, and Trump proposed an $11.29 billion base budget on top of that for fiscal year 2026, which Congress had not yet approved as of this writing. In contrast, a reputable think tank estimated Russia's planned military spending for 2025 at approximately $160 billion U.S. dollars, a figure subject to change due to the fluctuating exchange rate between Russian rubles and American dollars. Estimates foroverallimmigration spending, not just ICE's funding, ranged from $150 billion to $170 billion.

While direct comparisons are not possible because the two countries present financial information differently, ICE's potential budget for fiscal year 2026 does not exceed Russia's military budget for 2025. However, overall immigration enforcement spending in the United States for fiscal year 2026 could exceed the amount Russia's military might receive in 2025.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/mass-dismissals-education-department-civil-140000378.html,2025-07-08 14:30:00,Education Department dismisses thousands of civil rights complaints at an ‘unheard of’ pace,"The Education Department dismissed civil rights complaints at such a rapid clip this year that former officials and advocates are concerned about a core agency function amid Trump administration plans to make deep staffing cuts.

In court documents filed last week, the department disclosed that its Office for Civil Rights dismissed 3,424 complaints between March 11 and June 27 “consistent with OCR’s Case Processing Manual.” The documents state that 96 complaints were ""resolved"" because of insufficient evidence during an investigation — and another 290 complaints with voluntary agreements, settlements or technical assistance.

During that time period, OCR received 4,833 complaints, opened 309 for investigation and opened 26 directed investigations, according to a court declaration filed as part of acase that challenged the agency’s decisionto conduct a sweeping reduction in force. Unlike most investigations, directed or self-initiated investigations are launched by the agency without someone filing a formal complaint about a school, college or university.

“The nation’s students and schools deserve a robust federal civil rights enforcement office that is fully equipped and prepared to enforce the full range of rights Congress guaranteed in law,” Catherine Lhamon, the department’s civil rights chief under former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, said in a statement to POLITICO. “The Trump Administration’s own data reporting shows it has decimated its ability to fulfill its statutory duties, to the detriment of rights in school.”

The department has focused its civil rights efforts on stamping out campus antisemitism, ending protections for transgender student athletes and eliminating all traces of diversity, equity and inclusion in education since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Colleges and universities that have not adhered to Trump's directives have had millions of dollars in federal aid frozen, become the focus of federal investigations and faced a torrent of public criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans.

Civil rights advocates say they are concerned about the high number of dismissals because the Trump administration interprets federal civil rights laws that address sex-based discrimination and discrimination based on race, national origin and shared ancestry differently from the Biden administration.

Under Education Secretary Linda McMahon, discrimination in these categories no longer includes gender identity andLGBTQ+ challenges against book bans. They now include the Trump administration’srule on how schools must respond to sexual misconductand higher levels of scrutiny of antisemitism on campus andrace-inclusive programminglike affinity graduations.

The Education Department declined to answer a series of detailed questions about its civil rights work but said all of OCR’s actions align with federal law.

“OCR has taken unprecedented steps to streamline its functions according to demand: for example, amid a growing volume of Title IX complaints, OCR partnered with the Department of Justice to expeditiously investigate sex-based discrimination claims,” agency spokesperson Julie Hartman said in a statement. “OCR’s daily accomplishments under the Trump Administration disprove the rampant fear-mongering by irresponsible media, and evince that OCR is vigorously upholding its responsibilities to protect all Americans’ civil rights.""

Advocates fear this new policy agenda is taking a toll on the routine work of an office that is responsible for investigating a range of problems including campus sexual misconduct and claims of discrimination in special education.

McMahon has also pledged to enact Trump's policies even with a slimmed down staff. Seven of the department’s 12 regional civil rights offices across the country were eliminated during themassive reduction in force in March. Those offices are in Boston, Dallas, New York, Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco and Philadelphia. A federal judge in Massachusetts, however,ordered those workers be called back,saying the mass layoffs “leaves OCR with the capacity to address only a small fraction of the complaints that it receives.”

By contrast, during the last three months of the Biden administration, OCR dismissed 2,527 cases, resolved 449 with resolution agreements for change, secured 146 successful mediations, and determined there was no violation in 119 cases.

The difference between the number of mediated or voluntary resolution cases recorded in the last three months of the Biden administration, when compared to the number of resolutions disclosed by the Trump administration within three months earlier this year, “reflects a shocking diminution of work output from the office,” Lhamon said.

One former agency official, granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, was stunned by the new data.

“That amount of dismissals in a three-month period is unheard of,” the former official, who worked in OCR and was at the department for about 20 years, said. “If they dismiss that amount of cases in a matter of three months, then they're not following the procedures. What it sounds like they're doing to me is they're just dismissing cases that they don't want to take the time to investigate, or put the resources into.”

There are few instances where the office will dismiss a complaint, they said. If the complaint doesn’t have enough information and OCR can’t get in touch with the person who filed it, that would be grounds for dismissal. They would also dismiss a case if someone were to complain about a school that doesn’t receive federal funding and therefore doesn’t fall within OCR’s jurisdiction.

“But those types of complaints are very rare,” the former official said. “Maybe one in a thousand.”

Similarconcerns about the number of dismissalsemerged during the first Trump administration as the agency sought to reduce a massive backlog of cases in 2017. OCR at the time closed more than 1,500 civil rights complaints and dismissed more than 900 outright in roughly two months after issuing a directive to agency investigators.

“We should be concerned about that amount, especially given the way that this administration has prioritized weaponizing civil rights laws and distorting these laws,” said Shiwali Patel, senior director of safe and inclusive schools at the National Women’s Law Center.

She said the number of dismissals signals that students and parents “can't rely on this administration to protect them from discrimination.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/portion-dayton-road-temporarily-closed-194051634.html,2025-07-18 23:15:00,Portion of Dayton road temporarily closed after sinkhole forms,"DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) — The formation of a sinkhole is causing a portion of a Dayton road to close.

One southbound lane of Riverside Drive is closed after a 6 foot by 6 foot sinkhole formed at the intersection of Riverside Drive and Ryburn Avenue.

Both southbound lanes of Riverside Drive at Siebenthaler Avenue will close roughly after 9 a.m. on July 28. Southbound lanes of Riverside Drive will be closed at Ryburn and Siebenthaler avenues until just before 7 a.m. on July 30.

Police looking for suspect accused of entering window, stealing cigarettes

According to the city, the closure is needed to ensure inspection and repair can be conducted.

“To ensure there are no hidden voids beneath the surface, crews will need to remove additional pavement around the affected area,” said the city.

Dayton suggests southbound drivers on Riverside Drive take East Siebenthaler Avenue to North Main Street to East Hillcrest Avenue to Riverside Drive.

Work began today to repair a sinkhole on Midlothian Boulevard — that opened up yesterday — causing the eastbound lanes right around I-680 to be closed.   The hole was caused by the collapse of a sanitary sewer line.  It created a hole 11 feet deep.

According to the city’s Department of Public Works, the eastbound lanes are closed between Shirley Road and Lemoyne Drive — in front of Steel City Bar and Grill — due to the collapse of a 30-inch sanitary sewer and manhole.

Repairs began Friday. A city official said that barring something unforeseen, the work should be done and the road reopened in a week or so.

The posted detour will be Interstate 680 South to U.S. Route 224 to I-680 North to Midlothian Boulevard.

(WKRN) — Nashville Public Radio told News 2 there will be an immediate impact if Congress passes President Donald Trump’s rescission package.

The proposal aims to eliminateover $1 billion from NPR and PBS. Trump gave Republicans an ultimatum if they don’t vote in favor of his funding cuts.

“We use Studio B for all of our live broadcasts and also for news presentations,” Kenda Lovecchio, vice president of development at Nashville Public Radio, said.

Nashville Public Radio has been a part of Middle Tennessee for more than 60 years.

“We’re 90.3 WPLN News and 91.1, your music discovery station,” Lovecchio said.

House approves Trump’s request to cut funding for NPR, PBS and foreign aid

After spending decades relying on listeners, those at Nashville Public Radio now fear they’re being silenced.

“I absolutely feel that there’s been a threat to public broadcasting, and also to the industry,” Lovecchio said.

NPR and PBS are both threatened as Trump pushes to take back over $1 billion of federal funding from the public broadcasters.

“I think it’s very unfair, it’s been very biased…it’s a waste of money,” the president has said in the past.

On Thursday, July 10, Trump wrote, in part, on Truth Social, “Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.”

U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) appears to be in support. She posted on X Thursday afternoon that the rescission package would cut $9.4 billion in “wasteful spending” in order to “save taxpayer dollars and streamline the federal government’s work.”

Senate GOP gears up for test on Trump’s DOGE cuts

Meanwhile, Nashville Public Radio would lose $400,000 a year, which is 5% of its annual budget.

“The commitment that we receive through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been guaranteed. It’s been something that’s provided to us on an annual basis, and so it is a critical time because we are in need of finding a way to cover that lack,” Lovecchio said.

According to Lovecchio, the majority of funding comes from individuals in the community and corporate sponsorships. She added that support is needed now more than ever.

“This is a threat that further challenges our position, our field, our industry, and we feel that it’s just critical to local journalism to maintain the support from our community in order for us to continue and to thrive,” Lovecchio said.

Darcy Deefholts, 19, was found in North Solitary Island off Wooli after being swept away while surfing. He had left his home on Wednesday afternoon to head toward Wooli beach, according to police.

After his son's disappearance, Terry Deefholts pleaded with community on social media to help locate Darcy, saying he was ""fearing the worst.""

“I am asking anyone with a seaworthy vessel to please meet me at the main Wooli boat ramp and take me to sea to help with the search,"" he wrote before describing the discovery as a""one-in-a-million miracle.""

While Darcy's bike, clothes and shoes were found at a local spot known as One Tree, his phone and smartwatch were left at home.

With over 1100 shares on his Facebook post, Terry posted, “We are overwhelmed by the community efforts in the search so far. There is only one thing we want now – our beloved boy to be found safe currently.""

Darcy is now receiving medical treatment, while his family is still processing the trauma.

“I haven’t had the chance to talk to him yet, I’m just so over the moon,"" said Terry. ""I’m still just processing everything. We’ve had no sleep and it has been a lot to deal with.""

""It's rare that we ever get to participate in a search with an outcome such as this,"" said rescuer Matthew McLennan, according to theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It was really heartwarming to see how many community members jumped to the call.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-vs-bitcoin-better-buy-102700441.html,2025-07-09 11:15:00,Yahoo Finance,"Bitcoin is at a unique moment in its history, with widespread institutional adoption.

XRP is building the scaffolding it needs to be favored by institutions as well.

One of these assets is better for longer-term holding than the other is likely to be.

10 stocks we like better than XRP ›

Most investing decisions feel like choosing between two distant futures. In crypto right now, one such fork in the road is whether to buy an asset built on engineered scarcity, or one engineered for regulated utility and widespread use.

The question matters because capital is finally pouring into both lanes at once.Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)is drawing record institutional inflows whileXRP(CRYPTO: XRP)is winning a few serious gigs to provide financial plumbing. The trade‑off between slow‑burn ""digital gold"" and faster‑moving payment rails has never been starker, so let's sort out which path fits which kind of investor.

Bitcoin currently trades around $109,000 as of July 7 despite a considerable amount of recent macroeconomic volatility.

The latest leg higher came from purchasing driven by institutions and holders of large sums of capital, not small-time investors seeking a thrill.BlackRock's Bitcoinexchange-traded fund (ETF), theiShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, took in more than $1.3 billion in fresh cash in the last week of June, part of a haul of more than $4 billion that all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs absorbed in the month.

Collectively, at least 116 public companies now hold a total of roughly 809,100 Bitcoins on their balance sheets, more than double the corporate stash a year ago.

Why does that matter? It's evidence that the ""demand"" portion of the supply and demand dynamics affecting the coin is very healthy. When paired with the favorable and ongoing action of thehalving process, one of the main factors affecting the coin's supply, it suggests that it's appropriate to be bullish about the coin.

In short, Bitcoin's issuance halves roughly every four years, crimping new supply just as ETF sponsors, corporates, and long‑term allocators compete for the float. Scarcity was always part of the asset's pitch, and now it is colliding with regulated distribution channels that make large buys painless for big buyers.

In theory, that should push the asset's price discovery into a narrower, mostly upward corridor, and for the long term. This catalyst is playing out right now.

The investment thesis for buying XRP is quite different.

It's priced near $2.28 today, and its ledger, XRPL, just activated an automated market maker (AMM) feature, letting any wallet convert assets on‑chain and earn fees from idle balances. That's a key feature for the chain's intended users, institutional investors.

Another important capability for courting that same audience is that XRPL bakes in regulator‑friendly tools, like authorized trust lines, blacklists, and the ability to freeze accounts so issuers can remain in good standing with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.

That matters because tokenizing real‑world assets (RWA) so that they can be handled more easily by asset managers is becoming big business, and compliance tooling is essential to capturing that business. The RWA sector's value hit $24.8 billion in June, and it could balloon to $30 trillion by 2034, per some estimates. XRP is already attracting key projects on its chain, including a $693 million Treasury bond fund, giving users 24/7 access to short‑term government debt. As more assets are tokenized, having must-have assets like Treasuries on-chain will make the ledger an even more appealing place for institutional investors to park their capital.

In other words, with XRP the value-generating flywheel is liquidity at the scale that institutional investors need it. Each tokenized Treasury or corporate debt issue deepens its on‑ledger pools, reduces pricing inaccuracy for big transactions, and nudges newcomers to hold a small XRP reserve to transact.

Assuming regulators stay comfortable with XRPL's top‑down compliance controls, that adoption curve could steepen over the next three to five years.

Think of Bitcoin as a zero‑yield digital commodity whose upside comes from enforced scarcity meeting mainstream acceptance. Its payoff profile looks like a long-dated bond, with slow, steady, but potentially massive returns accruing across halving cycles for those who are patient.

XRP is more like a fast‑growing fintech stock. Success hinges on product‑market fit and execution. Yet it's because of this elevated risk that the coin's ramp‑up, if it happens, could dwarf Bitcoin's percentage gains, and those gains could occur sooner.

A balanced crypto portfolio might allocate 80% to Bitcoin for stability and 5% or so to XRP for higher risk exposure. The pair can coexist in the same account without any contradiction. Just be honest about your time horizon and risk tolerance before you choose your lane.

And if you're only interested in choosing one, you should choose Bitcoin today. XRP is a great coin, but it is simply not the safer option at these lofty prices.

Residents are speaking out against reckless driving and advocates are calling for an end to drunk driving.

Advocates call for action against drunk driving 5 years after tragic crash

Eric Checchio has lived along Wilikina Drive for about one year and said he has gotten used to cars racing down the road right outside his apartment building.

“Especially in the middle of the night, you’re in bed, you got little kids that got to get up for school, we’ll be in the living room watching T.V. and a car will go zipping by, or a motorcycle or something like that. Even the motorcycles do it,” Checchio said as a motorcycle revved its engine. “Prime example!”

Residents said several cars have been totaled while parked along Wilikina Drive and they will not be the last unless a solution is found. Two wrecks in the last six months have left residents on edge about reckless drivers smashing into their vehicle.

“Why should we have to worry about being parked in a stall that we pay for and have to worry about coming out the next morning to our car cleaned out?” Checchio said.

“I’ve heard probably like up to like, 20 accidents,” said Wahiawa resident Rory Redmon. “Man, like, it’s got to stop. How do you prevent this type of thing from happening? You know what I mean, in the future.”

“A lot of people follow the speed limit, yeah? And a lot don’t,” said Rory Redmon, a Wahiawa resident.

Residents add speed humps, a traffic light or even a police car with its blue light on might help the situation.

“I love HPD, I’m not trying to get down on HPD, but you know, either having HPD out here every once in a while, maybe more roving patrols,” Checchio said.

Advocates are hoping everyone makes it through the next couple of nights without a serious or fatal crash at the hands of a drunk driver over the Forth of July weekend. They point to the Department of Transportation message boards which are displaying the name of 15-year-oldBrian Paulette— Paulette was just 15 years old when he was killed by a drunk driver in 1992.

“It’s, you know, a powerful reminder that these aren’t just faceless tragedies. You know, it’s putting a name to something that occurred and hopefully it’s more impactful for people driving,” said Makena Young, Mothers Against Drunk Driving Hawaii program manager.

“It needs to be slowed down, something needs to be done because there’s people dying,” Checchio said. “I really hate to say this, but no one does anything until something bad happens.”

“He’s been my protector since birth,” said his younger cousin Kala Lau. “I don’t know what I would do without him, but I know he’s going to get through because he’s our drill sergeant and he’s so strong, and he’s the healthiest person I know.

As vaccination ratesamong childrencontinue to plummet, concerns are rising over the potential for infectious disease to spread rampantly in the coming years and decades. Research published inJAMAsuggests a continued decline could lead to millions of infections from diseases currently considered under control or eradicated.

Moderna gets full FDA approval for kids COVID-19 vaccine

The impact of declining vaccination rates is already becoming visible. As of the middle of 2025, the U.S. is having the worst year for measles inover three decades. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported1,288confirmed cases in 38 states as of July 8.

Democratic Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumersenta letterto Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.asking him to declare a health emergency over the recent measles outbreaks.

RFK Jr. adviser denies being anti-vaccine, cites career developing vaccines

Schumer blamed the administration for the worst measles outbreak in 33 years, citing cuts to disease experts, halted grants and politicized vaccine policy.

“To prevent this historic record high spread from reaching further and to save lives, you shouldimmediately declare a Public Health Emergency for measles,” said Schumer.

If vaccination rates continue at the same pace, researchers predict851,300 casesof measles over the next 25 years. Additionally, if rates were to fall by even 10% cases would shoot up to 11.1 million over the next 25 years.

Rubella, or “German measles,” is another previously eradicated disease in the U.S. that could see heightened levels of infection if vaccination rates remain the same.

New CDC vaccine panel bans thimerosal-based flu shots

According to theWorld Health Organization, before the introduction of the vaccine, up to 4 babies in every 1,000 births were born with rubella. The condition remains the leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects worldwide.

Pregnant women are unable to get the vaccine because it contains thelive virus. So, as community immunity weakens, the risk of rubella resurging grows, placing unborn children and expectant mothers in preventable danger.

Polio, a disease that onceparalyzed and killedthousands of children across the U.S., could also reemerge if vaccination rates continue to fall.

50% of Americans disapprove of RFK Jr.’s vaccine panel decisions

Though declared eliminated in the country in 1979, the virus still exists in parts of the world and can be reintroduced through international travel. With polio vaccination rates declining in30 states, the risk of outbreaks grows, potentially leading to thousands of cases in the coming decades.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rfk-jr-policies-making-covid-100000873.html,2025-07-23 11:30:00,RFK Jr.’s Policies Are Inflaming the Threat of Covid,"Leigh Haldeman, a nurse at a hospital in Seattle who is 32 weeks pregnant with her second child, was advised in early June by her medical team to get vaccinated for Covid. This was not idle medical advice: She’d had complications in her first pregnancy that made her high risk if she were to get Covid. Her midwife advised her to get the vaccine while she was still pregnant, to avoid getting Covid in her third trimester and toprotect her newborn.

What should have been a straightforward vaccination turned into a Kafkaesque runaround—one that portends the chaos to come for people trying to get Covid vaccines now and come the fall. The result will be lower rates of Covid vaccination and higher rates of transmission, long Covid, hospitalizations, and deaths with asummer surgealready underway.

In late May, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hadtaken to Xto announce that Covid vaccinationswould no longer be recommendedto pregnant people or healthy children, althoughlong Covid is now the most common chronic condition among children.* A week before, the Food and Drug Administration had alsoannouncedthat healthy people under age 65 would not be eligible for the shot.

The announcement raised a flurry of questions and panic within the public health community: Notwithstanding the fact that this abrupt announcement occurred on social media rather than any official channel, it preempted the late June meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, a team of experts who have handled annual vaccination recommendations for the past half-century. It also, of course, went against thehundredsof studies on the Covid vaccine’ssafety and efficacy.Recent data on last winter’s Covid shotshowed 30–40 percent additional protection against urgent care visits and 40–70 percent additional protection against hospitalizations and ICU stays, with protection lasting six months or more.

The directive was also contradictory, marking an unprecedented divergence in the guidance from public health experts at the CDC and competing information coming down from RFK Jr. and the FDA. TheCDC clearly lists pregnancyas an underlying qualifying condition for a Covid vaccine, anddid not removeits recommendation for vaccination in children from its vaccine schedule.

This all left Haldeman in a tough position. At work at the hospital, she and her colleagues in infectious disease medicine had no idea if she would be allowed to get the vaccine, although they all agreed she should. Haldeman previously had no issues getting vaccinated or boosted for Covid-19, and received a booster during her first pregnancy.

She made an appointment and went to the closest Walgreens. The staff there immediately noticed she was pregnant and told her they couldn’t administer the vaccine—they could only give it to her if she was immunocompromised, and they did not consider pregnancy to fall under that category. “It was very frustrating,” she said.

When asked for comment, a Walgreens spokesperson said that “Walgreens is proud to continue serving our patients as a trusted and convenient resource for immunizations” and will “continue to closely monitor and review all federal and state guidance related to vaccines.” The spokesperson clarified that the policy varies, state by state.

After being turned away, Haldeman called her primary care doctor to see if they could give her the vaccine, but they told her they didn’t have it in stock. The midwifery clinic didn’t either. No one had good advice to offer, other than calling around pharmacies until someone would do it.

So she called a nearby Safeway pharmacy. The person on the phone first said no, but when she objected, she was transferred to a pharmacist. The pharmacist said maybe she could get the vaccine if she got a prescription from her provider and brought that with her to the pharmacy, but didn’t guarantee it would work.

Armed with a prescription, she went to the nearest Safeway, only to discover that it didn’t have the vaccine in stock. At the second-closest Safeway, staff noticed she was pregnant and panicked, and had her sit in a waiting room. “I was in tears at this point, just so frustrated,” she said. “I wasted so much time.”

Haldeman eventually succeeded in getting her vaccination on her fourth attempt, but the experience left her unnerved and upset. “I had to advocate for myself so much to actually get the vaccine,” she said, recognizing that most people, especially those who are hesitant about vaccines in the first place, would likely give up. Moreover, the experience made her feel criminalized: “If someone’s treating you like you’re doing something illegal, then you’re going to assume that there’s something wrong with what you’re doing, even though the evidence is clearly very much in support of getting vaccinated while pregnant,” she said.

A company spokesperson toldThe New Republicthat Safeway is “committed to providing care that aligns with the latest public health recommendations … in accordance with CDC guidance.… Currently, individuals, including those pregnant, with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness remain eligible for vaccination.” Still, Haldeman had to get a prescription from a doctor to obtain the vaccine.

Haldeman’s experience makes clear that medical professionals, pharmacies, and people trying to get vaccinated are all weathering the fallout of RFK Jr.’s announcement restricting Covid-19 vaccines and the muddle that followed, and trying to figure out how to proceed amid the confusion.

“Secretary Kennedy’s decision is already causing substantial uncertainty and access issues,” said Doris Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and expert in legal issues around vaccines.

Just days before the ACIP committee was set to meet, RFK Jr.abruptly firedall 17 of its members—all of whom were preeminent vaccine experts—andappointed eight new ones. Of the new appointments, most were prominent vaccine skeptics, many of whom had clearconflicts of interest. Amid the egregious diversions from established procedures, it has gone virtually unnoticed that the new slate of ACIP members didn’t even meet avoting quorum.

The meeting went ahead, despiteobjections, and the committee ended up postponing the vote on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant people and children.

“I am not sorry that this group—several of which have clear anti-Covid-19 vaccine biases—did not vote on the issue,” said Reiss. “Apart fromDr. [Cody] Meissner, committee members lack subject matter expertise and several have clear anti-vaccine biases.”

The American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP,boycottedthe meeting—“We won’t lend out our name to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children’s health,” said the AAP president in avideoposted before the event.

The Evidence Collective, a group of public health experts and communicators, logged50 falsehoodsstated during the two-day meeting. “The members didn’t seem to understand basic vaccine studies,” said Jonathan Howard, a neurologist in New York and author of the bookWe Want Them Infected.

Though the committee did vote to approve RSV shots and (most) flu shots, the new ACIP chair, Covid and vaccine skeptic Martin Kulldorff, a statistician and epidemiologist, announced two new working groups that would reassess children’s vaccines schedule recommendations.

Both Reiss and Howard commended the CDC staffers for presenting information in an informative and accessible way, despite the significant challenges they faced.

Reiss said that the vote for Covid vaccines could be held in October, when the next quarterly ACIP meeting is scheduled, or sooner at a separately scheduled meeting. Until then, as Dr. Angela Branche, an infectious disease expert at the University of Rochester Medicine,told Rewire, “we are basically operating blind.”

In early July, the American Association of Pediatrics—along with several doctors, including a pregnant plaintiff doctor who also had trouble getting the vaccine—sued HHS, arguing RFK Jr.’s directive and firing of the ACIP members was “arbitrary and capricious” and has caused significant harm to doctors looking to stock and administer the vaccine.

Reiss added that having a plaintiff with standing, or one like the pregnant doctor, “Jane Doe,” who has clearly been directly impacted by the directive, strengthens the lawsuit. (Reiss is not affiliated with the lawsuit.)

“Pregnancy increases the risk of severe illness and complications from infectious disease, including preterm birth and stillbirth,” thelawsuit text states. “However, the Directive creates barriers to access to the vaccine and has left Jane and her husband overwhelmed with stress and uncertainty. Her worries are not just for herself, but also for the health and safety of her unborn child.”

The strongly worded lawsuit underscores the importance of ACIP not only in establishing vaccine recommendations but also in determining insurance coverage, state and local laws, and vaccination requirements in schools and medical settings.

RFK Jr.’s directive restricting vaccine access via X “breaks the promise that the Secretary made to the Senate and the American people not to make it difficult to get vaccines or discourage them,” the text states. “The Directive, unless vacated, will result in preventable deaths, including the unborn and newborns under six months old.”

It continues: “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”

Reiss thinksit’s highly possible to proveRFK Jr.’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious.” As she explained toThe New Republic, “In both the video and the directive, Secretary Kennedy provided very little explanation, let alone a thorough consideration of the existing evidence and a justification for deviating from past agency positions.”

In response to the lawsuit, the so-called “MAHA Institute” sent anunconvincing rebuttal to its subscribers.

Until a judge halts RFK Jr.’s directive, it will stand. Meanwhile, 80 medical associations reaffirmed their commitment to vaccination, while the University of Minnesota–based Vaccine Integrity Project isworking with a number of partnersto offer its own vaccine recommendations regardless of what the now-compromised ACIP decides.

The antidemocratic, anti-science actions at HHS go beyond RFK Jr., who has appointed like-minded henchmen like Jay Bhattacharya to head the National Institutes of Health and Dr. Vinay Prasad at the helm of the influential Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research arm of the Food and Drug Administration, or CBER.

Prasad, who I havewritten about in these pages, is overseeing a “consolidation of power” at CBER. He hasrepeatedly overruledFDA experts’ recommendations for Covid vaccines. He is behind the decree that they be restricted to people over 65 and those age 12 to 64 with underlying health conditions, according to Biospace, a life science news site. A July 9 memo by Prasad,riddled with egregious inaccuracies, argued that he felt “differently about certain aspects” of the FDA reviewer’s conclusions that Covid vaccines should remain broadly available.

“I think there has got to be a ton of frustration at the FDA with Prasad overruling them all based on vibes,” said Howard.

This alarming growth of authoritarianism at HHS is just the beginning. Although thevast majority of Americans,including Republicans, believe vaccines are safe, there will be considerable fallout from giving anti-vaxxers a mainstream platform of authority. In addition to confusion and mistrust, such sentiments have already led to ameasles outbreak, which RFK Jr. is grossly mishandling, and the looming threat of bird flu.

The consequences of these policies will be more transmission of preventable diseases and death, in a time when accessing health care is about to become more difficult, with thelargest Medicaid cuts in historyimminent.

Amid the horrors, it’s easy to forget that Covid-19 remains a threat. “We’ve all sort of gotten numb to it,” said Haldeman. But without tools available to fight it, we’re walking straight into another public health disaster: “It’s really dangerous.”

We have watched with increasing dismay and as the government ofUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyhas acted against political opponents, culminating in recent measures tostripthe country’s anti-corruption institutions of power amid thesanctioningof prominent political opponents, thedetainingof vocalskepticson apparently specious charges, and apatternof democratic backsliding. President Zelensky has been lionized as a hero, but these missteps are a reminder that all leaders are susceptible to errors.

Such missteps have inflamed Ukrainian civil society. Videos shared by Ukrainian anti-corruption activist leader Daria Kaleniuk show thousands of outraged protesters taking to the streets of Kyiv, in the first anti-government demonstration since the outbreak of Putin’s invasion, and what appears to be thelargest demonstrationsince the Maidan Revolution of 2014, which led to the ouster of pro-Russian Putin leader Viktor Yanukovych.

Capturing the sentiments of many, one Ukrainian activist, Kateryna Amelinasaid, “My husband is in the trenches and this is not what they are fighting for…this could be the destruction of 10 years of work by civil society.” These actions have provoked similar global outcry from Ukraine’s allies, including top EU leaders.

Zelensky,claimsthat these crackdowns are needed because anti-corruption investigations were tainted by Russian influence and were doingPutin’s bidding. Now, Ukraine’s domestic security police force has been busydetaininganti-corruption activists on supposed “links to Russia.” These crackdowns may fracture Ukrainian unity and undermine global support at a time when Ukraine can ill-afford such mistakes. The response of the Zelensky Administration tosmearanti-corruption probes as Russian propaganda is misguided and self-defeating, as many within Ukraine point out.

At the same time, we do recognize the fact that there has been too much corruption pervading the Ukrainian government. Former Deputy Chief of Staff Rostyslav Shurma was ensnared in ascandalwhere his brother’s company received subsidies from the Ukrainian government for solar plants in Russian-occupied territories. Former Agriculture Minister Mykola Solsky wasarrestedafter documents emerged suggesting his involvement in a land grab scheme, in which he apparently led co-conspirators in seizing 1,250 land plots totaling nearly 2,500 hectares. And Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Chernyshov was enveloped in a high-profile scandal where heallegedlyaccepted bribes in return for helping a powerful developer seize valuable land in Kyiv on the cheap. The list goes on with allegations of wrongdoing in everything fromquestionable privatizationstoembezzlementtoself-dealing.  With aid for Ukraine becoming a political lightning rod, sweeping credible allegations under the rug and pretending there is no problem is not the right move.

Time and time again, when existential challenges beckon, Zelensky has shown he can summon the courage and clarity to meet the moment. Already, we are told that Zelensky is considering a new bill which restores some of Ukraine’s anti-corruption infrastructure, which would be a positive first step. But much more needs to be done to restore shattered trust, and it’s not too late to right the course. Acknowledging mistakes and reversing course rather than digging in is a mark of true leadership.
