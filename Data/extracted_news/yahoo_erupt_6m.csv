This week, second through fifth grade students painted volcanoes made from plastic water bottles, cardboard and paper mache. Then they poured in the ingredients which, when combined, simulated lava flows.

Many of the students present, including Roland Nelson, age 6, said they had attended other group activities but the volcanoes were the favorite. Nelson, according to mother Beth Nelson, has read 100 books to date during the program.

Beth Nelson said the program is great, but lamented that it isn’t run throughout the entire year.

“They have so much fun,” she said, noting the children can get out, socialize and participate in the activities.

She also stated the library’s summer reading program was great for home-schoolers.

Lucas Clark, age 8, was also among those stating the volcano was his favorite activity. Older brother Jayden Richards, 10, said he preferred the puff painting. Clark said he had read nine books the past week, while Richards said he’d read seven in the same time frame.

Bella Wyatt, age 9, said she liked the volcanoes best as well. She said she likes to read the Cat Kid Comic Club books.

Her grandmother Anity Wyatt said the summer program was good because it gives children something to do.

Sibling trio Adalinda Rico, age 12, Daisy Rico, 10, and Mateo Rico, 6, were participants at Wednesday’s event. They agreed that making the erupting volcanoes was a favorite activity.

Adalinda enjoys reading books from the ""Dog Man"" and ""Baby-Sitter’s Club"" series. Daisy said she likes fantasy books while Mateo prefers super heroes.

Their mother Victoria Cardenas said the program was great because it encourages reading and increases reading skills. She also praised the book buck program saying it taught children to work for the things they want.

During the reading program, participants read books and turn in their reading logs to earn book bucks. Those book bucks can then be used to buy items from the program’s store such as books, bubbles, Barbies and other toys.

Reading program activity times are divided by age groups. Second- through fifth-grade students meet at 10:30 a.m. and teens meet at 1:30 p.m. Tuesdays. Children 18 months through first grade meet at 10:30 a.m. with an all-age activity scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Wednesdays.

Movie matinees are shown at 2 p.m. Mondays with ""Inside Out 2"" scheduled for July 7 and ""The Super Mario Bros."" movie for July 14.

“So far this summer, we have had an amazing and colorful time making paint, making slime and making friends,” said Samantha Lytle, children’s services coordinator.“There are two weeks left of summer reading but it's not too late to sign up and read to win prizes. Come make some colorful memories.”"

TikTok user @bbrookee20 posted the now widely shared 8-second clip on July 9, joking in the caption, “You thought the Magic Kingdom fireworks were the main event tonight.”

The short but dramatic video has quickly racked up views as fans of Disney World, and the platform, weigh in on the unexpected moment.

The video shows a man wearing a black t-shirt and an off-white baseball cap being forcefully pulled back during a shouting match with a woman in a black top. “Enough!” the man yells, as the woman snaps back with “Let go of me!” amid the escalating tension.

Three fellow guests can be seen stepping in to de-escalate the scene, grabbing the man by the shirt and trying to pull him away from the confrontation. As the woman backs away, she swats her arm toward him, raising the intensity of the already-tense moment.

The real showstopper, however, may have been the reaction from the Disney cast member behind the store counter. Visibly alarmed, the employee stands with her hands raised, palms facing outward, and her eyes darting nervously between the guests as the situation unfolds just feet away.

The incident took place inside of World of Disney located at Disney World's shopping center, Disney Springs.

Earlier this year, another fight made headlines at Shanghai Disneyland.

On May 31, a violent dispute allegedly sparked by a photo-bombing incident erupted inside the park.

According toViral Press, a couple became upset when a family of three appeared in the background of their photo booth pictures. Video footage shows the couple confronting the family’s father before launching into a physical attack. Shockingly, the woman appears to shove the family’s toddler in the face while she is being held by her mother, who immediately screams and falls to the ground.

Park security and bystanders rushed to intervene and break up the scuffle. Local media reported that both men involved suffered minor injuries, such as scratches and bruises. Thankfully, the toddler was not seriously hurt.

Unfortunately, this is far from an isolated trend. Over the past five years, several incidents of violence have been captured across various Disney parks.

In 2019, a viral fight atDisneylandin Anaheim shocked viewers when footage showed family members exchanging punches near Toontown.

At one point, the sound of children crying could be heard in the background. During another moment, an elderly woman, seemingly part of the group, stood up from her electric wheelchair and fell to the ground amid a scuffle between the two women.

The incident escalated dramatically before security intervened, and the footage was widely criticized for the delay in response.

Those involved were faced with multiple charges after footage of the incident went viral.

In July 2022,a brutal brawl broke out in Fantasylandnear Cinderella’s Castle at Magic Kingdom in Florida. The fight, reportedly sparked by a family refusing to move for a photo opportunity, resulted in multiple arrests and hospitalizations.

One of the individuals involved, who was taken to the hospital by ambulance with a significant chin injury, confirmed the incident in a written statement toWalt Disney World News Today.

“We got banned from Disney forever unless we contact the head,” the alleged participant wrote at the time. What happened afterward remains unclear.

In 2021, another altercation at Disneyland Paris gained attention when two families got into a shouting and shoving match near Sleeping Beauty Castle, reportedly over line-cutting accusations.

And in 2023,an argument between two guestson Main Street, U.S.A. at Disney reportedly turned physical after one allegedly bumped into the other’s stroller. Security arrived quickly, but not before several punches were thrown, all in front of stunned children and families.

These unsettling scenes serve as reminders that even in places built for wonder and joy, tempers can flare. With Disney parks around the world seeing record-breaking summer crowds, safety and courtesy among guests are more important than ever."

Yvette Digan, a 22-year-old Boston University exchange student from Hong Kong, claims she suffered burns, permanent disfigurements, and other injuries due to the explosion, which her attorneys blame on a bottle of 190-proof Everclear grain vodka, according to a lawsuit.

“I was invited to Zeta Psi to socialize and meet people because I was new in the area,” Digan recalled in court documents obtained by Boston 25 News. “We were minding our own business and having a conversation when the unthinkable happened.”

Digan’s attorneys allege that Everclear removed warnings from its bottles, stating it was safe near open flames and stoves.

Surveillance video shows multiple people sitting around a fire before an explosive fireball erupts, highlighting the dangerous circumstances leading up to the incident.

“Out of nowhere, I was set on fire and screaming. Multiple boys tackled me to take the fire out, and then they called the ambulance,” Digan explained in the documents. “It all became blurry, and I felt like I couldn’t feel my body or speak.”

The attorneys argue that the 95 percent ethanol in Everclear creates explosive vapors even at room temperature, posing significant risks.

The lawsuit raises concerns about the safety of high-proof alcohol products and the importance of adequate warning labels to prevent similar incidents.

Boulders of weathered, lichen-covered rock show how easy it is to overlook these new units. (Photo by Liv Wheeler/Montana State University)

Yellowstone’s geological history is one of the most intensely studied in North America.

Froma map drawn on a bison pelt by Native American tribestoBob Christiansen’s 1:125,000 scale map published in 2001, the resolution of Yellowstone maps only continues to evolve. Although these maps —especially those that show the geology— have created a solid foundation for tourists and researchers alike, many remote or poorly exposed areas of Yellowstone have been generalized at broad scales, now requiring geologists to revisit these regions.

Fixing Yellowstone: How an intact ecosystem set the stage for a wolf queen’s long reign

Their goal? To improve our understanding of all rocks that make up Yellowstone’s geologic history. But what happens when a rock previously mapped as a younger eruption is dated using new techniques and returns an age that doesn’t match anything in the geologic record? This is exactly what happened recently, when Montana State University geologists identified a new geological unit in the west part of Yellowstone National Park.

Yellowstone’s landscape tells a story written in ash, lava and time. Scientists have worked to understand that story bymapping volcanic rocksand using tools likeargon datingon individual minerals to determine when eruptions occurred.

Our current maps have identified three volumetrically major explosive eruptions separated by periods ofbasaltic lava flow activityand slower, thickerrhyolitic lava flows. One such group of lava flows, primarily located in the Madison Junction area, is known as the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series, which is dated between 1.28 million and 700,000 years ago. This is the time period between the formation of theHenrys Fork Caldera(1.3 million years ago) andYellowstone Caldera(631,000 years ago).

Until recently, the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series was believed to consist of non-explosive, effusive rhyolite lava flows; however, remapping in the area revealed a previously unrecognized volcanic unit. This unit — a dense, black, glassy rock — had been mapped as part of theLava Creek Tuff (LCT), Yellowstone’s youngest super eruption, which occurred around 631,000 years ago. Yet argon dating on this glassy rock returned an age of 780,000 years, making it older than the LCT and placing it within the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series.

Although not surprising — geologists often find more eruptive diversity within known units — this specific rock suggests that the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series is not just composed of oozy lava flows.

So, what exactly is this mystery rock? It is a vitrophyre — a volcanic rock with a glassy matrix formed by rapid cooling. When lava or pyroclastic (ashy) material erupts, it can cool so quickly that the molten material solidifies into volcanic glass before a crystalline matrix has time to grow. In vitrophyres, phenocrysts — larger, well-formed crystals —  are suspended in the glassy groundmass. These crystals grew slowly in the magma chamber before eruption, but the glass preserves the story of a rapid temperature drop during and immediately after eruption.

This vitrophyre probably represents a smaller explosive eruption associated with the Mount Jackson Rhyolite Series, different from the massive caldera-forming events, but still geologically significant. Such events might have produced ash plumes or pyroclastic flows that did not spread too far beyond the eruption source.

These combined ash and lava eruptions could have occurred more frequently in Yellowstone in the past but have gone unrecognized due to the limited resolution of older maps, burial by later eruptions, and the difficulty of preserving small amounts of ashy material in the landscape.

As scientists continue to write the story of Yellowstone’s eruptive history, remapping and dating are crucial for finding more of these overlooked units. If one previously unrecognized volcanic unit can be uncovered, how many more remain hidden in Yellowstone’s geologic record?

https://www.yahoo.com/news/crucial-years-guides-parents-puberty-194110061.html,2025-07-13 22:30:00,‘The Crucial Years’ guides parents on puberty and mental health,"SHREVEPORT, La. (KTAL/KMSS) – Most people would say that raising kids when they are 12-14 years old is one of the toughest periods of parenting, but what if it didn’t have to be?

Dr. Sheryl Gonzalez Ziegler, Psy.D., an acclaimed expert in children’s mental health, explores how to lay the foundation for your child’s teenage years in her book, “The Crucial Years: The Essential Guide to Mental Health and Modern Puberty in Middle Childhood.”

Astrology and self-discovery: A guide to understanding your birth chart

The “crucial years,” which Dr. Ziegler refers to as the “forgotten years,” are ages 6-12 and sometimes go overlooked in terms of child development. What some parents don’t realize is that children at this age are still heavily influenced by their parents, despite no longer being toddlers.

“It’s the perfect time to actually instill the things that matter to you, where your kid will soak it up,” Dr. Ziegler said. “Then, as they enter those teen years, they’ll be prepared for the things you’ve been warning them about or teaching them because they got the information when their brain was ripe for listening to you.”

One of the biggest topics in Dr. Ziegler’s book is teaching children to regulate their emotions, which means the ability to handle and calm themselves amid an event. Self-regulation can provide several short- and long-term mental health benefits, and can be achieved by learning what your children’s “window of tolerance” is.

“We all have a window of tolerance, what we can tolerate,” Dr. Ziegler said. “Think about it when you’re traveling. The flight got delayed once, a little frustrating. The flight is now cancelled…For a lot of people, that’s outside of their window. Now they’re angry, they’re cursing, they’re calling people, they’re in someone’s face. They’re outside of the window of tolerance. That’s what life is like for a lot of kids.”

Dr. Ziegler uses several visual metaphors in her book, including the “volcano” and the “iceberg,” to help children visualize their feelings.

“The anger volcano…we have lava that bubbles underneath the surface and then eventually…it erupts,” Dr. Ziegler said. “When we have the eruption, it’s not just at the person that you’re mad at. It goes everywhere.

“The iceberg is all the stuff we can’t see under the surface. This is perfect for the kid who comes in, does their work, and seems happy…What was under the surface was, ‘I felt like a loser. I felt like nobody liked me. I felt like I was dumb.’ It’s truly like the tip of an iceberg, and then all the water underneath to let them know nobody can see what’s under there.”

Dr. Ziegler also cautions parents not to blame kids specifically for when they misbehave, but rather the factors that led them to lash out or cause trouble.

“We use those words like ‘always’ and ‘never,'” Dr. Ziegler said. “They’re powerful words that can instill in a kid, ‘See? I’m a bad kid. My parents say I always ruin dinner. I always do this. I never help.’ Remember, 6-12, they’re like sponges and they’re taking it in.”

When it comes to putting pressure on children, studies have found that students whose parents value achievement more than kindness do worse academically and socially.

“When kids get the message of ‘You need to be a straight-A student,’ what they hear is, ‘I only have value, you only love me if I get straight-A’s,” Ziegler said. “Versus if you say to them, ‘Kindness is above everything. Everything else will fall into place in life, but what’s most important is that you care about your neighbors, that you care about your friends, that you’re an upstander.’

“When we are happy human beings, we tend to do well in other areas of our lives. When we are pressured human beings, we tend to crumble. We tend to make mistakes because we feel nervous and anxious.”

One chapter that Dr. Ziegler wanted to highlight was “Preteens and Success,” which talks about screen time and its effects on children.

“I do think that today’s child honestly can’t be fully successful until they manage a healthier digital life,” Dr. Ziegler said. “It’s not an anti-screens chapter. It gives you the data that I think is important and specifically focused on 6-12 year olds, which is unique. There are some truly detrimental outcomes from them. However, they are part of our lives. So, here are some things you can do to set up boundaries, restrictions, and monitoring conversations.”

You can read that chapter and more in Dr. Ziegler’s new book, “The Crucial Years,” available onAmazon,Barnes & Noble, and other retailers.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/epstein-files-saga-unfolded-within-224218036.html,2025-07-15 23:15:00,The Epstein Files: How the saga unfolded within Trump’s administration,"Jeffrey Epsteinmay have been dead for six years, but thecircumstances surrounding his deathand the evidence supporting federal charges of child sex traffickingcontinue to make headlines.

Most recently, they have caused aschism in MAGA world, reigniting anger from some supporters of PresidentDonald Trumpover his campaign promise to release the FBI files on the Epstein case, which the Department of Justice now sayswill not happen.

At the heart of the anger is thesupposed existence of a “client list”of celebrities, politicians, and other prominent associates, whom some claim that Epstein blackmailed over their alleged involvement in his trafficking ring.

Conspiracy theorists have long demanded its release, but now the Trump administration says there is no evidence it exists, despite Attorney GeneralPam Bondihaving said in February thatit was on her desk. Bondi now says she was referring to the overall case file.

The attorney general also said officials at the Justice Department were examining a “truckload” of evidence that had previously not been made public.

However, the department concluded that public disclosure would not be appropriate, and much of the material was sealed by a judge. This has added fuel to rampant speculation that Trump is on the alleged list, despite its apparent nonexistence.

This caused a storm among right-wing influencers, including commentatorTucker Carlson, activistLaura Loomer, and former Trump adviserSteve Bannon, who are outraged over this lack of transparency.

Here’s what you need to know about the case and why MAGA is up in arms.

Epstein was a wealthy and very well-connected financier who was arrested in 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges. He was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in New York City about a month after his arrest.

Investigators concluded he died by suicide, althoughmany people dispute this determination, including, most recently,a former occupant of the same cell. In addition, the “raw” video footage released by the Department of Justice of Epstein’s cell door in the hours before he was found dead had nearly three minutes cut out from it,a new report has claimed.

SocialiteGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, was charged with helping him abuse teenage girls and was convicted of sex trafficking at a 2021 trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Because the couple’s social circle includedroyals, presidents, and billionaires,the case gained massive attention and fueled some of the biggest conspiracy theories driving Trump’s supporters.

Trump himself was a friend of Epstein, and the two were photographed and filmed together on several occasions. In 2002, Trump described Epstein as a “terrific guy” whom he had known for 15 years, in an interview withNew Yorkmagazine.

He added: “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”

Being so well-connected, key figures in the MAGA movement have long propagated unsubstantiated claims that Epstein was murdered and that “deep state” actors in the government are hiding lists of his clients, videos of crimes being committed, and other evidence.

Among those figures were now-FBI DirectorKash Pateland his deputyDan Bongino, who both stoked conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein’s death, with the latter telling listeners in 2023 that there are people in the “Washington swamp who are not telling you the truth.”

In 2019, Trump himself suggested there was a cover-up and was asked on Fox News on the 2024 campaign trail if he would declassify documents relating to the case once he took office again — these became known as the “Epstein Files.”

Then-candidate Trump said he would, alongside files relating to 9/11 and the JFK assassination, but hedged his answer on Epstein, adding: “I think that less so because you don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phony stuff in there, because it’s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. But I think I would.”

In February, weeks after Trump’s inauguration, Bondi was asked during a Fox News interview whether the DOJ would release the alleged client list. She responded: “It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that.”

A few days later, Bondi told the network that the Justice Department planned to publish “a lot of flight logs” and “a lot of names” related to Epstein.

On February 27, far-right influencers, includingJack Posobiecand Scott Presler, as well as the individuals behind the LibsofTikTok and DC_Draino accounts, were invited to an event at the White House and provided with binders marked“The Epstein Files: Phase 1”and “Declassified.”

After jubilant images of the group holding the binders aloft were published, their excitement quickly faded when they realized that the content was already almost entirely in the public domain. Some were outraged and blamed Bondi.

Loomer blasted the handling of the publication, writing on X: ""The Epstein files were released in an unprofessional manner with paid, partisan social media influencers to curate their binders for us. I can't trust anything in the binder. Neither should you.""

In May, Bondi claimed there were “tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn,” adding further fuel to conspiracy theories that powerful people were being protected and the decision to release “Phase 1” had been to allow time for some kind of cover-up.

Bondi pushed back on this notion, saying: “It’s a new administration and everything is going to come out to the public.”

Multiple people who worked on the criminal cases of Epstein and Maxwell told The Associated Press that they had not seen and were unaware of a trove of recordings similar to what Bondi had referenced.

As the months-long bromance between Trump and Tesla CEOElon Muskcame to a spectacular end with asocial media battle for the ages, the topic of Epstein arose in one of the most explosive posts exchanged that day.

Musk tweeted: “Files linked to the investigation of convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epsteinhave emerged as a point of fixation for Trump and his allies and right-wing media figures.

“Time to drop the really big bomb:Donald Trumpis in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”

Shortly after, he wrote: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”

Later, perhaps as cooler heads prevailed, Musk deleted the tweet.

At the close of the Independence Day federal holiday weekend, the Justice Department announced in a two-page memo, in conjunction with the FBI, that there was no client list and no additional files relating to the case would be made public.

The DOJ, it said, had determined that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted,” much was sealed by a court to protect Epstein’s victims, and “only a fraction of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”

Additionally, the memo said that no further charges were expected as investigators “did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.”

Also released were hours of footage, which officials say further confirms Epstein died by suicide while in custody in his jail cell in Manhattan in 2019.

The 11-hour video of Epstein’s final hours in New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center had one minute of footage missing, and forensic experts concluded that the clip had been “modified,” adding fuel to the fire.

While the memo said the government’s highest priority was combatting child exploitation, it added: “Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.”

Right-wing conspiracy theories and renewed suspicions of a cover-up went into overdrive over this retreat by Bondi.

Former Trump adviser Bannon questioned if the administration is really as transparent as it claims to be. Loomer called on Bondi to resign “for lying to the American people,” a call echoed by fellow MAGA influencer Glenn Beck.

PodcasterMegyn Kellycalled Bondi “either lazy or incompetent,” and conspiracy theoristAlex Jonesaccused the Trump administration of being part of the cover-up.

In a Cabinet meeting on July 8, with reporters present, Trump interrupted a question on the topic, saying: “Are you still talking aboutJeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. You're asking — we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.”

Bondi then clarified her past comments on the case: “In February, I did an interview on Fox, and it's been getting a lot of attention because I said I was asked a question about the client list, and my response was, it's sitting on my desk to be reviewed, meaning the file along with the JFK, MLK files as well. That's what I meant by that.”

Concerning her later comments about the “tens of thousands” of videos, she said that they had “turned out to be child porn downloaded by that disgusting Jeffrey Epstein.”

Musk once again joined the conversation, posting on X: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”

The former DOGE administrator also claimed, with no evidence, that his nemesis, Bannon, was in the files.

The most public split within the Trump administration emerged between Bondi and Bongino, with the deputy FBI director expressing dissatisfaction with how the memo had been released.He told allies that he may resignas the storm over the memo continued within MAGA world.

According to reports, the two had a fiery confrontation with Bongino attacking Bondi for her handling of the situation.

To try and diffuse speculation about infighting within the administration, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on X that he had personally worked with both Bongino and Patel on the memo.

“All of us signed off on the contents of the memo and the conclusions stated in the memo,” Blanche wrote. “The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo's composition and release is patently false.”

This provoked an angry response from Loomer, who asked why no one had signed their name on the memo, speculating that the FBI had wanted to release more information and Bondi — whom she refers to as “Blondi” — had refused.

“Blondi is literally blowing up the Trump admin by concealing information, spending time on Fox News lying to MAGA base and by releasing contradictory statements,” wrote Loomer on X.

Only one person could attempt to diffuse internal strife within the administration, and so on Saturday, the president took to Truth Social and, in an extraordinarily lengthy post, defended Bondi amid continued calls for her resignation from his base.

Trump praised her for doing a “fantastic job” and urged his “boys” and “gals” in MAGA world to stop attacking her.

“What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals?’” Trump wrote. “They’re all going after Attorney GeneralPam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening.”

“We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and 'selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump protested.

The president’s post did little to quell the anger from his base, who continued to call for the release of the files.

His first-term national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen.Michael Flynn, wrote on X: “@realdonaldtrump please understand the EPSTEIN AFFAIR is not going away.”

He added that failing to address unanswered questions about Epstein would make facing other national challenges “much harder.”

Musk once again commented on X, replying to a post: Seriously. He [Trump] said ‘Epstein’ half a dozen times while telling everyone to stop talking about Epstein. Just release the files as promised.”

On the same day, rumors circulated that Patel, like Bongino, was also considering leaving the FBI. The director wrote on X that it is an honor to serve the president and “I'll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me.”

The following day, asked about Bongino’s future, Trump said he was in “good shape,” adding: “I spoke to him today,Dan Bongino, very good guy. I've known him a long time.”

Before this, it had been reported thatTrump was angry at Bonginoover the situation.

The president’s daughter-in-law appeared to be off-message in terms of tamping down the scandal when she told Bennie Johnson on his podcast that there needed to be “more transparency” from the administration regarding the Epstein case and thatmore information would be released“sooner rather than later.”

On the same day, House Minority LeaderHakeem Jeffriestold reporters at a news conference that there were only two things possibly be happening regarding the case.

“Option one,Donald Trump,Pam Bondi, and the MAGA extremists intentionally lied to the American people for years about the Jeffrey Epstein situation,” he said.

“Option two is that, in fact, there's reason for the American people to be concerned as it relates to what information has not been released that could be damaging to the Trump administration and the friends and family of the Trump administration and their billionaire, corrupt supporters. And so, they're actively engaging in a cover-up,” Jeffries continued.

He added that if the administration was “hiding something,” it was up to Congress to “uncover the truth for the American people.”

Later, Texas Democratic Rep. Marc Beasey introduced a resolution calling for the immediate release of all unclassified Epstein Files. That echoed calls from MAGA Republicans.

“America deserves the truth about Jeffrey Epstein and the rich powerful elites in his circle,” Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X Monday.

Nevertheless, House Republicans blocked another Democrat push to force the Trump administration to release the “FULL” Epstein files.

Seizing on growing MAGA infighting, California RepresentativeRo Khannaintroduced an amendment to the GENIUS Act on Monday, calling on Bondi to compile and release all Epstein records within 30 days.

Late Monday evening, the House Rules Committee voted 7–5 to block the proposal from reaching the lower chamber.

On Tuesday, with the scandal refusing to die down, Trump told reporters on the South Lawn that Bondi should release “whatever she thinks is credible” on Epstein.

When asked if Bondi had informed him that his name appeared in the file, the president said no and that he had received a “very quick briefing” on the review of the Epstein files before the release of the memo a week earlier. He thenaccused his predecessors of making up the files.

“And in terms of the credibility of the different things that they've seen, and I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden -- and you know, we and we went through years of that with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, with all of the different things that we had to go through,” Trump said.

“We've gone through years of it, but she's handled it very well, and it's going to be up to her,” Trump said of Bondi. “Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.”

Later in the day, Trump addressed it yet again.

“I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff. I think really only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going,” he told reporters at Joint Base Andrews.

Also on Tuesday, podcasterJoe Rogancriticized the DOJ’s handling of the Epstein files as House SpeakerMike Johnsonand other Republicansbroke away from the president over the issue, stating that he was “for transparency” and that even though it was a “very delicate subject,” everything should be made public to let people decide.

Further, a day after saying he was “done talking about” Epstein and would “trust my friends in the government,” podcaster and Turning Point USA founderCharlie Kirkreversed course and said he meant “yesterday” andwill continue to discuss it,despite the president’s plea for MAGA world figures to let the issue die out.

MAGA Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert called forfailed Attorney General nominee Matt Gaetzto lead aspecial counsel investigation into the filesto deliver the “truth.”

Gaetz’s nomination was derailed over allegations that he paid for sex, including with a 17-year-old girl. He denies any wrongdoing, but a bombshellHouse Ethics Committee reportdetailed his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use while he was in Congress.

With the Epstein Files and MAGA world rift dominating the news cycle, Trump took to Truth Social, writing a lengthy post tying the scandal to a multitude of past “scams and hoaxes,” pushed by the “Radical Left Democrats.”

The president thenlashed out at his MAGA base, claiming his “PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker.”

“I don’t want their support anymore!” Trump wrote.

In an Oval Office appearance on Wednesday following the post, Trump said he had “lost a lot of faith in certain people” as he tried to move past the story.

“It’s all been a big hoax,” he told reporters. “It’s perpetrated by the Democrats, and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net.”

He complained that Bondi has been “waylaid” over her handling of the case and has given out all “credible information” about the wealthy financier. “If she finds anymore credible information she’ll give that, too,” Trump said. ”What more can she do than that?”

Talking toPolitico, Loomer warned that the scandal over the Epstein filescould consume Trump’s presidency, reiterating an earlier call for a special counsel to investigate.

Later, in a pre-taped interview with Real America’s Voice, Trump adds: “All my supporters want to talk about is the Jeffrey Epstein hoax. It’s unbelievable ... It’s a disgrace. ... I’m going to remember.”

Kirk attempted some damage control on Trump’s behalf on his podcast: “Don’t take too seriously this whole Truth Social here ... I don’t believe he was trying to insult anybody personally.”

However, he is clearly still frustrated by the administration: “We are now Wednesday, going into Thursday. People are very, very confused, and some people are very disappointed and mad.”

He added: “We made so much progress with Gen Z, and this is a big vulnerability. Online, on TikTok, this story is not landing well. Let’s fix this, and we can.”

Anger at the Trump administration for its reversal on the Epstein case continued on Thursday morning ahead of a White House briefing at which Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked multiple questions about the Epstein files saga.

Asked what about the Epstein case, which featured multiple victims who testified about being trafficked and raped by the late sex offender, was a “hoax,” as Trump had posted, Leavitt ignored the president’s claim that the entire matter had been made up, and instead saidthe “hoax” status stems from the fact that Democrats are now joining his supportersin pushing for the case files to be made public.

“The President is referring to the fact that Democrats have now seized on this as if they ever wanted transparency when it comes to Jeffrey Epstein, which is an asinine suggestion for any Democrat to make,” she said, adding that over four years in the Biden presidency “they didn’t do a dang thing” about the case.

After rumors circulated all day about a coming bombshell report fromThe Wall Street Journal, in the evening the outletpublished a report about a 50th birthday greetingthat the president reportedly sent Epstein in 2003, which was described as including a sexually suggestive drawing and a reference to “secrets” both men shared.

On Truth Social, a furious Trump called the letter “FAKE,” saying it was “not my words and, “I don’t draw pictures,” despitemultiple examples of him doing so in the past. Referring to Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the paper, the president wrote:“I’m going to sue his ass off.”

Following the weeks of uproar over the Epstein files,Trump asked Bondi to release certain documentsand relevant grand jury testimony.

He wrote on Truth Social: “Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!”

Two minutes later, Bondi tweeted: “President Trump—we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.”"

The Sundhnukur volcano, located on the Reykjanes Peninsula, began erupting early Wednesday morning, according to officials.

After two hours of seismic activity, the volcano began erupting at the Sundhnukur crater range -- about 30 miles southwest of Reykjavik -- just before 4 a.m. local time, theIcelandic Meteorological Officeannounced.

A fissure about 1.5 miles long opened up at the Sundhnúkur crater row as a result of the eruption, aerial surveys by the Icelandic Coast Guard showed. A second, smaller fissure measuring about .3 miles was created west of Fagradalsfjall, according to the Met Office.

""Witch's hair"" -- strands of volcanic glass often produced by lava fountaining activity, also referred to as ""Pele's hair"" -- was seen drifting in the wind, the Met Office said. Contact with the material can cause skin and eye irritation.

In addition, high levels of gas pollution were measured nearby in Reykjanesbær, but levels were decreasing in the hours after the eruption began, officials said.

Places like Grindavik, a nearby fishing town, and the Blue Lagoon, the geothermal spa that is one of the country's most iconic tourist sites, were among the locations instructed by officials to evacuate, public broadcasterRUVreported.

The town of Grindavik has experienced repeated threats in recent years after the once-dormant volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula began erupting again after 800 years of no activity.

Iceland is known as a hot spot for volcanic activity. There are32 active volcano systemsin the region spread across three rift zones, all part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a mountain range that mostly runs down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

In addition, there is an ""excessively high production of magma"" in the region, Thomas Algeo, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Cincinnati, told ABC News in November after the eruption triggered evacuations at Grindavik and the Blue Lagoon.

West Iceland's volcano is a rift activity volcano, which involves the earth being pulled apart in two different directions through the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, rather than a cone erupting magma through a central pipe, Algeo said.

Once the lava erupts, the pressure is relieved and magma starts to fill into the shallow storage zone below -- repressurizing the system and setting the stage for the next eruption.

The style of eruption is ""much less dangerous, because most of the activity involves slow-moving basaltic lava flows,"" Algeo said.

These types of eruptions offer ""spectacular"" views because large supplies of magma ooze out of the fissures once they open up, Tobias Fischer, director of the Volatiles Laboratory at the University of New Mexico, told ABC News in November.

MORE: Mile-deep underwater volcano could erupt off West Coast this year, scientists say

There have been 11 eruptions at the volcano in southwestern Iceland since it became active again in 2021, according to the Met Office.

Iceland's western rift zone, also known as the Reykjanes-Langjökull rift zone, was active prior to the 13th century. Fischer said. These types of eruptions tend to occur every 1,000 years or so.

MORE: Icelandic volcano previously dormant for 800 years erupting again

During the last 800 years, the majority of volcanic activity has been in the north and east volcanic zones -- both lightly populated regions. However, western Iceland, which includes he capital of Reykjavik, is highly populated.

The location of the latest eruption is favorable because lava flows will likely not threaten any infrastructure, Minney Sigurðardóttir, a natural hazard specialist at Met Office, told RUV."

Yvette Digan showed Boston 25 News second and third degree burns on about a third of body during a sit-down interview.

She said she suffered those agonizing injuries at Zeta Psi fraternity back in May.

Surveillance video shows multiple people gathered around a fire before an explosive fireball erupts.

A lawsuit filed by Digan said a Zeta Psi fraternity member “negligently poured a highly flammable liquid” on the fire.

Digan identifies that liquid as 190-proof Everclear.

“I wasn’t even paying attention, and suddenly, I was on fire, screaming for my life,” Digan told Boston 25 News. “I’ve never been in that much pain before.”

Digan said she was tackled by several witnesses who helped get the fire out.

She was taken to UMass Memorial Medical Center before she was flown to Massachusetts General Hospital with burns on her legs, her left hand, chest, and breasts.

The 22-year-old spent nearly a month in the hospital and received multiple skin graft surgeries.

“I’m in pain every day. Waking up in the morning, I remember, and going to sleep at night, I also have discomfort,” said Digan. “It’s just been a rollercoaster.”

Digan is suing Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Zeta Psi, and Luxco, the maker of Everclear grain alcohol.

A lawsuit accuses the company of knowingly removing fire hazard warnings despite safety risks and “marketing Everclear as a multi-purpose product safe for use near stoves and open flames.”

“Obviously, this Everclear is extremely dangerous,” said attorney Adam Clermont. “The product is still on sale in Massachusetts at liquor stores. It’s still advertised on sale on its website. Nobody seems to care.”

Boston 25 News reached out to Luxco for comment and have not yet heard back.

A Worcester Polytechnic Institute spokesperson said it does not comment on active litigation.

The incident that left Digan and a young man with burn injuries is currently under investigation by Worcester Police and fire investigators.

Digan is still undergoing occupational therapy and counseling and has a long road to recovery ahead.

She’s hoping to stay in Boston beyond this summer to continue receiving treatment at Mass General Hospital.

A video authentically shows U.S. President Donald Trump jocularly mouthing the words ""It's true"" or ""That's true"" after someone says he's a sexual predator during a 2006 appearance on ""The Howard Stern Show.""

Rating:

A rumor that circulated online in July 2025 claimed a video showed U.S. President Donald Trumpjocularly mouthing the words ""It's true"" or ""That's true"" after someone says he's a sexual predator during a 2006 appearance on ""The Howard Stern Show.""

Users shared the old clip from the longtime SiriusXMsatellite radio showamid renewed interest in Trump's connections toconvicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, Trump's past filled with numerouswomenallegingsexual impropriety on his part, andauthenticpicturesand avideoshowing Trump with the deceased financier, as well asmorephotosof Trump with Epstein's associate,convicted sex traffickerGhislaine Maxwell. In a magazine article from 2002, TrumpcalledEpsteina ""terrific guy,"" and added, ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

As an example of users sharing the video, on July 15, an X userposted(archived) the clip with the imprinted caption, ""Trump says, 'That's true,' when accused of being a sexual predator on Howard Stern, 2006."" The post received more than 1 million views, and featured a text caption asking of Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., also present for the interview, ""What exactly is so funny about your dad being a sexual predator?"" The end of the video displays the words, ""He literally muttered the words 'that's true,'"" then shows a zoomed-in view of Trump allegedly making the remark.

Some usersexpressedskepticismabout the video's authenticity,includingmentionsof potential artificial-intelligence manipulation. However an examination of the evidence confirmed the clip as genuine, and that no one altered it with AI or video editing software.

The clip, taken from a half-hour interview filled with jokes, shows Trump smiling, mildly laughing and quietly mouthing the words ""It's true"" or ""That's true."" Stern then laughingly repeats Trump's remark as ""It's true."" The larger context surrounding this moment in the interview appears later in this story.

Snopes emailed the White House to ask about the years-old video. White House spokesperson Harrison Fields responded by asking for our deadline. We shared our deadline but did not receive a response by that given time on the following day. We will update this story if we receive more information.

Thanks to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine website, theaudio recordingfrom the radio show's episode remains available via an archived capture of the trumponstern.com website. The pertinent part of the conversation begins at around the 22:40 mark. Also, the Fourble.co.ukwebsiteincludes a link to thefull episodelabeled ""33. 022706-cf(44.9Mb),"" with the relevant moment starting at the 2:12:22 mark.

Further, while the Inside Edition YouTube channel features areport(archived) about the video with an Oct. 14, 2016, upload date, they presented the pertinent part of the conversation, beginning at the 0:19 mark, with out-of-sync audio. People magazine also published an article, alsoarchivedby the Wayback Machine, about the clip on the same day, noting that Trump was ""apparently saying, 'That's true. That's true.'"" As of July 2025, that storyno longer appearson the People.com website.

We foundanother clipfrom the interview but did not locate a video showing the full conversation or episode.

On Feb. 27, 2006, Trump, along with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., sat for an interview filled with jokes and laughs in Stern's New York studio, to promote that same evening's fifth-season premiere of their reality TV series, ""The Apprentice."" In the latter half of the interview, Stern asked Ivanka Trump, then 24, about her dating life, including her former relationship with film producer James ""Bingo"" Gubelmann. Stern also repeatedly pressed Donald Trump on whether he liked Gubelmann, to which Trump responded by calling him a ""nice guy.""

The interview continued with Stern believing Trump disliked Gubelmann, before going into the moment when Stern asked Trump about the dangers of women encountering sexual predators:

STERN: And you didn't give into [Gubelmann] … you didn't give into him sexually, I hope? You did not give into him sexually?

IVANKA TRUMP:(talking as if smiling)Of course not, Howard.

STERN: Good.

IVANKA TRUMP: Of course not.

STERN: You're still a virgin, I assume?

IVANKA TRUMP: Of course.

ARTIE LANGE: Hey Howard?

STERN: Donald, do you ever discuss sex with your daughter?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

STERN: You do not?

DONALD TRUMP: No.

STERN: You've never sat her down …

IVANKA TRUMP:(laughing)And I have a feeling we're not going to here.

STERN: Well, maybe we need to bring this up. Donald, seriously … you, you, you know about sexual predators and things like that, I mean …?

DONALD TRUMP: Right.

ROBIN QUIVERS: You are one!

(room erupts into laughter)

STERN: All right, that, I wasn't going to say that, but uh …

(Trump mouths the words ""It's true"" or ""That's true"" toward Ivanka)

STERN:(laughing and repeating Trump's remark)""It's true.""

(Quivers laughing loudly)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Oh my God.

STERN: But I mean, seriously, that's an uncomfortable topic for you, as a father?

DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I think so. I mean, the kids probably know more about it than I do anyway when you get right down to it.

STERN: Yeah.

DONALD TRUMP: But they've been good kids. They've been always hardworking. They've gotten tremendous marks in schools, and no matter where they went. And you know, I'm very proud of them, and now they're in business with me. Don has been in longer. He's doing a fantastic job. Ivanka just came in recently.

The reposted radio show clip circulated at a time of high tensions in summer 2025, in the weeks after tech billionaire Elon Musk, former adviser to Trump,alleged, without providing evidence, that the president appears in damning, undisclosed files associated with Epstein's acts. ""That is the real reason why they have not been made public,"" Musk added, before deleting thepost.

Then, in early July 2025, the Department of Justice and FBI announced in amemorandumthat no Epstein ""client list"" existed, despite Attorney General Pam Bondi claiming on Fox News in February 2025 that it was on her desk for review. After the memo's release, Bondi sought toclarifyher earlier remarks, claiming ""on my desk"" simply referenced a general file related to Epstein, and not a ""client list.""

Trump alsocalledEpstein a ""creep"" and evenslammedsome of his own supporters as ""stupid"" for allegedly falling for an unspecified ""hoax"" involving Epstein's case that he said was ""perpetrated by the Democrats."" However, Trump himselfsaidin a June 2024 interview, ""I would,"" to the question of releasing documents related to Epstein's case. Vice President JD Vance, as well as others appointed by Trump, also previouslystressedthe importance of releasing the Epstein case files.

In the video clip, which has been viewed millions of times, Astronomer CEO Andy Byron can be seen with his arms around Astronomer Chief People Officer, Kristin Cabot.

“Oh, look at these two,” Coldplay frontman Chris Martin can be heard saying as the camera pans on the couple. Cabot, realizing they’re on camera, hurriedly covers her face while Byron, who is married to someone else, slinks to the floor in an attempt to escape the frame.

“Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” Martin quips as the crowd erupts with laughter.

Since then, Byron has taken his LinkedIn page offline and his wife, Megan Kerrigan Byron reportedly first removed her last name and then deleted her Facebook profile. A statement, purportedly from Andy Byron, that quotes Coldplay lyrics has also circulated.

The cringeworthy moment has also become the subject of countless memes, involving everything from Yankees fans to Jeffrey Epstein and President Donald Trump.

On Friday,Astronomer said on LinkedInthat the CEO has not put out any statement and that “reports saying otherwise are all incorrect.” The company also said its Board of Directors had initiated a formal investigation into the matter and would “have additional details to share very shortly.”

The fighting in Sweida, the southern province bordering Jordan and near Israel, began last week between militiamen from the Druze religious minority and Sunni Muslim tribes. It soon embroiled Syrian government forces and Israel in a chaotic battlefield that saw hundreds killed — some in sectarian-fueled revenge attacks — and more than 128,000 people displaced before a U.S.-backed ceasefire was announced Sunday.

The violence underscores the challenges facing the government of President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a rebel-turned-politician whose armed faction spearheaded the ouster of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in December. Since then, Al-Sharaa’s Islamist-dominated government has struggled to win the trust of minority communities in the country and failed to persuade militias formed during the civil war to disarm or fall under Damascus’ authority.

Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening in Sweida and why many believe it could derail Syria’s delicate postwar recovery.

Before the fighting erupted July 13, tensions were already high after a spate of kidnappings and robberies between Druze communities in Sweida and nearby Bedouin tribes.

As the unrest grew into open conflict involving Druze militias and armed Bedouins, the government dispatched its forces to stop the fighting. But some Druze leaders said the government aided the Bedouins instead; they also accused government-aligned security personnel of committing sectarian-motivated rampages, looting and executions against Druze civilians.

Read more:Sectarian violence erupts again in Syria, leaving at least 160 dead

Druze militias launched a counterattack and retaliated with a wave of killings and kidnappings against Bedouin fighters and civilians. Israel entered the fray with an airstrike campaign targeting Syria's security forces and tanks, as well as the army headquarters and the presidential palace in Damascus, the capital.

The violence left roughly 1,260 dead, most of themDruzefighters and civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain. It also said government forces carried out summary executions. Included in the death toll are hundreds of state security personnel.

The Druze, who make up roughly 3% of Syria’s population, are members of a syncretic religion that emerged in the 11th century as an offshoot of Shiite Islam. There are roughly 1 million Druze worldwide, more than half of them in Syria, and most of the rest in Lebanon, Israel and the Golan Heights, which Israel has illegally occupied — according to international law — since 1967.

During the civil war, the Druze were largely unwilling to ally with Assad but were wary of the opposition, which was dominated by hard-line Sunni Islamist groups, some of whom viewed Druze as infidels. The Druze formed militias for protection.

When Assad fell, many Druze celebrated. But some spiritual and militia leaders — like other minority communities across the country — remained suspicious of Al-Sharaa and his Islamist past, which once included affiliation with the terrorist network Al Qaeda. They resisted his calls to disarm and insisted they would cede power only to a representative government.

Waves of sectarian attacks have only reinforced their suspicions of Al-Sharaa: In March, government-linked factions massacred about 1,500 people, mostly from the Alawite sect, and in May, clashes in Druze-majority areas near the capital left 39 people dead.

Israel has entrenched itself in the neighboring country since Assad’s fall, with warplanes launching a wide-scale attack to destroy the Syrian army’s arsenal even as Israeli tanks and troopsblitzed into Syriaand commandeered villages near the border.

Since then, it has consolidated its presence and operated ever deeper in Syrian territory, justifying the moves as necessary for its security and to stop armed groups, government-aligned or otherwise, from launching attacks on Israel from Syrian territory.

Israel has also imposed what is in effect a demilitarized zone over southern Syria, including Sweida, preventing the Syrian army from establishing its authority over the region.

Another reason for Israel’s intervention is its own Druze population, a vocal minority of about 145,000 people, some of whom serve in the Israeli military. Over the last few months, Israeli troops have offered assistance to Syrian Druze communities. And when the Sweida fighting began, Israeli Druze citizens demonstrated near the border, calling on the Israeli military to protect their fellow Druze in Syria.

Despite those overtures, many Syrian Druze fear Israel’s growing presence in their areas and have sought a diplomatic resolution to their differences with the Syrian government. Others, such as Hikmat al-Hijri, an influential Druze spiritual leader opposed to Al-Sharaa, have repeatedly called for foreign protection.

Hours after the ceasefire took effect late Sunday, the Syrian government evacuated about 1,500 Bedouin family members trapped in Sweida city. Druze civilians were to be evacuated at a later time. Other phases of the truce will see the release of detained Bedouin fighters and the bodies of Bedouins killed in the fighting.

The U.S. was involved in brokering the ceasefire. More generally, Trump administration officials have thrown their support behind Al-Sharaa, lifting years-old sanctions that had all but choked the country’s economy and shepherding diplomatic contacts with Israel.

Speaking to reporters Monday in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said Syrian authorities needed to be held accountable for violations but “they also need to be given the responsibility that” is theirs.

Earlier, in an interview with the Associated Press, he deplored the killings but said the Syrian government was acting “as best [it] can as a nascent government with very few resources to address the multiplicity of issues that arise in trying to bring a diverse society together.”

He also suggested Israel wasn’t interested in seeing a strong Syria.

“Strong nation-statesare a threat.Especially, Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel,” he said. But in Syria, he said, “I think all of the minority communities are smart enough to say, ‘We’re better off together, centralized.’”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/summer-anti-migrant-riots-suit-050000291.html,2025-07-24 07:00:00,A summer of anti-migrant riots would suit our elites down to the ground,"Here’s a funny story.

We learnt this week that on March 25 2004, David Blunkett urged Tony Blairnot to release a secret Home Office reportthat laid bare the public’s anger about immigration.

In “the wrong hands”, fretted the then home secretary, its findings could be “explosive”. Because, according to the report, which was based on discussions from 27 focus groups, voters overwhelmingly agreed that “our borders are completely open and overrun”.

At first glance, the news above might not seem terribly amusing. But it may prompt some dark, mirthless laughter when you consider that in the five years prior, net immigration was running at 158,000 a year. Which just goes to show how big a mess we’re in now. Because let’s face it: if netimmigrationwere 158,000 a year today, in 2025, our current Government would be hailing it as a spectacular triumph.

Of course it would.

Every day,Labourministers would be bragging about the tough action they’d taken to achieve this awe-inspiringly low number. “In 2023, net immigration was almost a million. So to reduce it to a mere 158,000 is a roaring success for this Government. Resounding proof that we in the Labour Party have always listened to the public’s concerns…”

At any rate, given the ever-increasing porousness of Britain’s borders over the past two decades, it’s hardly a surprise that so many people are now deciding to make their displeasure a touch more vocal. Hence the protests that have taken place, in recent days, outsideasylum hotels in Essex, Norfolk and east London.

One aspect of this trend, however, does puzzle me. According to various reports in the media, the Government fears that such protests could turn violent.

Indeed they could. I merely wonder whether “fear” is the right word to describe the Government’s feelings. Because, to be brutally frank, a summer of anti-migrant riots would suit our elites down to the ground.

Horrifying as any violence would seem, it would actually make life easier for the powers that be – because it would enable them to paint all objections to asylum hotels, and mass immigration in general, as “far-Right”.

Left-wing media outlets would obligingly proclaim that the whole frightful business was a cynically co-ordinated plot by racist thugs, nothing more. And just like last summer, in the wake of Southport, Sir Keir Starmer could make a big show of looking “prime ministerial”, by sternly pledging that all offenders – including those,like Lucy Connolly, who made unacceptable posts on social media – would be “fast-tracked” to prison. Once the police had rounded up the thugs and restored order, the nation would be grateful and relieved.

But imagine, instead, that no such violence erupts – and all we see, in towns and cities across Britain, are peaceful protests by ordinary, law-abiding members of the public. No opportunistic skinheads with swastika tattoos. Just average families voicing their disquiet about what’s being done to their local area against their will, and expressing their worries about crime, as in Epping, Essex, where a 38-year-old asylum seeker has beencharged with sexually assaultinga 14-year-old girl. Hadush Kebatu, from Ethiopia, denies any wrongdoing.

For our elites, peaceful protests would present a far thornier problem than riots, because it would be so much harder to dismiss all the participants as hate-crazed, bloodthirsty white supremacists. And so, for once, they might actually have to listen to the public – and, even worse, do what the public wants.

Still, there’s no denying that unrest is possible. The question is: who or what might bring it about? On Tuesday, Nigel Farage accused Essex police of trying to “force a confrontation” by escorting Left-wing counter-protesters to the demonstration in Epping.

Assistant chief constable Stuart Hooper, however, insisted they only offered assistance because “the police have a duty to facilitate free assembly”.

Do they? That’s interesting, because last year anofficer from the Met threatened a Jewish man with arrestif he remained in the vicinity of an anti-Israel march in London.

“I’m not accusing you of anything,” said the officer, “but I’m worried about the reaction to your presence.” A curiously different approach. But perhaps one’s right to free assembly is dependent on where one is. Or who.

All we can say for sure is this: anyone who resorts to violence at these protests will not be helping to upend the status quo.

Instead, they’ll be helping to maintain it.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/icc-convicts-central-african-republic-181503537.html,2025-07-24 19:30:00,ICC convicts Central African Republic rebels over war crimes,"The International Criminal Court has convicted two leaders of a predominantly Christian rebel group in the Central African Republic for multiple war crimes committed against Muslim civilians during the country’s civil war in 2013 and 2014, sentencing each to more than a decade in prison.

The former president of the CAR Football Federation, Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona, along with Alfred Yekatom, a rebel leader known as “Rambo,” were found guilty on Thursday of their involvement in atrocities including murder, torture and attacking civilians.

The court sentenced Yekatom to 15 years for 20 war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Ngaissona received 12 years for 28 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The charges stem from their roles as senior leaders in a militia known as the anti-Balaka, which was formed in 2013 after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels stormed the capital Bangui in March of that year and toppled then-President Francois Bozize, a Christian.

The violence that ensued left thousands of civilians dead and displaced hundreds of thousands of others. Mosques, shops and homes were looted and destroyed.

The ICC’s presiding Judge Bertram Schmitt read harrowing details in The Hague of the violence committed by the militia against suspected Seleka Muslims.

Yekatom’s men tortured one suspect by cutting off his fingers, toes, and one ear. This man’s body was never found. Others were killed and then mutilated.

Appearing in court dressed in a light brown suit and waistcoat, white shirt, and dark tie, Yekatom listened impassively as the judge read out the verdict.

Dressed in a bright blue jacket, Ngaissona nodded to the judge as his sentence was delivered.

The court found Yekatom not guilty of conscripting child soldiers and acquitted Ngaissona of the charge of rape.

Both men had pleaded not guilty to all charges laid out in the trial, which opened in 2021. It is the first case at the ICC, which began in May 2014, to focus on the violence that erupted after the Seleka seized power in the CAR in 2013.

Yekatom was extradited to The Hague in late 2018, after being arrested in the CAR for firing his gun in parliament. Ngaissona was arrested in France in December 2018 and extradited to The Hague.

The trial of an alleged Seleka commander, Mahamat Said Abdel Kani, is ongoing.

Last year, judges at the ICC unsealed another arrest warrant in the investigation. According to prosecutors, Edmond Beina commanded a group of about 100-400 anti-balaka fighters responsible for murdering Muslims in early 2014.

Separate proceedings against Beina and five others at a specially-created court are slated to begin in the CAR on Friday.

The CAR is among the poorest nations in the world and has endured a succession of civil wars and authoritarian governments since gaining independence from France in 1960.

Violence has subsided in recent years, but fighting occasionally erupts in remote regions between rebels and the national army, which is backed by Russian mercenaries and Rwandan troops."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/breaking-down-ending-netflix-k-211345364.html,2025-07-25 22:30:00,Breaking Down the Ending of Netflix K-Drama 'Trigger',"IfTriggerwere a U.S. production, the action thriller that follows a police force as they deal with an influx of guns into their city wouldn’t have a very novel premise. In the U.S., where gun violencewas declared a public health crisislast year, there aremore guns than there are people, with an estimated 120.5 guns per every 100 people.

But in South Korea, whereTriggeris set, there are only 0.2 guns per every 100 people. Korean gun control laws are strict, and the weapons are practically a non-issue when it comes to public safety. While gun violence does occur, as was the case last week when afather shot his adult sonusing a homemade gun, it is a rarity in Korea, where private gun ownership is uncommon.

According toa 2022 article in the Korea Herald, private guns are intended for shooting athletes, manufacturers and sellers of firearms, and for those who need them for construction or as props in film or TV production. Licensed hunters may apply for gun ownership, but they must go through a rigorous qualification process and are only allowed to keep their guns at home during hunting season. Other times of the year, the firearms must be stored at the local police department. Otherwise, only authorized personnel in security-related fields can be in possession of firearms, and often, police officers choose not to carry them.

Trigger, a Netflix K-drama from writer-director Kwon Oh-seung (Midnight), imagines what would happen if all of these regulations were ignored, and unregistered, highly deadly firearms started streaming mysteriously and rapidly into the country.

Across 10 anxiety-inducing episodes, we follow police protagonist Lee Do (Island’s Kim Nam-gil) as he tries to keep Korean society from falling into a panic-induced frenzy, and succumbing to a status quo where gun violence is the norm. The thriller is simultaneously a parable for Korean viewers and a mirror for American viewers, who already live in a society where buying a gun can take as fewas five clicks.

The guns inTriggerare being funneled into the country by the fictional International Rifle Union (IRU), a black market arms dealer with immense political and economic power globally. The person behind the plan is Moon Baek (Evilive’s Kim Young-kwang).

Baek stumbles upon the IRU when as a kid, looking for revenge after being trafficked from Korea to the United States for his organs. Jake, one of the organization’s higher-ups, sees something valuable in the desperate, vengeful kid. He raises Baek to be a part of the organization.

The IRU’s entrance into Korea is facilitated by Baek, who has been diagnosed with six months to live due to cancer. While Baek presumably presents the plan to Jake as a business opportunity, he is really looking for retribution against the country that failed him. Upon his arrival in Korea, Baek murders the man who made his childhood a living hell. He hides bullets in the ceiling of the man’s apartment, a signal to officials that everything in Korea is about to change.

Baek uses some local gangsters, posing as regular mail couriers, to distribute the guns. He targets individuals who are marginalized for some reason or another. Many of them are physically and mentally bullied by the people in their lives. “Everyone carries a trigger in their heart,” a psychologist says early in the show’s run.Triggerimplies that everyone is capable of violence, and it is the job of a functional society not to give its citizens access to a weapon that can so easily lead to violent self-destruction.

Lee Do serves as a counterpoint to Baek’s nihilistic ruthlessness. While Do’s childhood may not have been quite as horrific, he didn’t have it easy. His parents and brother were killed during a home robbery when he was just a child. Immediately following the incident, Do takes a gun off of

Captain Jo’s (Kim Won-hae) desk and aims it at the man who killed his family, intending to pull the trigger. The captain talks him out of it, but the moment is a formative one for Do.

Jo raises Do as his own, alongside his daughter. Decades later, Lee Do is the Platonic ideal of a policeman, protecting the vulnerable and preferring de-escalation to violence. Until guns start appearing amongst the civilian population, Do chooses not to use a gun himself, still haunted by the lives he took during his years as a soldier. When gun violence starts ramping up, he decides to pick up a gun once again—but only when it is necessary to take someone down.

WhileTriggerhas a complex cast of characters, Lee Do and Moon Baek are the protagonist and antagonist at its center. Both suffered tragedy as children. One was given the support they needed to become a happy, healthy adult. The other was not, and has grown into a ruthless killer as a result. While Lee Do wants to protect the innocent (and even the guilty) around him, Moon Baek wants to see people suffer like he has. Gun violence is his method.

When Lee Do starts getting in Moon Baek’s way, the criminal mastermind becomes intrigued by the stalwart cop. To get closer to him, he poses as just another recipient of one of the illegal weapons, and offers his “help” in trying to stop various shootings. Do almost immediately identifies Baek as one of the people behind the organized influx of guns. However, when the police go to arrest Baek, he uses his immense resources to slip between their fingers and continue to wreak havoc.

Captain Jo, Do’s surrogate dad, becomes one of Baek’s desperate targets when ajeonsefrauddrives his daughter to suicide. Jo finds the men who scammed his daughter, confronting them at a karaoke room. When they show no remorse, he starts firing. Lee Do arrives on the scene once Captain Jo has followed one of the men outside. He convinces Jo to put the gun down, asking him not to let the feeling that killing the man will help fool him in this moment. “How did you bear this pain at such a young age?” Jo asks Do. “It was all thanks to you, Captain,” Do tells him, embracing his distraught father figure.

Baek, who has orchestrated the entire scenario to drive up public anxiety around shootings and to break Do’s resolve, doesn’t like how the scenario ends. He comes out of the shadows to shoot both Captain Jo and Lee Do. “Just wait and see,” Baek tells Do as he loses consciousness. “You'll wake up to a whole new world.”

As intended by Baek, Do is out of the action for at least a few days following the incident. When he wakes back up, he is devastated to learn that Captain Jo has died. He grieves Jo and her daughter, acting as the chief mourner at their funeral.

Meanwhile, Baek has announced to the public that anyone who wants a gun in Korea can get one. Public fear is at an all-time high as thousands of weapons are delivered to the populace, and incidents of gun violence become more common as a result. On the news, political pundits begin to debate whether gun ownership should be legalized in Korea. The president is considering martial law.

A “Free Guns” rally is organized by Baek to pit the two sides of the argument against one another. Lee Do leaves the funeral in order to attend. Baek has a truck filled with boxes of weapons driven into the middle of the rally. Chaos breaks out as people frantically grab the weapons, thinking they need them to protect themselves. Baek sets off smoke bombs to further confuse the crowd.

As Lee Do makes his way to Baek, he remembers a philosophical argument they had over dinner, before Do realized Baek’s villainy. “Wouldn’t pulling a 5-milimeter trigger in pursuit of revenge spread fear in the minds of many?” Do told Baek. “Out of fear that they might die without a gun, everyone will rush to get one. And a society like that will soon be destroyed.” Baek wants to create that society, and he is well on his way. “It was this world that made the people angry,” he tells Do, making the bad faith argument. “All I did was hand them a gun. It’s up to them whether they pull the trigger.”

In the smoky plaza, as scared people point guns at one another, Baek taunts Do. “What I want is a single gun shot …  that will make these people start shooting at each other” He wants Lee Do to be the one to pull the trigger. Baek disappears into the smoke and Do follows, gun drawn. Before he can find the man, a gun shot rings out. Baek has been shot, perhaps by his own hand. The plaza erupts into gunfire.

In the chaos, Do sees a boy alone, crying for his mother, a gun in his hands. It is an echo of the boy he once was. Rather than defend himself, Do drops his gun and rushes to him. He embraces the child as the gunfire continues. “It’s okay. You’re safe,” he tells him. The image is captured by a livestreamer on the scene. It stops nurse So-hyeon, whom we have been following throughout the series, from using a gun to kill the co-workers who bully her.

Once the dust has settled, and scores of people are dead, the image of Lee Do embracing the scared child becomes a symbol of choosing empathy over violence. Later, we see the image at a memorial for the victims of the shooting. Another message at the memorial states: “We will remember the innocent lives lost and work to create a safer world.”

Baek is in a coma following the events of the firefight. The doctor tells Do, who visits Baek in the hospital, that he is unlikely to recover, due to his cancer and the blood loss sustained from the gunshot wound. Later, we see an English-speaking cabal of IRU members, including Jake, vaguely discussing their next business move. A woman walks into the wards where Baek is unconscious, presumably to kill him.

The ending ofTriggerisn’t happy, but it is hopeful. Across the country, the police hold illegal firearm drop-off drives to collect as many of the weapons as possible. One of the people who drops off a fun is nurse So-hyeon. ""It took too long,"" she tells Officer Jang, who collects her signature. ""You did the right thing,” he tells her.

Lee Do survives to de-escalate another day. In an echo of what Captain Jo did for him, Do adopts the child he saved in the firefight. He picks the boy up from school, and holds his hand as he walks him home. Do is doing what he can.

Scientists say melting glaciers might do more than raise sea levels — they could also stir sleeping giants beneath the Earth's surface, according toInside Climate News.

At a recent science conference in Prague, researchers presented findings showing that shrinking glaciers can trigger volcanic eruptions. A team supported by the National Science Foundation analyzed six volcanoes in the Chilean Andes and found that, thousands of years ago, volcanoes became more active as the last ice age ended. The reason? Less weight holding down the magma.

""When you take the load off, it's just like opening a Coca-Cola bottle or a champagne bottle,"" said Brad Singer, a geologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, per ICN.

This shift doesn't just apply to the Andes — scientists warn that as ice sheets continue to retreat in places like Alaska, Iceland, and Antarctica, once-quiet volcanoes could come roaring back to life.

Volcanic eruptions aren't just dramatic — they can be dangerous and far-reaching. Ash can ground planes, contaminate water, and choke crops. If one erupts during another extreme event — such as a heat wave, wildfire, or severe storm — it could overwhelm already strained systems.

That's not all that melting ice is changing. Higher tides are worsening flooding during storms, and shifting temperatures are expanding the range of mosquitoes that spread disease. While extreme weather events aren't new, scientists have found that human activity is making many of them more intense — almost like putting extreme weather on steroids.

Scientists are working on better ways to monitor volcanoes and spot warning signs earlier, but preparation doesn't stop with research.

Cities are making changes on the ground — from planting more trees to cool neighborhoods, to updating infrastructure and emergency plans. And plenty of groups are stepping up in creative ways.Re:wildis protecting wild spaces that absorb carbon, and Trashie is helping people recycle everything from old sneakers to worn-out clothes instead of sending them to landfills.

This is especially true when the bears become curious or playful, such as the young grizzly in the accompanying footage.

The footage, featured this week by ViralHog, shows the bear picking up one of two traffic cones marking a sink hole and dropping the cone into the hole. (Click here if video player does not appear below.)

The cone vanishes and the bear looks as though it had just lost its favorite toy, as laughter erupts among the tour group.

As the bear’s head disappears into the hole, one tourist remarks, “Oh, he’s gonna go in for it. Oh my god!”

The outcome is unclear but it appears as though the bear did not retrieve its toy, and the sink hole was left marked with only one cone.

An estimated 300 to 350 grizzly bears inhabit the north side of the Alaska Range within Denali National Park and Preserve. Sightings are not guaranteed, but bears are often spotted from or even on the park’s main road.

One sunny morning in May, four high school students stood on a flower-dappled prairie in southern Dallas holding shovels. Before them swayed a Texas blazing star, a tall and spindly stalk that erupts in a bottlebrush of purple florets. Max Yan, a senior, made two putts on either side of the imperiled member of the aster family and was beginning to wedge it out when a siren wailed in the distance. He froze, his foot on the blade. There were no fences, no signs warning them off. But the land is, like 97% of the state, private property, and they were, strictly speaking, breaking the law.

“Hopefully that’s not for us,” he said.

The siren faded, and the teens — who attend St. Mark’s School of Texas, an elite, all-boys prep academy on the other side of town — resumed work. They are among the most dedicated members of its prairie club, rising early on weekends to rescue rare plants from bulldozers and move them to restoration sites. Their guerrilla campaign rattles some professional conservationists, but in an era of mounting climate anxiety, it offers a tangible way to make a difference. Not to mention a dose of adrenaline. It is, one said, like “collecting my Pokémons.”

Coneflower Crest, as the boys call this place, after the dusty pink flowers that bloom here, covers nearly 300 acres of undeveloped land believed by some to be the last large intact prairie in Dallas County. Heavy machinery is expected to crush most of it, making way for hundreds of homes and businesses promised to revitalize a neglected corner of Dallas. The developers tout their project’s walkability and eco-friendliness, with ample open space, water-smart landscaping, and native vegetation. But even the greenest projects come at a cost: The city is trading an ecosystem that naturally mitigates the effects of climate change for still more impervious growth that only exacerbates them.

The trend is accelerating across Texas, where blackland prairie once stretched roughly 12 million acres from the Red River to San Antonio — an area nearly twice the size of Vermont. Eons ago, an ancient inland sea sculpted the state’s limestone geology and enriched its soil, sustaining more than 300 species of indigenous grasses and herbaceous flowering plants like big bluestem, lotus milkvetch, and rattlesnake master that fed bison and pronghorn antelopes.

But since European colonization, agriculture and urban development have swallowed 99.9% of the prairie and continue taking their fill. No more than 5,000 acres are left statewide, and last year, a solar farm claimed most of the largest remnant near the Oklahoma border. In Dallas County, which covers some 908 square miles, more than 300 acres have been scraped away since 2014 to make way for everything from data centers and parking lots to high-rises and warehouses — and even agolf course.

All that concrete increasesfloodingand emissions, depletesaquifers, and compounds theurban heat island effect— the same problems prairies naturally alleviate, said Norma Fowler, a plant ecologist at the University of Texas at Austin. Long grasses and herbs help the ground soak up rain. Their roots reach a depth of 16 feet, producing humus-rich soil that holds water and releases it slowly. Prairies also cool cities, temper the impact of wildfires, and sequester up to one ton of carbon per acre each year. It’s why biodiversity loss and climate change are inherently linked. “Everything we do for conservation is also mitigating the bad effects of climate change,” Fowler said. “If we want to save the planet, it’s not either-or. It’s both-and.”

Environmentalists have rallied to save the region’s grassland since at least the 1980s, when one particularly impassioned fellow patrolled Pioneer Prairie — a 127-acre field off Interstate 30 — with a shotgun. By the 1980s, development of the site loomed, prompting naturalist Ken Steigman to start surreptitiously digging up plants. He even used a sod cutter to roll up ribbons of earth — bugs and all. “It’s like Noah’s ark,” he said. “You are trying to protect everything.”

Plans to replace the prairie with condos stalled amid an FBI investigation of its developers, who were later convicted of loan fraud. Activists rejoiced. Still, development came in bits and pieces, including the construction of a medical complex and a church. In 2019, a native nursery owner named Randy Johnson saw a drilling rig pulling cores for geotechnical analysis, a harbinger of construction. He rode his Honda minibike through its Indian grass as a kid, but by his 20s, reckless joy had given way to wonderment. Johnson worked with the city manager to map its most ecologically sensitive areas, thinking the landowner might build around them, but the bulldozers spared nothing. “It’s one of the most depressing things,” he said with a drawl. “[It’s] something you love and have devoted your life to, and every day you get in your car and see it being destroyed.”

He had nearly given up hope when a lanky freshman named Akash Munshi wandered into the St. Mark’s greenhouse, which Johnson tended, that same year. The young man was “hyper,” Johnson said, and extremely bright. Inspired by relatives in south India who cultivate rice, Munshi wanted to learn how to grow food and started a horticulture club. That interest gave way to native plants, and within a couple years, Munshi was as fluent in their Latin names as their common ones.

His senior year, the club began restoring prairie to an acre of bermuda grass along a nearby bike path, a feat that consumed his time outside studies and soccer practice. To source the seeds, he visited local prairies, often after spotting their grassy texture and blinding limestone in satellite imagery. He counted six large sites fated for development, impressing on him a need to salvage as many plants as possible. Within two years, all but one — Coneflower Crest — were stripped bare.

“It was pretty crushing. I didn’t realize how quickly I would lose them,” he said. “There were some sites where there was no sign of development, and I’d come back [the] next week, and the whole thing was scraped.”

The destruction coincides with unprecedented biodiversity loss.Forty percentof all known plants worldwide, and45% of floweringones, could be at risk of extinction, and they are disappearing at arate many magnitudes higherthan normal due to human activity andclimate change. Those recently discovered — like glandular blazing star, first described in 2001 and found only in Texas — are even more likely to vanish without anyone understanding their role or what benefits they might offer. As populations of at-risk flora shrink, their gene pools become less diverse, making them vulnerable to collapse.

“Each one of those that’s lost is threatening an already under-pressure system,” said Canaan Sutton, a botanist at the National Ecological Observatory Network. The organization collects ecological data to support research on how ecosystems are changing in response to climate change and other factors. Animals of all kinds lose food and habitat when prairies fall, particularly invertebrates with unique relationships to plants they’ve evolved with. There are fewer caterpillars to feed the birds, for example, and fewer bees to pollinate blooms and crops like east Texas’ famed blueberries.

Rescuing doomed individuals can help prevent uncommon species from undergoing “a silent extinction,” Sutton said. Though conservationists focus on collecting seeds, they aren’t always ripe when developers permit harvesting. Some, like hall’s prairie clover, remain so poorly understood that few know how to germinate them. Others, including compass plants, take years to bloom from seed, delaying their availability to pollinators. Keeping a specimen alive helps bridge these gaps. But ultimately, the restoration sites where they live are faint echoes of the vast, complex ecosystem they once knew.

“What we're in now is this perpetually shifting baseline of, ‘This is what we have, and this is as good as it gets,’” Sutton said. “Ultimately, people doing these rescues are trying to move that baseline back in the direction of the past and a more interconnected, natural world — even if that's just [with] a handful of plants.”

* * *

The summer after his senior year, Munshi was leading a high school tour through another prairie destined to become a data center. Stopping for a sip of water, he noticed a tiny yellow flower, which he had previously only read about, standing out against a girl’s black shoe. “Oh shoot!” he said. “That’s Dalea hallii!”

Hall’s prairie clover — a globally imperiled plant listed as threatened by the state — grows on chalky, south-facing slopes of limestone prairies. These patches, an offshoot of the blackland prairie, form where bedrock breaks the surface, creating microhabitats that shelter species found nowhere else. They survived for centuries because the rocky terrain was too difficult to plow. But now, as developers search for more land to build on, that same rock offers an ideal foundation for sprawl.

At the time of Munshi’s discovery, just59 populationswere known to exist on Earth. He counted at least 100 plants andsharedhis find on Instagram and during a presentation at a meeting of the Native Prairies Association of Texas. It stunned Sutton — then president of the group’s Blackland chapter — and he worked with the Botanical Research Institute of Texas, or BRIT, which banks obscure seeds, to arrange a rescue operation that October.

The developer gave the crew three hours to dig up what it could. Wearing his customary conical straw hat, Johnson showed more than 40 volunteers how to excavate the plant’s 4-foot-long tap root using knives, pickaxes, sledgehammers, and pneumatic drills. Afterward, he hauled about 300 daleas to his nursery in Forney. Johnson, who is known locally as a plant wizard and, with his long gray hair and narrowed eyes, looks the part, repotted them insoilpacked with microbes from bat guano and other things. A month later, he texted Sutton a picture of a flourishing dalea ready for its new home. “He was like, ‘Check it out, dude!’” Sutton said.

To increase their odds of survival, the clover was spread across several sites, including a park, a preserve, and a ranch. More than one-third of those planted on public land survived, a high success rate for such delicate flora. But 180 minutes wasn’t sufficient to save the remaining plants dotting Penstemon Point. So, when Kay Hankins, a conservation botanist at BRIT, offered to contact the developer at Coneflower Crest, Munshi asked her not to, fearing they wouldn’t be given enough time. He and others have spent hundreds of hours relocating thousands of flowers from that site and others to a bike path 30 minutes north — casting any worries about trespassing aside like the rocks they pried loose with their shovels

Despite the questionable legality of their efforts, Munshi said no one has ever confronted them or even asked them to leave. Once, at another location, a passerby suspected him of burying a body and called the police. When the officers saw the plants, they left. “They don’t care,” Munshi said. “They’re literally about to scrape the entire site.”

Johnson fears seeking permission could backfire. A raft of federal protections shields endangered species. Texas offers few for those it lists on its own, and landowners who don’t want the hassle or liability of having them on their property may target them. “This is a war between us and the developers, and nobody’s calling uncle or throwing up white flags,” he said. “You can get out of jail, you can post bail, but once the [plant] genetics are gone, they’re gone, and I’m not going to let that happen if I can help it.”

But some in Texas’ native plant community are uneasy with this approach, arguing that permission is essential for “ethical” digs that promote trust and collaboration with landowners and developers. “If all the experience developers have [with conservationists] is negative, we’ll always be initiating the dialogue from a disadvantaged position,” Hankins said.

Developer involvement could ensure that activists don’t inadvertently disturb land that isn’t slated for construction, and more volunteers might help out if it doesn’t involve breaking the law. It also enhances the flora’s value for research and conservation, Hankins said, since reputable institutions, seed banks, and herbaria don’t accept specimens collected without paperwork. As Ashley Landry, who founded the Native Plant Rescue Project near Austin, put it, “We can’t give rare plants to conservation organizations if they’re stolen.”

Landry plays “a long PR game” to gain access. She monitors municipal websites and follows the news to spot new development, then sends emails and snail mail to start a conversation with landowners. She also drives by their property to try catching them in person. In February, her team of 30 volunteers relocated 900 square feet of MoKan, the30-acre“crown jewel”of Central Texas prairies. Tractors carved out 56 sections, each as thick as a mattress, and stitched them together like quilts at two nearby sites. If the transplants take, the method could be replicated elsewhere.

“I just always feel so thankful to have seen these places before they're gone,” said Landry. “It helps frame your understanding of what the landscape is supposed to look like.”

Relatively few people can enjoy that experience today — and even fewer are likely to know it in the future. In Dallas, swaths of historic prairie survive in parks, preserves, and the unwanted stretches along utility lines and railroads. Most are tucked away on private land, off-limits to trespassers. These slivers of the past are all that remain there of the grasslands that once waved across the state. The prep school boys now fighting to save what’s left were raised in neighborhoods garnished with greenery from other continents. Some say they grew up without the strong sense of place that environmentalist Wendell Berry has called essential for living in a locale without destroying it.

Like Landry, those who have truly seen Coneflower Crest — not just looked at it, but knelt in its grasses, attuned to its miniscule delights and dramas — have felt changed by the experience. Munshi, now a plant science major at Cornell University, vividly remembers the first time he glimpsed what became his favorite prairie. White rosinweed andCobea penstemonspeckled the grasses, and butterflies flitted amid more echinacea than he had ever seen, suggesting the ground had never been scarred by a plow. “This is, like, a 10!” he exclaimed, filming the scenery. “Imagine what else is in here!”

Leadership of the club he founded, the Blackland Prairie Restoration Crew, passed to Yan, who graduated this spring. He has since handed it off to two boys who joined him in digging up the Texas blazing star and a handful of other beleaguered species. Just two days after their surreptitious dig, a dozen men and women in business suits smiled for the cameras as they scooped shovelfuls of what might be the county’s last expanse or tallgrass. Homes may rise on the pockets that held the greatest biodiversity. Yan and his friends knew this was coming and they understand the need for more housing, but it still saddened them. He dreams of a movement that would push developers to preserve prairies, though such a movement may come too late. ""I just don’t know if the prairie will be able to recover at that point,"" he said. ""There are parts of Coneflower Crest that will never be recovered.""

Stacked against this tremendous loss, their efforts felt almost trivial. But long after the bulldozers at Coneflower Crest move on to the next job, hundreds of its priceless plants will persist, quivering in the breeze along the bike path. Before Yan and his classmates even transplanted the last of the flora they’d rescued, a few uprooted daleas bloomed in their buckets, rising from the soil toward the sun just as they have always done.

It's one of the more regular, larger geysers in the park. It's featured here in June 2025 (Photo by Jacob Frank of the National Park Service via Flickr).

On Monday morning, a 17-year-old male suffered what Yellowstone National Park officials say are “significant thermal burns” to his foot and ankle area in the vicinity ofLone Star Geysernear Old Faithful.

The man was hiking in the thermal area when his foot broke through the thin crust, and he suffered burns, according to a news release from the park. Emergency medical staff responded and transported the patient to a hospital for further treatment. This incident is under investigation.

It marks the first known “thermal injury” in the park in 2025. The last reported incident occurred inSeptember 2024.

Lone Star Geyser is one of the most famous and regularly erupting geysers in the park, according to the T. Scott Bryan’s “The Geysers of Yellowstone.” It erupts approximately every three hours.

It is also one of the most recognizable geysers because of its unique cone, which is more than 9 feet tall.

According to Bryan, the geyser becomes active every 60 to 90 minutes after an eruption, making splashing and gurgling sounds, followed usually by a minor eruption, a major eruption, then often a series of smaller eruptions, before becoming seemingly dormant and then repeating the cycle. The eruptions last about five minutes, and the geyser can spray water as high as 45 feet into the air. The eruption and steam can often be heard as far as a mile away.

Park officials remind visitors to stay safe around thermal areas, which include pools, mud pots, geysers and vents.

Those instructions include staying on boardwalks and trails. Staying on them is a protection for both visitors and the delicate thermal formations. Water in hot springs can cause severe or fatal burns, and scalding water underlies most of the thin, breakable crust around hot springs.

Always walk on boardwalks and designated trails. Keep children close and do not let them run on boardwalks.

Do not touch thermal features or runoff.

Swimming or soaking in hot springs is prohibited. More than 20 people have died from burns suffered after they entered or fell into Yellowstone’s hot springs.

Petsare prohibited in thermal areas.

Do not throw objects into hot springs or other hydrothermal features.

Toxic gases may accumulate to dangerous levels in some hydrothermal areas. If you begin to feel sick while exploring one of our geyser basins, leave the area immediately."

From Japan, China and the Philippines to Hawaii, the US West Coast and Latin American countries like Mexico and Ecuador, warnings and evacuation order were issued due to the threat of potentially life-threatening, meter-high waves.

Yet more than half a day after the quake rocked Russia's Far East, there were no reports of major damage. In most regions, tsunami warnings were downgraded or, like in Russia and Japan, lifted entirely.

The danger was not over, however. Chile was still calling for mainland coastal regions to be evacuated, while on Easter Island the coastal promenade in Hanga Roa was closed, though most residents live in higher, safer areas, according to Radio Cooperativa.

World's strongest earthquake in 14 years

The main quake, which hit at about 11:24 am local time on Wednesday (2324 GMT Tuesday), was recorded by the US Geological Survey (USGS) at magnitude 8.8 - the strongest globally since Japan's Fukushima disaster in March 2011, and one of the six most powerful earthquakes ever measured. Russian authorities reported a magnitude of 8.7.

According to the Russian Academy of Sciences, it was the strongest earthquake to hit Kamchatka since 1952. The epicentre was in the open sea, about 130 kilometres from the sparsely populated coastline.

Dozens of aftershocks were recorded, many above magnitude 5. The two strongest were measured at 6.9 and 6.3 by the USGS.

Minimal damage in Russia

No major flood waves were recorded on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the Russian Civil Defence Ministry said on Telegram. A beach was evacuated as a precaution, with around 60 people brought to safety.

Most buildings withstood the quake, though structural inspections are ongoing, it said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said no casualties had been reported and that alert systems functioned as intended.

In the regional capital of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, frightened residents fled outside barefoot, according to the Russian news agency TASS.

According to civil protection officials, parts of the port of Severo-Kurilsk and a fisheries company were flooded.

Japan evacuates Fukushima site

On Japan's Pacific coast, a wave measuring 1.3 metres was recorded in a port in Iwate Prefecture, with up to 80-centimetre waves in other coastal regions, local media reported.

Authorities had issued tsunami warnings for waves up to 3 metres high. Northern Japan lies geographically closest to the quake zone.

Later, the Japanese Meteorological Agency downgraded its regional alerts, although advisories were still in place.

More than 2 million people had been asked to evacuate earlier in the day.

Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant were evacuated due to the tsunami warning.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) confirmed to the Japan Times that all staff reached higher ground safely.

The facility was the site of a major nuclear disaster in March 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami triggered multiple reactor meltdowns.

Warnings for Hawaii, US West Coast

Initial tsunami waves reached Hawaii Tuesday evening, with a peak of 1.5 metres. The US downgraded its warning by early Wednesday and life on the archipelago had returned to normal.

Warnings were also issued along the US West Coast, Alaska, Canada’s British Columbia, and parts of Latin America.

In Asia, China lifted its alert for coastal Zhejiang and Shanghai, while Taiwan also called off its alert. The Philippines and Indonesia later withdrew warnings after only minor sea level changes were observed.

Volcano erupts in Russia's Far East

Hours after the earthquake rocked Kamchatka, the region's highest volcano began erupting.

Geophysicists from the Russian Academy of Sciences reported a strong glow visible at the summit of the 4,750-metre Klyuchevskoy volcano in the Russian Far East.

Lava was seen flowing down one flank of the mountain, and explosions were audible, the experts said.

Also known as Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the volcano is located roughly 400 kilometers north of the regional capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.

It is considered the highest active volcano in Eurasia and forms part of the Pacific Ring of Fire — a seismically volatile zone encircling the Pacific Ocean."

However, warnings were still in place for unusual or strong water currents in some coastal areas of Hawaii. Swimmers and boaters should exercise caution, local authorities said.

According to US broadcaster CNN, the highest tidal wave in Hawaii reached 1.5 metres. The tsunami warning there ended just before 9am local time (1900 GMT) on Wednesday

Tsunami warnings were also lifted in the western US states of Alaska, Washington and Oregon.

Warnings had also been issued along the US West Coast, Alaska, Canada's British Columbia, and parts of Latin America.

In Asia, China lifted its alert for coastal Zhejiang and Shanghai, while Taiwan also called off its alert. The Philippines and Indonesia later withdrew warnings after only minor sea level changes were observed.

""At 11:24am local time, a magnitude 8.8 earthquake occurred near the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia,""wrote the U.S. Geological Survey.""Tsunami alerts were issued around the Pacific Basin. It followed a magnitude 7.4 foreshock on July 20 and is near the epicenter of the 1952 magnitude 9.0 event.""

Not long after the 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck Russia, the Klyuchevskoy volcano on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula began erupting. One of the most active volcanoes in Eurasia, it wasn't a complete surprise that the Klyuchevskoy volcano erupted following the earthquake.

However, less than a week later another major volcano in the area spewed debris in a rare eruption not seen for over 600 years. ""This is the first historically confirmed eruption of Krasheninnikov Volcano in 600 years,"" Russian state news agency RIA cited Olga Girina, head of the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team, as saying, viaSkyNews.

The Kronotsky Nature Reserveissued a statementrevealing the volcano sent ash four miles into the sky. Staff members have been evacuated from the area, the statement said, adding that the volcano was too far from towns in the region to pose a danger to people, via theNew York Times.

The eruption began at 6 a.m. local time on Sunday, when staff from the nature reserve on a research trip at the volcano spotted gas and vapor spewing from its crater before staff members were evacuated from the area.

No towns or villages are reportedly in reach of the ash plume following the eruption.

Hollywood. Public schools. The ruins of Pacific Palisades. What goes on inside at City Hall and the Hall of Administration.

But why go to those obvious choices when trying to figure out which way L.A. is going when the best answer is right in front of Platinum Showgirls LA?

I parked next to the downtown gentleman’s club on a recent weekday morning to do just that. A hulking security guard stood outside the entrance, the 101 Freeway buzzing nearby. So were the street vendors setting up for another day of business, damn themigraagents driving in and out of the Metropolitan Detention Center just up Commercial Street.

But I wasn't there for the sights or sounds — or what was going on inside Platinum Showgirls. I was there to scour the sidewalk for a plaque dedicated to a tree.

For centuries, a six-story-tall sycamore stood near this slice of land and saw empires come and go. Indigenous people from across Southern California and beyond gathered under its shade for special councils and to meet with its caretakers, the residents of the village of Yaanga. It was an awe-inspiring sight for the pobladores who came from Mexico in 1789 and set up El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles in the name of the Spanish crown. The sycamore — now bearing the nameEl Aliso— appears as a towering black splotch in the first known photo of Los Angeles, shot in the early 1860s when the city was in the process of turning from a Mexican village into an American town.

When El Aliso was finally chopped down in 1895, felled by brewery owners who inadvertently killed the giant after cutting off too many limbs and paving over its roots,residents took chips from itas a memento mori of sorts.

But El Aliso never truly died.

It lived on in the history books but especially in the memory of the descendants of the people who had seen the sycamore grow from a seed to a giant. In 2019,members of the Kizh-Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians were presentas representatives from the city of Los Angeles laid a bronze plaque on the sidewalk at the northeast corner of Commercial and Vignes streets — in the shadow of what was then a different strip club — to commemorate El Aliso.

“While its physical presence is gone,” the plaque stated, “the oral history handed down through the generations has kept its beauty and story alive in the Kizh people.”

I was looking to read those words for myself, to touch them and the etching of El Aliso that hovered above the dedication. To take inspiration from this fundamental part of L.A.’s past in hopes of divining its future. But when I finally figured out where the plaque was supposed to be, I found a shallow slot strewn with trash and the remnants of the adhesive that once kept the plaque in its place.

Leave it to 2025 for thieves to make off with a memorial to L.A.’s mother tree.

The fires. The raids. Housing inequality. Homelessness. Cost of living.Trump’s never-ending war against L.A. anything. Is the Big One around the corner? Probably.

Nothing seems to be going right in Lost Angeles right now. Trump says it. Too many residents feel it. Toomany former Angelenos scream it.

How can one possibly eventhinkabout a better future when the present is so bad? How can one even think aboutanyfuture when the current outlook seems so bleak?

But as I walked back to my car, an answer occurred to me that I wasn't expecting to be so hopeful.

Before I joined The Times in 2019, I never had any real interest or investment in L.A.

Oh, I visited family and friends and paid some attention to the political scene from my native Anaheim. Went to UCLA for graduate school, haunted the Sunset Strip and Thai Town for rock en español shows in my cub reporter days. But L.A. was just … L.A. Huge. Cool. Really diverse.

But special? No more so than any other great world city.

I never felt the metropolis up the 5 to be a den of grossness like too many of my fellow Orange Countians still think it is. It also never called to me as a promised land like it did to my creative O.C. friends, either. I generally rooted for L.A., but its future meant nothing to me.

My opinion obviously changed as I began to cover it as a columniststarting in 2020and tried to commit the layout and vibe of the city to my mind. One of the first things that struck me in a way I never anticipated was how precarious everyone felt their lives to be.

Oh, I had read enoughJoan Didion,Mike Davis, Nathaneal West and other writers to not be too surprised by this. But seeing it manifested was something else, and it made a lot of things about the city finally click.

From the Westside to the Eastside, from Wilmington through South L.A. and all the way to the San Fernando Valley, I met person after person who acted and lived as if what they had scraped for themselves was at risk of disappearing in an instant, in the most disastrous fashion imaginable. I initially thought this betrayed an insecurity in the Angeleno soul, but then I realized it was something worse.

If anyone's L.A. dream could crumble at any moment, that meant you had to defend it at any cost — and especially at the expense of everyone else.

The more I talked to people and studied L.A. history, the more this outsider felt that the idea of fighting for the dream was what created a famously segregated city that too often erupts, whether electorally or otherwise.

In an era where stratification is worse than ever and the federal government has declared war on various fronts — legal, psychological, financial — the L.A. of the past can’t be the guiding light for the L.A. of the future.

The city might have grown and operated as 19 suburbs in search of a metropolis —as Aldous Huxley infamously wrote— through most of the 20th century, but it’s time to act like a united front if we’re going to successfully navigate the rest of the 21st. And the rallying cry should be what we’re going through right now, what L.A. has weathered again and again:

Disaster.

Because when the going gets tough for L.A., the city rallies like only it can. Americans should see this resilience and the subsequent spur of creativity and hope as a blueprint on how to fight back and not just survive, but thrive better than ever.

Nothing has proved this more than our current year, with two catastrophes that would have buckled, if not outright destroyed, other cities.

ThePalisades and Eaton firesin January were infernos of biblical dimensions. People died, houses were incinerated, neighborhoods were eradicated. The suffering will continue for years, if not decades. Residents know their past can never be recaptured — and yet they continue to rebuild for whatever's next.

Angelenos could’ve stayed to themselves in the aftermath, but they chose not to. Theychoosenot to. The rest of L.A. has stood up to help survivors through financial donations and clothing and food drives and benefits that continue and whatever folks in the Palisades and Altadena need. At one of the city's darkest hours, Los Angeles shone brighter than ever.

I write thiscolumnaduring along deportation summerunleashed on L.A. and beyond bya native son of Santa Monicain what amounts to a racist revanchist snit. Even a generation ago, large swaths of L.A. would have been cheering on the raids. But today’s L.A. isn’t having it.

Read more:Arellano: Trump wants L.A. to set itself on fire. Let's rebel smarter

As with the fires, fundraisers and mutual aid societies andneighborhood watch groupshave sprouted. The city, from Mayor Karen Bass to street vendors, knows that it’s up against an Orwellian apparatus that wants us to collapse — and that L.A. will win.

Because L.A. always wins. We might not know how the victory will look, but we know it’ll happen.

See how I use “we”? Because while I plan to forever live in Orange County, I want to be a part of this future L.A. — an area, a people that teaches the rest of the United States how we’ll triumph as calamities of all types seem to crash down on this country with increasing regularity.

All of the stories and columns in this package are about that, from housing to fires, disasters to palm trees, transportation to climate change and beyond. No one thinks it’s going to be easy — if anything, it’s probably going to be harder than ever.

But everyone expects victory. The miracle of L.A. has gone too far for it to fail.

Which takes me back to El Aliso.

I haven’t read anything about the theft of its plaque, so I’m not sure when it happened. But people will read this and be upset. People will do something to mark El Aliso’s existence in front of a gentleman’s club near the 101 Freeway once more.

That means El Aliso will continue to live — maybe as a plaque, maybe as a hologram, maybe as something even grander. It can't die, because that means we will. It must live, because that means so will the rest of us.

L.A. is frequently seen as a place of destruction, where the past is bulldozed and forgotten and then trivialized and romanticized. But the Native American tribes that the Spaniards tried to eradicate are still here. The Latinos that Manifest Destiny tried to vanquish are now nearly half of the population of this most American of cities.

L.A. will survive whatever happens next. We will figure it out. We always do. There’s no other way. There’s no other option.

The Mount Pleasant Police Department in South Carolina has shared dashcam footage of a huge lightning strike, which caused a power outage and traffic delays

The footage shared on X showed the moment the bolt hit the ground, setting off a fiery explosion

""Fortunately, no one was injured,"" police noted when they shared the footage

A huge lightning strike caused a power outage in South Carolina — and it was all caught on camera.

The Mount Pleasant Police Department (MPPD) shared adashcam videoon X showing the moment when the lightning bolt hit the ground and set off a fiery explosion before taking down the power grid near the town of Mount Pleasant, S.C.

In the short clip — taken by an MPPD officer’s dashcam — the officer could be seen driving their car in torrential rains, when suddenly a lightning strike hits a transformer on the far left side of the video. The transformer erupts in a fire for a moment and nearby electricity poles could also be seen sparking on the right side of the camera.

After the lightning strike, nearby traffic lights could be seen going out immediately as nearby cars scrambled to figure out what to do next on the roadway. Several cars slowed down at the nearby intersection as they tried to proceed with caution.

The MPPDnoted on Xthat the incident happened at around 11 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 11 on Hwy 17 at the intersection of Shelmore Blvd., and brought “down wires across the roadway.”

“A bit too much excitement for a Monday!,” MPPD captioned the video. “The lightning strike caused our power outages and traffic delays. Fortunately, no one was injured, and@DominionEnergyresponded quickly, restoring power and removing the downed wires,” police added.

MPPD said that “more than a dozen Officers and CSOs” helped to manage the traffic at seven intersections where the traffic lights went out for “roughly three hours,” as the electricity company worked to remove the hazards from the road.

In the meantime, policesent out an alertfor cars to “avoid” the area, and noted that traffic was being redirected to a different location. MPPD announced on X that it had shut down a section of Hwy 17 just before 12:30 p.m. andreopened itat around 2:18 p.m.

Several people said they couldn’t believe that this was captured on camera in response to the video, with one person on X writing, “shocking, positively shocking.” Another said, “Wow! Bet that made a heck of a racket.”

The torrential rains were part of storms that hit the area and left flooding in larger cities including Charleston, which closed down several streets due to flooding, perWCSC-TV.

Research shows the Pacific hemisphere is losing heat faster than the African hemisphere.

The heat is from Earth’s molten interior, which causes continental drift.

Landmass traps more heat than seafloor surface, indicating a hotter Pacific of the past.

Scientists from the University of Oslo say one side of Earth’s interioris losing heat much fasterthan the other side—and the culprit is practically as old as time.

A study published inGeophysical Research Lettersusescomputermodels of the last 400 million years to calculate how “insulated” each hemisphere was by continental mass, which is a key quality that holds heat inside instead of releasing it. The pattern goes all the way back to Pangaea.

Earth has a red hot liquid interior that warms the entire planet from inside. It spins, too, generating both gravity andEarth’s magnetic field. This holds our protective atmosphere close toEarth’s surface.

Over the extremely long term, this interior will continue to cool until Earth is more likeMars. The surprise in the study is how unevenly the heat is dissipating, but the reason makes intuitive sense: Parts of Earth have been insulated by more landmass, creating something of a Thermos layer that traps heat.

This contrasts with how Earth loses most of its heat: “Earth’s thermal evolution is largely controlled by the rate of heat loss through the oceanic lithosphere,” the study authors write. Why is this the site of the greatest loss? For that, we need a quick-and-dirty run-through of continental drift.

Earth’s mantle is like a convection oven that powers a treadmill. Every day, seafloor surface moves a tiny bit; new seafloor is born from the magma that erupts at the continental divide, while old seafloor is smashed and melted beneath existing continental landmass.

To study how Earth’s interior heat behaves, the scientists built a model that divides Earth into African and Pacific hemispheres, then divides Earth’s entire surface into a grid by half degrees latitude and longitude.

The scientists combined several previous models for things like seafloor age and continental positions during the last 400 million years. Then, the team crunched the numbers for how muchheateach grid cell contains over its long life. This paved the way to calculate the rate of cooling overall, where the researchers found the Pacific side has cooled much faster.

The seafloor is far thinner than the bulky landmass, and temperature from within Earth is “quenched” by the enormous volume of cold water that’s above it. Think of the gigantic Pacific Ocean compared with the opposite-side landmasses of Africa, Europe, and Asia—it makes sense that heat dissipates more quickly from the biggest seafloor in the world.

Previous research on this seafloor effect only went back 230 million years, meaning the new model, which goes back 400 million years, almost doubles the timeframe being studied.

There’s a surprising contradiction in the findings. The Pacific hemisphere has cooled about 50 Kelvin more than the African hemisphere, but the “consistently higher plate velocities of the Pacific hemisphere during the past 400 [million years]” suggest the Pacificwasmuch hotter at a certain moment in time.

Was it covered by landmass at some point in the far distant past, keeping more heat inside? There are other possible explanations, but either way, the Pacific’s high tectonic activity today points to a heat disparity. The meltier the mantle, the more the plates can slide and slam together.

Now, “Alien: Earth” jumps to the small screen with all the eerie essentials of the Ridley Scott sci-fi classic: dread-soaked atmospheres, spine-tingling suspense, and, of course, those horrifying acid-blooded freaks. But this time, the Emmy-winning creator carved out a bold new nightmare that exists in parallel rather than a continuation of the film franchise. For production designer Andy Nicholson, it meant diving headfirst into the archives to craft fresh, striking motifs that didn’t just nod to the past but expanded the iconic universe. The goal? To make it feel unmistakablyAlienwith a few surprises lurking in the shadows – all this while shooting in Thailand.

“Noah is a very experienced showrunner and has a great mind to kick ideas around with, which for someone like me is very refreshing,” Nicholson told IndieWire, who teamed with designer Jason Knox-Johnston to create the eight-episode haunt. His first question to Hawley was where, in the canon, visually and texturally, did the story take place? “What we both really liked was the vision of the future that the makers of ‘Alien’ had in 1979,” the production designer said. “That gave me a lot to play with because there were three principal jobs in this show. The Maginot, Prodigy City, and Neverland.”

Next Month on Hulu and Disney+, Original Shows and Movies Take Center Stage

For the story, chaos erupts after the USCSS Maginot, a Weyland-Yutani research ship, crash-lands in Prodigy City on Neverland, a research island founded by Prodigy Corp’s Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin). The two clash over the ship’s not-so-friendly cargo. Team Wey-Yu is led by a terminator-like cyborg, Morrow (Babou Ceesay), while Team Kavalier features a group of hybrids (synthetics with human consciousness) led by the insatiably curious Wendy (Sydney Chandler).

With Maginot, Nicholson took note of the Wey-Yu-owned USCSS Nostromo, which first appeared in the original film and then later in “Alien: Romulus” as wreckage. “That ship remains a benchmark as a spaceship interior, and I believe at the time, elevated the art form of production design in terms of what it brought to it,” he said. “Noah and I talked about what we really liked on the inside of Nostromo that would be good for Maginot.”

Nicholson studied the iconic ship frame by frame as few blueprints existed, working out set size and what details he should recreate and which to magnify. The result has Maginot boasting dark, industrial interiors and a peppering of futuristic flavor. Its utilitarian bridge hums with flickering monitors, exposed wires, and analog tech – tactile consoles fill the space. The most alluring: an escape room decked out with hundreds of small yellow lights and old-school monitors, a beacon of hope for those who can make it inside.

“There’s a lovely period of European car interior and furniture design from the late ‘70s and ‘80s, which you can feel in ‘Alien’ and a little bit less in ‘Aliens.’ We were inspired by that but expanded it to include Noah’s ideas about the future look,” Nicholson said. Maginot’s exterior took on a new shape, inspired by the USS Sulaco from “Alien” with engine details nodding to the Nostromo as Easter eggs for fans.

Creating the aftermath of Maginot’s wreckage in Prodigy City was another feat. “Because of the schedule, we had to build crashed versions of some of the interiors first. Usually, you don’t do this because it’s inefficient, but because we were shooting the scripts in episode order, we had to build damaged versions of the bridge, cyro chamber, and parts of a corridor,” Nicholson said.

It meant the team had to construct sets that could be easily swapped. For instance, the cryo chamber was designed with a collapsible ceiling. And one of the smashed corridors was made out of sections so it could be raised high in the air to mimic the same angle of the crashed aircraft. While most interior work, damaged or not, was constructed on soundstages, a sequence where Prodigy soldiers enter the ship through a hole in its hull was created on location.

“That scene was all practically shot in Bangkok,” Nicholson said. “We found an empty shopping mall completely derelict. In the middle of it was a five-story atrium, so we built a 40-foot by 30-foot section of the Maginot on an angle and the outside of the hull on the shopping mall. Then we bridged the gap with a twisted beam. So that whole first entry into the ship had very minimal set extension, only to give it a bit of depth for low and high shots.”

Prodigy City and Neverland was inspired by Thailand’s lush environment and architecture. “With an episodic, the audience needs to know on a very basic level exactly where they are when you jump from one scene to another. You need to know you’re in different parts of Neverland and that it’s different from the Maginot,” Nicholson explained. “So when I started to think about what Neverland should look like, the amount of concrete that was in Bangkok made it an interesting city. There’s some lovely brutalist architecture which is quite remarkable, thinking this could be a good look for some of Neverland.”

The main street of Prodigy City was found near their production offices, distinguishing itself by its abandoned stores and natural patina. Adding to the look was the work of graphic designer Neville Brody. “He did a lot of seminal pieces of the 1980s. It’s that lovely period in graphic design when everything was mainly letter set and wasn’t just done on a computer. I looked at his style and used that for a lot of the street signs and shop signs. It just felt like it worked for the location,” Nicholson said.

For Prodigy Corporation, Nicholson sought a building that had scale that didn’t rely on being a massive visual effects backdrop. “If you notice shots of Prodigy airships landing, there are elements that poke out from the jungle,” Nicholson said. “The idea of that is when you’re shooting on the ground, you can put a very recognizable silhouette in the background that lets you know we’re somewhere outside Neverland without having to see the big buildings.”

Interiors were designed to be multifunctional, while others, like the main lab, stood alone. Large air vents hinted at Prodigy Corp’s lax security, perfect for lurking aliens. Even Boy Cavalier’s sleek office wasn’t spared. “Not having rooms that were safe for anybody to be in helps amplify the threat,” Nicholson said. “So we made corridors you can never quite see around the corner, and all the windows are frosted so you don’t quite know what’s waiting on the other side.”

The lab holding the alien life hostage was designed with a muted color palette and tone. “We wanted the people and the creatures to stand out from the background,” Nicholson said. “There’s a fiberglass finish with vinyl flooring in the corridors, so nothing was popping too much.”

Opposite, Wey-Yu Corp makes only a brief appearance in the series. One such instance is a sequence involving a phone call that was shot at Bangkok’s Park Origin Thonglor Complex, which sustained substantial damage following a massive earthquake in March 2025. (Filming began in July 2023 with a touch over 120 shooting days, including areas of Phuket, Phang Nga, Surat Thani, Krabi, and the soundstage at The Studio Park in Samut Prakan.)

Transforming imagination into immersive nightmare fuel allowed the Thai set dressing team to flex their expertise. “They were able to bring back things that were so perfect that you wouldn’t be able to find in the UK or America. Stuff you need to recreate the things used to such great effect by Michael Seymour and Roger Christian on the original film,” Nicholson said. “We weren’t trying to copy what they were doing, but be inspired by that, and they should get credit for that.”The entire “Alien: Earth” production team should get credit, too, for expanding on Seymour’s and Christian’s work in the original, hopefully in a way that they — if not exactly Wey-Yu Corp — would approve.

“Alien: Earth” premieres August 12 on FX with new episodes weekly.

On Aug.18, it’s proudly screening two episodes of “Hidden Island” (“Isla Oculta”), a project that went through its Sanfic Series Lab and is one of the most highly anticipated series from Chile. The closed screening for invited guests is followed by one open to the public on Aug. 21.

Its trailer, viewed by tens of thousands on YouTube (60,000 and counting), has only fueled more interest in the sci-fi thriller series, which already picked up an award at Italy’s Global Series Festival last June.

Chile's Sanfic Opens With Cannes Palme d'Or Winner 'It Was Just an Accident,' Wraps With Lux Pascal Drama 'Miss Carbón'

Chilean Stars Alfredo Castro, Paulina García and Benjamín Vicuña Topline Horror Series 'The Unwelcome' at Sanfic Series LAB (EXCLUSIVE)

Descoloniza, Weltfilm Board Lucas Weglinski's 'The Night is a Farce' (EXCLUSIVE)

Curated by Argentina’s Agustina Lumi and Alejandra Marano since its inception six years ago, the Sanfic Series Lab has evolved into a vital program for many TV projects in their development trajectory.

Some 80 submissions responded to Sanfic Lab’s Open Call, making selection even more daunting. “In general, we review the selected projects, but we usually look at twice that number because we have agreements with various series-focused platforms around the world. So, we’re not only looking at projects that come through the open call, but also through other industry spaces related to series. Basically, we never stop—we spend the entire year watching series, all day long,” said Lumi.

Eight titles made the cut, some of which already came from other development programs where they won fast tracks to Sanfic Lab.

“Each of the projects has something unique to share, something that allows it to travel, to tell stories that may be local but resonate globally or in different markets. That’s what we were looking for: projects that have the potential to go international and that are truly unique, with a distinctive voice,” Lumi noted, adding that they also consider the track record of the producers and creators behind the projects.

“We closely follow talent—that’s very true. We pay a lot of attention to the teams behind the projects,” Marano concurred, citing International Emmy winner Hernán Caffiero (“The Suspended Mourning,” “Raza Brava”) who participates in the lab with the fact-based “The Craft of Thieves” (“El Internacional”) as well as writers/creators Luciana Porchietto and Mariana Levy participating with convent-based dramedy skein “Amen, Bárbara” whose “Menem,” is a recent buzz title on Prime Video. Both agree that the quality of the projects over the past six editions have only increased exponentially.

“Selecting series is more challenging when it’s not about exhibition but about development. You have to know when to choose a project, when to invite it or when to select it for a lab—making sure it’s at the right stage. The good thing is that, if timed well, you can really help the project instead of unintentionally holding it back,” Lumi mused.

The training and acceleration program focuses on the internationalization of projects and all the key elements involved in selling them—especially helping teams improve how they package and pitch their projects, better understand their audiences and analyze successful (or not so successful) cases of similar series.

Added Marano: “Each project receives individual one-on-one mentorship sessions. Then they participate in a masterclass on audiences, another on sustainability, focused on sustainable audiovisual production with an eco-vision. We also host keynotes with production companies that have already released projects on major platforms, so participants can engage in dialogues with them. It’s an opportunity for exchange—not necessarily direct advice, but definitely the sharing of experience.”

The 21st Sanfic runs over Aug 17-24.

A Drill Down on the Selected Projects:

“Amen, Bárbara” (“El Evangelio según Bárbara,” Luciana Porchietto and Mariana Levy, Argentina)

Created and written by Porchietto and Levy, writers of “Menem, the President Show,” now out on Prime Video. The story follows Bárbara, rebellious and broke, who fakes her way into a convent for a private room and some peace—only to find herself on an unexpected spiritual journey. “We believe this is a timely, highly adaptable project that could be shot in any Latin American or southern European city — places where two key elements intersect: a strong Catholic presence and a profound housing crisis.” The creators describe Bárbara’s loneliness as universal: “Like [Netflix’s] ‘Unorthodox’ — though in reverse — this is the story of a lost young woman navigating a unique, cloistered universe.” “’Amen, Bárbara’ speaks to a generation left out of the housing market, working gig jobs and craving real connection. As agnostics, we are also intrigued by the return of certain humanitarian values to Catholicism under Pope Francis — the idea of the Church as a place for the outcast. That contradiction felt like a story we had to tell.”

“The Unwelcome” (“Allegados,” Oscar Chamo Godoy, María José San Martín, Andrés Martínez-Ríos, Chile, Mexico)

In advanced development. Set in 1980s Chile, it follows a 16-year-old boy who finds solace from his troubled home life through writing and drawing a vampire story in his school notebook. Chile’s Alfredo Castro (“The Count”), Paulina Garcia(“Gloria”) and Benjamín Vicuña (“Envious”) have boarded the upcoming series while the search is still underway for someone to play the young teen. The 8-episode series is set to shoot in the second half of 2026. Recent deals include sound post-production with Yagán Films (Chile) and image post-production with Chemistry, México led by Andrés Martínez-Ríos who has been invited to direct a few episodes alongside Oscar Chamo Godoy and María José San Martín. Author-screenwriter Ernesto Garratt says he had always wanted to adapt his own books: “I aim to challenge the elitist perception of Chilean cinema by crafting more engaging and realistic narratives that incorporate magical realism and fantasy, thereby bridging the gap between cinema and audiences and shedding light on harsh social realities.”

“Architects From the Global South,” (“Arquitectas del Sur del Mundo,” Ana Cristina Barragán, Chile, Colombia)

The documentary series written by Maria Court explores the lives and visions of leading female architects across Latin America. Each episode, directed by a local filmmaker, delves into their creative processes and addresses themes such as gender, ecology and indigenous knowledge, revealing the continent’s cultural and architectural richness. Produced by Chile’s Clara Films, founded in 2018 by Clara Larraín, the only Chilean woman to win the Marché du Film’s Promising Producer Award. Series is co-produced with Productora LAP (Colombia). Confirmed architects include Cazú Zegers (Chile) and Ana María Durán (Ecuador). Filming begins in December 2026, with development support from Sanfic Lab and Max Belo Horizonte, which confirmed two TV windows. A recent investment agreement was signed with Cazú Arquitectos for the Chilean episode. Says Larrain: “Since I was a child, I have witnessed the work of my mother, Cazú Zegers, and her unique way of combining architecture, poetry and landscape, blazing a trail as a woman in a male-dominated field. Inspired by her journey and that of other Latin American architects, I want to document this generation that is breaking down gender and territorial barriers, designing spaces from an ecofeminist perspective that respects nature and champions local knowledge.”

“The Adventures of Picuy”(“Las Picuy Aventuras,” Nathaly Castillo, Colombia)

An animated children’s series produced by La Comarca Producciones, based in Pasto, southern Colombia and led by Danny Benavides, Paulo Cabrera and Nathaly Castillo, the story follows Senubia, a 5-year-old girl who, while visiting her grandmother and her friend Olmedo Picuy, discovers the magical powers of a ruana [a poncho-style cape] that transforms them into various plants, animals and objects. Currently in the production phase of its second episode, the project also includes 20 complementary audiovisual capsules aimed at broadening its narrative reach. These will soon be broadcast on Telepasto, a regional channel. La Comarca Producciones, founded in 2003, has a history of cultural work and is dedicated to promoting audiovisual projects that highlight real-life experiences and cultural identity. According to screenwriter Danny Benavides, “This project invites children into a world where rural life holds valuable knowledge, helping them imagine, learn and grow with purpose.” The series combines puppetry, animation and local landscapes to offer unique storytelling with cultural depth. “It’s a commitment to imagining from a place of sensitivity and collectivity,” says Castillo.

“The White Wolves” (“Los lobos blancos” Ángel Barroeta, Colombia, Venezuela, U.S.)

A visceral, high-stakes drama set in Petare, one of Latin America’s most dangerous slums. It follows Catire Blanco, a young mechanic who defies the barrio’s sacred rule of never fighting back, drawing his family into a violent conflict with ruthless gangs and corrupt cops. As the situation spirals out of control, the Blanco family must choose between survival and vengeance. The series is a collaboration between L.A.-based Beach House Films, led by Venezuelan actor-filmmaker Raul Walder, and Navaja Pictures, founded by the project’s creator, writer and producer Ángel Barroeta, based in Miami and Venezuela. Both companies are known for their bold, emotionally charged narratives. “This is the Latin America that’s fighting to be heard – raw, wounded and burning,” says Walder, creator and producer. Barroeta adds, “We’ve seen cartels and narcos, but never a story like this—told from inside the barrio, with real heart, vulnerability and cinematic ambition.” “The White Wolves”has already earned recognition at Filmarket Hub, Santa Barbara and ScreenCraft, positioning it as a powerful narrative about family, dignity and the cost of freedom.

“The Craft of Thieves” (“El Internacional,” Hernán Caffiero, Chile)

Based on actual events, drama about Ronald Zúñiga, a young man who defies his father and becomes an international thief. After his friend Laucha Quintanilla is arrested in Europe and blames Ronald, a violent conflict erupts between the Zúñiga family, involved in theft, and the Quintanilla family, entangled in drug trafficking. Ronald returns to Chile to defend his family’s honor and confront his enemies. The series is produced by DeCulto, a new Santiago-based company founded by Hernán Caffiero, with co-production from Tridi Films. “The ‘Craft of Thieves’ is a raw and human depiction of violence as a cycle,” says executive producer Paula Guzmán, “It explores the cost of success in marginalized contexts.” Project has already secured funding from the Chilean Ministry of Culture’s Audiovisual Promotion Fund. 40% of the series will be filmed in Spain, with shooting scheduled for the second half of 2026. “Through Ronald Zúñiga, we portray the dilemmas, loyalties and risks faced by young people in vulnerable environments,” says Caffiero.

“Tourette” (“Tourette,” Camilo Fonseca and Andrés Sánchez Belzunces,Colombia)

From La Guapa, an independent film and series production company based in Colombia and Spain, founded by Camilo Fonseca. The company specializes in developing high-concept, hard-hitting, provocative and boundary-pushing stories, it explains. Created by Fonseca and Andrés Sánchez Belzunces, “Tourette” follows Salva, who, after being fired from a major ad agency in Mexico for an offensive outburst, fakes Tourette’s Syndrome to regain his job. His plan backfires as he becomes a viral symbol of political correctness and his life spirals when he meets Lucía, a woman with OCD. The series is currently in development, with shooting dates and casting to be determined. It has already garnered recognition, winning the Sanfic Prize, BAM Prize and Peris Costumes Prize at Conecta Ficción 2025. “‘Tourette’ is a politically incorrect comedy about political correctness. It flips outrage culture on its head and dares to laugh at the lies we tell to fit in. Bold, uncomfortable and painfully timely,” says Fonseca.

“Useless Skills” (“Las Habilidades Inútiles,” Gabriel Dalla Torre and Lucia Bracelis, Argentina)

From El Generador, an audiovisual production company based in Mendoza, Argentina, with over 15 years of experience in both documentary and fiction, including series and feature films. The company focuses on telling inspiring stories and developing innovative ideas across film, TV, and multiplatform formats. Currently offers services in sound design, editing, color correction, co-Working spaces and production rental.

El Generador’s productions have earned national and international acclaim, winning awards at various festivals and funds and being distributed in the U.S., China, Portugal, U.K. and Greece. “Useless Skills” is an existential crime story that delves into the effects of prohibition, death and societal boundaries, exploring how opposites attract. The screenwriters, Gabriel Dalla Torre and Lucia Bracelis, along with producers Cecilia Agüero and Gisela Levin, aim to create a narrative that blends dark humor and tension. Although the director and cast have yet to be selected, the novel on which the series is based won the Best Novel Award from the City of Mendoza. “We champion works that challenge norms through complex characters and bold perspectives – values this series amplifies with its daring tone,” say Agüero and Levin.

But beneath the calm seas lurked a behemoth: Axial Seamount, a massive volcano 4,500 feet below the ocean’s surface. Kelley and her team are in the middle of a maintanence mission, working nearly 24 hours a day for weeks to recover and restore the instruments that keep tabs on the volcano, which scientists believe will erupt in 2025.

Kelley, director of the Regional Cabled Array, is not so sure.

USA TODAY reported on the volcano in May, and not much has changed since then, other than a slight decline in some of the prescursors to eruption. Researchers say they still don't know what it will take to trigger the next eruption or exactly when it will happen.

""We can only wait and see, but nothing seems imminent at the moment since the rate of unrest keeps wavering up and down, up and down,"" Bill Chadwick, a volcanologist with Oregon State University who’s part ofa team that’s studying the volcano, wrote ina July 30 blog post.

A reservoir has been refilling with magma since its last eruption in 2015, gradually inflating and causing the volcano to rise. Eventually, the pressure will become so great that it will open up and lava will pour out.

Kelley said there have been some indications that an eruption is coming, like submarine hydrothermal vents beginning to boil. The hot water is attracting sea life that prefer warm, nutrient-rich waters.

But ""not much"" has been happening with the volcano lately, Chadwick wrote.

The rate of inflation has been slowly decreasing all year. There was a brief spike in seismic activity - including one day in June with over 2,000 earthquakes - but that has dwindled to an average of 100 per day.

""All those indications from previously was that it would erupt, but those have all slowed down now,"" Kelley said.

When the volcano erupts, it will spew enormous amounts of lava into the ocean for days or even months.

Kelley said the lava flow could potentially cause tens of thousands of explosions and billions of microbes will stream out onto the sea floor like flakes from a snowblower.

But Axial Seamount is not a threat to humans. It won't trigger a tsunami or earthquakes on land, and even a person in a boat directly above it likely wouldn't notice, Chadwick previously said.

But it will provide researchers a virtually unprecedented opportunity to watch what happens when the lava flows.

""We're never there in the right place, in the right time to know that's happening,"" Kelley said. ""So this is a phenomenal opportunity to gain a lot of insights about major processes operating on our planet.""

Axial is the world’s most extensively studied undersea volcano because more than 660 miles of undersea cables crisscross it, sending a steady stream of real-time data about the area to scientists. TheRegional Cabled Arrayincludes more than 140 instruments that are constantly monitoring it.

The work is part of a larger ocean monitoring effort by theOcean Observatories Initiative, which maintains more than 900 ocean-based instruments to address critical questions about the world's oceans, funded by the National Science Foundation.

But that work may now be under threat. The National Science Foundation's budget for fiscal year 2026 proposed slashing the initiative's budget by 80% in its tenth year,the organization said in June.

Kelley said its not yet clear how the cuts will affect her projects, but she hopes to be back out on the waters above Axial next summer.

""We don't know how that what the cuts will be, what the budget will be, and how that funnels down to us yet,"" Kelley said. ""So we have hope. I always have hope, it's just in my nature to do so.""

This article originally appeared on USA TODAY:Axial Seamount expected to erupt. But scientists don't know when"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-petrodollar-not-gop-fiscal-150000575.html,2025-08-23 18:00:00,"Opinion - The petrodollar, not GOP fiscal restraint, is what sustains our unsustainable debt","For decades, the Republican Party has marketed itself as the nation’s fiscal conscience when it comes to curbing spending and safeguarding future generations from crushing debt. The branding is so effective that many Democrats tacitly concede the point, while Republican voters cling to the belief their partyholds the lineon excess.

A closer look reveals spending habits rivaling, or exceeding, Democrats’. Republican lawmakers campaign on slashing spending, only togreenlightmassive expenditures once in power.

Eventually, we must confront the Republican elephant in the room: Effective rhetoric is not the same as consistent governance. If Republicans are the party of limited government and tight budgets, why do their fiscal principles evaporate once they control the purse strings?

Across recent decades, federal spending has continued to climb under Republican control. This isn’t occasional — it’s apatternrepeated every election cycle.

Recently, the passage of the so-called “big beautiful bill” has drawn the scorn of Republican fiscal hardliners. Despite promises to cut spending and tighten the budget, this budget package increasedfundingacross key areas.

Republicans defend it with linguistic gamesmanship, calling the smaller-than-expected increase a “cut.” But a smaller increase is not a cut; it’s an increase. That episode isn’t an outlier; it’s part of a broader pattern. When Republicans boost spending, it’s usually wrapped in careful justifications.

Military buildups are sold as essential for national security. Tax cuts are pitched as engines of economic growth, even when paired with soaring deficits, andomnibusbills pass amid political noise, rarely drawing scrutiny.

Many arguments are defensible in context, but that’s different from pretending the spending doesn’t exist. Ultimately, Republican spending just becomes a reshuffling of priorities.

All of this combines to create a narrative where fiscal discipline appears to be the exclusive domain of Republicans, even as spending grows under their watch. It’s a classic case of “pay no attention to that man behind the curtain”.

This strategic outrage serves multiple purposes. It rallies the base, undermines Democratic credibility and shifts the focus away from Republican budgetary contradictions. The result is a toxic cycle of partisan blame that obscures the real problem: Washington’s collectivefailureto confront the nation’s fiscal challenges honestly.

Some argue the lack of urgency stems from a deeper reality: U.S. debt may not carry the same consequences as that of other nations. At the heart of this theory is thepetrodollarsystem.

Since the 1970s, global oil transactions have been priced and conducted almost exclusively in U.S. dollars. That arrangement has given America an unparalleled advantage, effectively creating an economic blackmail chip.

If a nation pushes too hard for debt repayment, we can limit dollar access, drive up energy costs, and disrupt its economy. In essence, our debt becomes a “phantom debt” — it is technically real, but we are functionally insulated from the typical consequences of indebtedness.

This doesn’t mean deficits are harmless, but it does offer an explanation for the mindset behind the modern spending culture in Washington. Why sacrifice political capital to make painful cuts when the global financial system is rigged to absorb your excess?

Of course, this illusion only works so long as the petrodollar remains dominant. Moves by BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to build analternativefinancial system bear watching.

This particular effort may or may not succeed, but even if it doesn’t, another challenge will come. Eventually, one of them might gain traction, and when that day arrives, America’s ability to treat debt as abstract or consequence-free could vanish overnight.

In public life, the gravest offense is often not the sin but the shattering of expectation. We are a society that can forgive nearly anything except hypocrisy. When someone builds a public image on righteousness, integrity or discipline, the most furious gnashing of teeth erupts when that facadecollapses.

Lance Armstrong, for example, wasn’t ruined just for doping, but forbetrayingthe image of the cancer survivor who conquered the impossible.

The Republican Party’s brand is similarly constructed. It alone has the courage and discipline to restrain the federal government, to resist runaway spending and to uphold the principles of fiscal responsibility. Yet in power, it does what it condemns in others, sometimes more.

The issue isn’t just the spending; it’s the insistence that the spending doesn’t exist, or that only Democrats are to blame. It’s not the sin, it’s the sanctimony, and hypocrisy hits harder when it’s wearing a halo.

Democrats admit to spending; Republicans deny it and expect applause for the illusion. But illusions don’t last forever.

Indeed, it may be voices within the Republican Party itself,likeSens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)andMike Lee (R-Utah), who finally expose the party’s glaring conflict between message and action in a way voters cannot ignore.

When that image cracks, Republicans may regret it. Voter tolerance tends to evaporate in the face of deception.

Today, that experiment has quietly produced results that should be making national headlines. Instead, it’s met with a curious indifference that reveals something broken about our politics and media.

To better understand that disconnect, I spent months in New Orleans interviewing more than 50 people about their experience over the past two decades. I heard from both critics and champions of the city’s Katrina recovery reforms: parents, students, teachers, principals, administrators, activists, academics, and common citizens. Their stories are important and illuminating. I even created a whole podcast about them, calledWhere the Schools Went.

But it’s easy to fall into the tyranny of the anecdote when reporting on fraught education debates like those over the meaning of the New Orleans reforms. So let’s start with the data instead. Hard numbers are more useful than speculation. And the hard numbers from New Orleans are overwhelming.

There’s no one better at parsing the data than Doug Harris, who chairs Tulane’s economics department and directs the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans. Harris has spent years analyzing these outcomes with the kind of methodological rigor that usually prevents education researchers from ever saying anything definitive about anything. His team of advisors includes both reform advocates and skeptics, yet when I spoke with him, Harris offered something virtually unheard of in education research:an unequivocal conclusion. “If you look at any of the typical things that we measure — test scores, high school graduation, college going, college persistence, ACT scores — all of those things are not just better, but quite a bit better than they were before.”

The fine print is striking. When Katrina hit in 2005, roughly 60% of New Orleans schools werelabeled “failing”by the state. Today, that number is zero. High school graduation rates have soared from 54% to 78%. College enrollment has jumped by 28 percentage points. Students across all demographics — Black, white, low-income, students with disabilities — haveposted dramatic gainsthat would be the envy of almost any school system in the country.

Harris’s team anticipated and tested the obvious objection: that the student population must have changed after such a massive displacement like Katrina. Perhaps the student body became more affluent? Less needy? They worked with the U.S. Census to track who actually returned, andtheir findingdeflates the skeptics’ favorite excuse: “The demographics of the district changed for families that had school-aged children… almost not at all.” Even more compelling, when they tracked individual students who attended school both before and after Katrina, those same children were learning at faster rates in the new system.

Yet if you scan the national education discourse today, you’d be hard-pressed to find any major elected leaders talking about New Orleans. This represents a dramatic shift. A decade ago, President Barack Obama himselfcelebratedthe city’s progress, telling a New Orleans audience in 2009 that “a lot of your public schools opened themselves up to new ideas and innovative reforms,” and that “we’re actually seeing an improvement in overall achievement that is making the city a model for reform nationwide.”

But that early attention has given way to virtual silence. This silence isn’t accidental — it’s the result of a success story so politically inconvenient that it threatens the foundational beliefs of both sides of America’s education debate.

To understand why this success story became politically radioactive, look no further thanGeorge Washington Carver High School. Originally built in the 1950s as one of the city’s first high schools for Black students, Carver embodied the flawed promise of separate-but-equal education. By the 1990s, it had become what historian Walter Stern called an “educational Soweto” — astruggling schoolin a neglected neighborhood with graduation rates hovering around 50% and repeated failing grades from the state.

ThenKatrina destroyedboth the school and its surrounding Ninth Ward community. Karl Washington, a Carver alumnus, remembered the aftermath: “That area received eight, nine feet of water. It wiped out everything: the community footprint, businesses, spirit.” But the alumni were determined to rebuild Carver.

The state agreed, but then came the question of who would run it. The alumni community had their vision: a return to the Carver they remembered, with its proud traditions of football, marching band, and community connection.

The state had different ideas. Instead of awarding the charter to community leaders, officials chose Collegiate Academies, an organization founded by Ben Marcovitz, a Harvard graduate from Washington, D.C., who had achieved remarkable academic results at his Sci Academy charter school campus. Marcovitz’s schools were data-driven, disciplined, and relentlessly focused on college preparation. They were also run primarily by young, white outsiders through programs like Teach for America.

This staffing approach was particularly inflammatory given what had happened to New Orleans teachers after Katrina. When the district ran out of money, all 7,500 employees — including every teacher in the city — werelaid off en masse. Most were never rehired. Many of these teachers were Black women who had been pillars of the city’s middle class for decades. They had deep roots in the communities they served. To see them replaced by young, college graduates, many of them white, with minimal teaching experience (and no union contract) felt like salt in an open wound. I explore this painful history in Episode 3 ofWhere the Schools Went.

The backlash to the state’s Carver plans was immediate and fierce. Chris Meyer, a state official tasked with explaining the decision, recalled arriving to find “a human chain in front of the building” and protesters blocking the entrance. After managing to get inside, “I get two words, maybe three outta my mouth, and the whole meeting just erupts in chaos.” When Meyer left the meeting, he found his car windows smashed, with glass scattered across his child’s car seat.

Jerel Bryant, the Yale-educated principal chosen to lead the new Carver, walked into this firestorm. His team quickly produced strong academic results, posting some of the best algebra scores in the city. But the achievement felt hollow amid growing community resistance.

The breaking point came in December 2013, when 60 studentswalked out in protest. They were frustrated by what they saw as excessive discipline: having to walk on taped lines in hallways, getting suspended for chewing gum or wearing the wrong shoes. One studenttold reporters: “You get suspended for coughing. You get suspended for sneezing out loud.”

The Southern Poverty Law Centercriticizedthe school’s suspension rates. Three parents publicly withdrew their children, though the vast majority stuck with the program. Local newspapers published side-by-side graphics showing Carver’s academic gains alongside its suspension statistics, as if to ask: At what cost?

For critics of education reform, this was the perfect story: test scores rising through harsh discipline and cultural suppression. For supporters, it was proof that change inevitably faces resistance, even when it’s working. The battle lines were clear, the rhetoric heated, and the national media seized on the drama. The Atlantic ran not one buttwo major pieceson Carver’s discipline policies.The Hechinger Reportcalled it “the painful backlash against ‘no-excuses’ school discipline.”

But then something unexpected happened.

Had I visited Carver 10 years ago and stopped my reporting there (as many national outlets have), this would be a very different story — one that fit neatly into our national education wars. But over the past decade, something remarkable happened.

By 2014, Carver’s principal and his team began to listen more carefully to their critics. “Even when I didn’t agree with their tone or tactics or priorities,” Bryant reflected, “I didn’t doubt that they wanted the school to be great. And finding that common ground—that’s the challenge, and the opportunity.”

The school began implementing what educators call “restorative practices”—mediations and healing circles instead of suspensions. They trained staff differently, built new programs, funded the marching band, and hired more teachers from the community. Most importantly, they connected these changes to their core mission rather than treating them as distractions from it.

“Strong sports teams help with suspension rates,” Bryant explained. “Engaging lessons help with suspension rates. Connecting before you correct, that helps too. A kid has to really believe: I want to be part of this. Otherwise, we lose a powerful lever to change behavior.”

The results were dramatic. Suspension ratesdroppedby nearly two-thirds in a single year. But rather than hurting academic performance, the changes seemed to enhance it. Last year, Carverearned an Afor academic growth from the state and ranked second among all open-enrollment high schools in New Orleans for students achieving mastery on state exams. The year before, they had the highest academic growth in the state. Oh, and their boys’ basketball team? They’ve been to three straight state championship games and wonback-to-back titlesin 2022 and 2023.

When I visited the school this spring, the transformation was evident everywhere. The trophy case displayed sports trophies and homecoming photos alongside college acceptance letters. The staff was older, more rooted in the community, and included several Carver alumni who had returned as teachers and coaches. Even Sandra, who works in the cafeteria, glowed when talking about the school: “The teachers? Marvelous. The principal? Excellent. Everybody here is loving and kind.”

Eric French, the band director and Carver alumnus, broke down crying when describing what it meant to return to his alma mater: “It was like a dream come true. When I walked into the interview, I almost broke down. I knew if I could just get my foot in the door, it would be up from there.”

Nell Lewis, the school’s director of culture, had lived through the entire transition: “The community didn’t believe at first. They saw white folks, outsiders, people who didn’t understand. But now they see the results. We didn’t used to have academic success here. We had championships, but not college. Not like now.”

Of course, cafeteria workers praising their workplace and band directors getting emotional about their alma mater don’t generate the same headlines as student walkouts and community protests. Collaboration doesn’t click like conflict. Which helps explain why the current New Orleans story — technocratic problem-solving, gradual improvement and former adversaries working together — has been largely ignored by those who thrive on drama and division.

What happened at Carver was part of a broader evolution occurring across New Orleans. In the immediate aftermath of Katrina, the city had operated what could charitably be called an “anti-system” — dozens of autonomous charter schools with little coordination or oversight. This approach produced impressive academic gains but also created chaos for families trying to navigate wildly different enrollment processes, discipline policies and academic calendars.

By 2012, state leaders began implementing what they called “systems building.” They createdOneApp, a centralized enrollment system that gave families one application for all schools citywide. They establishedcommon discipline policiesand centralized expulsion hearings to prevent schools from pushing out challenging students. They developed aweighted funding formulathat sent more resources to schools serving students with greater needs.

Most importantly, they approached these changes collaboratively. Rather than mandating from above, the Recovery School District convened school operators to build consensus around shared systems. The result was something unprecedented in American education: a system that preserved school-level autonomy while creating citywide coherence around the functions that mattered most for equity and access. Schools could still choose their own curriculum, pedagogical approach, and staffing model. But they couldn’t cherry-pick students, ignore due process for discipline, or operate in isolation from families’ needs.

This evolution produced a model that should theoretically appeal to both sides of America’s education debates. It delivered the academic results that reformers promised while addressing the equity and community concerns that critics raised. It proved that choice and accountability could coexist with collaboration and local input.

Instead, it has been met with bipartisan silence.

For progressives, acknowledging New Orleans’s success would require confronting some uncomfortable truths. The Katrina recovery transformation was built on the elimination of teacher tenure, the dissolution of union contracts and the replacement of neighborhood school assignments with choice-based enrollment (subjects we cover at length in episodes 3 and 4 ofWhere the Schools Went). These are precisely the policies that national Democratic leaders now oppose.

President Joe Biden has called himself “not a charter school fan.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren warns that charter expansion “strains the resources of school districts and leaves students behind.” The party has increasingly embraced a defensive posture that treats any deviation from the traditional district model or unequivocal support for teachers’ unions as an attack on public education itself.

But the old, pre-Katrina New Orleans had all the elements that progressives now champion as essential: a powerful teachers’ union, centralized administration, neighborhood school assignments and an elected school board. It also had some of the worst educational outcomes in the country.

For conservatives, the New Orleans model presents an equally uncomfortable problem. The city’s success came not through pure market forces but through a limited but aggressive government intervention. The state stepped in to close failing schools, coordinate enrollment, standardize discipline policies and redistribute resources based on student needs. They also relied heavily on government-mandated standardized testing to gauge school quality. This is hardly the small-government, laissez-faire approach that conservative education reformers typically champion.

Moreover, if more districts could become as responsive and effective as New Orleans, there would be less demand for the private school vouchers and education savings accounts that have become conservative orthodoxy. Why abandon public education if it can actually work?

The media, meanwhile, has moved on to more sensational stories. The current New Orleans narrative doesn’t generate clicks or cable news debates. It’s the educational equivalent of reporting on a well-functioning water treatment plant: critically important but insufficiently dramatic for our attention economy.

This silence comes at a significant cost. New Orleans offers genuine lessons for other cities struggling with educational inequity, not as a perfect model to replicate but as proof that dramatic improvement is possible when leaders are willing to experiment, listen and adapt.

The city’s approach suggests a middle path between the extremes that have dominated education debates: neither the rigid centralization that characterized many urban districts nor the unchecked autonomy that marked early charter experiments. Rather it demonstrates what former state superintendent John White called “coherence” — clear communication and a well-articulated philosophy around what government should control and what schools should decide for themselves.

“You attracted some great people, many from within the system, many from without,” White explained. “You held them very accountable for doing their jobs. You resourced them proportionate to the challenges, and you set very clear boundaries around what you were gonna be involved with and what you weren’t gonna be involved with.”

This approach could work in districts with or without charter schools, with or without choice programs. It’s fundamentally about governance: being strategic about where to centralize and where to decentralize, building systems that support both equity and excellence, and creating space for both innovation and accountability.

Perhaps most importantly, New Orleans demonstrates something that feels almost impossible in our current political moment: the capacity for opposing sides to actually listen to each other and change course based on what they learn.

The reformers who dismissed community concerns about culture and representation gradually recognized that academic success without community buy-in was unsustainable and immoral. The community leaders who initially rejected any changes to traditional approaches came to appreciate that good intentions weren’t enough if children weren’t learning.

This wasn’t compromise for its own sake but genuine evolution based on evidence and experience. Today, many of the harshest critics of early reform efforts acknowledge the system’s improvements while continuing to push for better. Many reform leaders have become more sophisticated advocates for equity and community engagement.

As education advocate Chris Stewart, who grew up in New Orleans, put it: “We want to be transparent, but not loud. New Orleans should keep doing what they’re doing. They should keep winning and improving. But it doesn’t help to nationalize their story anymore.”

Perhaps Stewart is right that New Orleans benefits from flying under the national radar. But the rest of the country pays a price for ignoring what’s happened there. In an era when Americans seem incapable of finding common ground on any contentious issue, New Orleans offers a rare example of adversaries becoming collaborators, of ideology yielding to evidence, of a community choosing pragmatic progress over perfect ideological purity.

That’s a lesson worth learning, even if it makes everyone a little uncomfortable."

TheCampus Guardian Angelsystem represents the most aggressive deployment of automatedsecurity technologyin American schools, turning what sounds like dystopian fiction into Monday morning reality.

These aren’t your typical surveillance drones hovering quietly in corners. Campus Guardian Angel’s machines packpepper ball launchers, glass-breaking tools, and enough kinetic force to physically knock down an assailant. Remote operators in Austin, Texas pilot the drones from a tactical command center, streaming live video to first responders while deploying countermeasures that would make a Call of Duty player jealous. The system can blanket large campuses with30 to 90 dronesstored in tamper-proof charging stations, ready to swarm at the press of a silent alarm.

Florida’s$557,000pilot program launches this September across three districts, with full operational status planned for January 2026. Schools pay$1,000 monthlyfor the service plus$15,000per six-drone storage unit—pricing that positions the technology as a premium security upgrade rather than standard equipment.Miami-Dade CountyPublic Schools has shown interest, though the state education department hasn’t revealed which districts will test the waters first. If you’re wondering whether your local school budget can handle military-grade drone defense, the answer depends on how seriously administrators take the 15-second promise.

Critics raiseuncomfortable questions about high-speed machines navigating crowded hallways and the wisdom of automating split-second decisions about using force. The drones can hit50 mphindoors and100 mphin open areas—speeds that could turn a false alarm into a different kind of emergency. Operator training standards remain unclear, and no one knows how the system performs when chaos erupts and every second counts. Real-world testing will determine whether these rapid-response capabilities enhance safety or introduce new hazards.

The pilot’s results will likely influence security policies nationwide, potentially normalizing robotic enforcement in spaces we still consider fundamentally human. Whether this technology prevents tragedies or creates new risks, Florida’s experiment will answer a question many hoped we’d never need to ask: How much automation should guard our children?"

The shooting took place at 7 p.m. Aug. 9 in the 2700 block of North 60th Street. The man who died in the incident wasidentified by the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Officeas 31-year-old Dandre McIntosh.

The incident began with police investigating a vehicle related to multiple business robberies that was found at the rear of a residence, according to police.

While in the rear of the home, McIntosh appeared from the second-floor balcony with a gun.

""He's got a gun!"" officers can be heard yelling in the video. ""Drop the gun!""

Seconds later, gunfire erupts. It's not clear from the released videos if McIntosh fired the gun at officers, but the police department said its news release that ""gunfire was exchanged between the suspect and officers."" The police department said no officers were struck.

Milwaukee police didn't immediately respond to questions on Aug. 25.

The department said four officers fired their weapons in the incident.

As McIntosh lay wounded from officers' gunfire on the balcony, officers yelled commands of ""Drop the gun!""

An officer can be heard on the video saying, ""He shot himself in the head. ... He just shot himself."" The video was indistinct if McIntosh fired off a self-inflicted round.

Chief Jeffrey Norman said at a late-night news conference on Aug. 9 that it was unclear whether McIntosh died from officers' gunfire or a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The medical examiner's office's Aug. 11 demographic report, a document with information on someone who died and the cause of death, classified McIntosh's death as a homicide. The office classifies homicide as any death caused by the intentional act of another person.

McIntosh can still be seen in the video moving on the balcony.

""He's still alive!"" that same officer yells. ""He's still moving. He's still got the gun in his hands. Drop the gun!""

""Stop moving!"" the officer said as more gunfire goes off. It's unclear if that gunfire was from officers or McIntosh.

""Put your hands up, dude,"" the officer yells. ""But we can't come to you as long as you still got that gun.""

McIntosh sustained fatal injuries and a gun was recovered next to him, police said.

The officers have only been identified as the following:

A 46-year-old man with over 21 years of service

A 36-year-old man with over eight years of service

A 30-year-old man with over five years of service

A 29-year-old man with over 11 years of service.

The Brookfield Police Department is leading the investigation to satisfy state law requiring an outside agency.

The Italian Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) reported strong ash emissions from the volcano's summit craters on Monday, prompting authorities to raise the highest alert level for air traffic.

Mount Etna, which rises to more than 3,300 metres, is Europe's largest active volcano. It erupts regularly and is under constant monitoring, with its spectacular displays attracting large numbers of spectators.

Catania's international airport remains open for now, as of Tuesday. However officials are recommending travellers check with airlines to determine whether the volcanic eruption is affecting already booked flights. Travellers can also find updates on theCatania Airport website.

A package holiday booked in the EU can also be cancelled without incurring fees if it is significantly disrupted by extraordinary circumstances. However this requires that the holiday destination is directly affected by the volcanic eruption.

Italy'sNational Institute of Geophysics and Volcanologyoffers detailed updates on the activity of Italian volcanoes (in English and Italian), covering Mount Etna and the Stromboli volcano on the island of the same name.

Experts generally advise regularly checking online resources like these before travelling to a volcanic region. Your country's foreign ministry will likely also offer advisories and travel warnings for your destination.

In many countries, national authorities provide warnings and information about natural hazards on their websites, often in English. Additionally, holidaymakers can ask for specific advice at hotel receptions or from their hosts.

Mount Etna had already erupted in June, with a huge column of smoke causing days of cancellations before the local airport could reopen.

There are over 1,500 active volcanoes worldwide, some of which are located in holiday regions. As such, volcanic eruptions are not uncommon, and for some intrepid travellers they are even reason to fly to a destination, not avoid it."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/milwaukee-man-gets-life-pair-100226516.html,2025-09-05 10:30:00,"Milwaukee man gets life in pair of shootings, including one that killed a pregnant woman","Tynesha Crawford was pregnant when prosecutors say Quran Robey shot her to death nearly two years ago.

Now, Robey is going to prison for the rest of his life.

The sentence was handed down Sept. 3 by Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Laura Crivello.

Robey, 29, of Milwaukee, pleaded guilty in November to first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless injury in connection with Crawford's Nov. 19, 2023, shooting death and another shooting that occurred just a few hours earlier.

Prosecutors say Robey fatally shot Crawford, a pregnant mother of four, during an argument near 33rd and Center streets.

According to a criminal complaint, a man was shot at a BP gas station on the 7300 block of West Appleton Avenue that night on Nov. 18, 2023, just before 9 p.m.

Surveillance video showed the victim leaving the gas station and going to his parked vehicle when another man arrived in a gray 2007 Saturn Ion and entered the gas station with a gun in hand. The video showed the gunman leaving and walking to the victim at the gas pumps.

The gunman then shot the man in the upper left leg.

According to the complaint, the gunman later approached the victim and helped the injured man from the ground, hugged him, then fled in a different vehicle – a Ford Escape.

Footage captured inside the store provided investigators with clear images of the gunman's face and the distinct black jacket he wore with the word ""Scarface"" on the back, the complaint said. It also recorded an image of the Saturn's license plate.

Police recovered two 9mm casings at the scene.

The victim was interviewed by police. He told them the gunman said he was mad, had lost his keys and ""had a bad day with his girlfriend,"" before apologizing to the victim and leaving the scene, the complaint said.

Investigators talked to owner of the Saturn, who identified Robey from still images of the surveillance footage.

Hours later, at 2:11 a.m. on Nov. 19, 2023, police were called to an apartment on the 2700 block of North 33rd Street for a report of a shooting.

Officers arrived to find Crawford dead in the threshold of a bedroom. She had been shot multiple times.

According to the complaint, Crawford's four children, ages 1 to 13, were home at the time. Investigators spoke with the oldest child, who told them her mom’s boyfriend, later identified as Robey, came over around 1 a.m. and confessed to Crawford he had shot someone earlier that night.

Crawford and Robey argued about the gas station shooting, and the teen told authorities Robey pulled out a handgun, the document says.

The two adults continued to trade words, but at some point, the argument apparently shifted; Crawford, who was on the phone, told her friend, ""I really like girls,"" which set off Robey, who according to the complaint threatened Crawford.

Seconds later, the teen witness heard three gunshots.

With her life quickly fleeting, Crawford managed to call 911.

Crawford is heard in the 2:11 a.m. recording first.

""I need, yes,"" a struggling Crawford says.

Right away, a male's voice is heard:

""On my momma she got me (expletive) up.”

""What is your emergency?"" the 911 dispatcher asks.

Crawford tries to respond, then three gunshots are heard.

""Oh my god, he just shot me,” Crawford said.

The recording also captured the male voice repeatedly asking for her keys, as other commotion erupts in the background and children are heard crying and yelling.

Moments later, a child's voice comes on the line.

""My momma got shot,” says the child, who, according to the complaint, also told the dispatcher the mother’s boyfriend was responsible.

Robey was arrested at a hotel on Milwaukee's south side on Nov. 19, 2023.

Police recovered a 9mm handgun in the room, and also located a ""Scarface"" jacket there.

He admitted to investigators he shot both Crawford and the victim at the gas station. Tests done on casings found at both crime scenes showed they were fired from the same gun, according to the complaint.

Court records show Robey wasn't supposed to have a firearm in the first place.

Robey was convicted in 2018 of taking and driving a vehicle without consent in October 2017.

He was convicted later in 2018 of attempted arson of a building and bail jumping for offenses that occurred in March 2018.

Sentences in both cases were made to run consecutively and totaled four years incarceration and four years of extended supervision.

As a result of those convictions, Robey was prohibited from possessing a firearm and ordered to be incarcerated in October 2018.

Robey was released Nov. 15, 2022, court records show.

And one American studies professor says there’s a lot to take away from the icy reception.

Trump made his first appearance at the U.S. Open as a sitting president on Sunday afternoon to watch the match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. The last time Trump attended the tennis tournament was in 2015, when he was a candidate for president.

Life:The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Aug. 30-Sept. 5)

There were several times on Sunday when Trump didn’texactlyreceive a resoundingly warm welcome at Arthur Ashe Stadium in his native New York City borough of Queens.

The presidentfaced a mix of boos and cheerswhen he briefly appeared at the stadium about 45 minutes before the match began — and when the stadium was still mostly empty, the Associated Pressreported.

Trump was latermet with loud boosand some cheers when he was shown on the jumbotron during the national anthem. And he facedmore boosfor a longer period of time when he was featured again on the big screen at the end of the first set, the AP reported.

While the president has since appeared to focus solely on the positive reception he received from people at the stadium (he later told reportersthat he thought the U.S. Open fans were “great”),many peopleon social mediahave beencelebratingthe audible boos heard in clips making rounds on the internet.

Others accused the U.S. Tennis Association of censorship after it was reported that the organizationdirected broadcastersto “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions in response to the president’s attendance in any capacity.”

A USTA spokesperson latertold The Athleticthat the organization regularly asks their broadcasters “to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions.”

“Trump getting booed is exactly what America needed to see today!”one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

“Listen to the boos in the Crowd as Trump arrives at the U.S. Open stadium. America is catching on,”wroteanother.

“Trump claps for himself at the #USOpen — stadium erupts in boos. Broadcasters told not to air protests. Democracy on mute,” one X useradded.

Kari J. Winter, a professor of American studies at the University at Buffalo, told HuffPost that the president getting booed at the U.S. Open was significant because “freedom of expression is the essence and foundation of democracy.”

“Our right to voice our opinions is enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,” she said.

“The booing makes people happy because it demonstrates how many of their fellow Americans share their dismay at what is happening in the U.S.,” Winter said. “A growing majority of Americans as well as our friends abroad are horrified to witness the way the Trump administration is eroding democracy.”

Indeed, despite Trumproutinely touting his administration’s successesin his second term as president, polling continues to suggest thata majority of Americans disapproveof the president’s job performance overall.

“Because the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court are failing in their duties to provide checks and balances and to uphold the rule of law, our only hope as a democracy comes from widespread public resistance to the Trump administration’s escalating war on everything good in American society,” Winter said.

Winter then pointed to Trump’s infamous 2005“Access Hollywood” interview, in which he was caught on a hot mic making obscene remarks about grabbing women by the genitals, as an example to emphasize that the president “is a bully who derives gratification from imposing his will on vulnerable people and staging spectacles of violence.”

“He makes it clearer with every passing day that he will continue escalating his assaults on people, on the rule of law, on the economy, on decency as long as we let him do it. He has no moral compass,” she said.

And as it relates to the USTA, Winter said that the organization’s reported efforts to suppress reactions to Trump at the U.S. Open is “anti-democratic,” “cowardly” and “sycophantic.”

“What does the USTA think it will gain by censoring that reality?” she said, before later adding: “The sustained jeers and occasional cheers constituted a remarkable, memorable component of the event. To attempt to censor that reality is a form of white-washing history while it is unfolding. It is a form of truth-denial and disinformation.”

“Access to truth and accuracy is a basic human right,” she added.

But as theYellowstone Safari Companyexplained Tuesday via social media, there's a ""little indicator"" that signals an impending eruption.

The accompanying footage shows the indicator becoming active before the main event.

The company explained: “If you see that little spout start spitting water, that means that any time within the next 20 minutes, you will be treated to a geyser eruption that is both longer and taller than Old Faithful!”

According to the park,Beehive Geyseris a “favorite performer” in the Upper Geyser Basin, but only erupts once or twice per day at unknown times.

Eruptions typically last 4-5 minutes, and water columns can shoot 150-200 feet, so it’s quite a show.

The Dark History Behind The Brewery's Family Dynasty,"The new Netflix seriesHouse of Guinnessofficially premiered on the streaming platform on September 25, 2025.

The period drama is ""inspired by true stories"" and includes real-life historic figures, like Sir Benjamin Guinness' four children.

However, series creator Steven Knight admits that he took creative license in the project and ""fill[ed] in the gaps"" himself while writing the script.

If you love a scandalous historical drama and/or splitting the G, boy, do I have a show for you. The creator ofPeaky Blinders, Steven Knight, is reunitingwith Netflixfor another gritty period saga packed with sibling rivalry, secrets, andperfectly poured pints.

ICYMI, the streaming platform dropped all eight episodes ofHouse of Guinnesson Thursday—and yes, if you haven't picked up on my hints already, it is indeed aboutthatGuinnessfamily. The series follows the aftermath of patriarch Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness' death, his four children, and the feud that erupts between them after the reading of his will. And while I'm sat for the show nonetheless (and canceling all weekend plans to binge every single episode), the premiere begs the question: How true is the story?

The series opens with a quick disclaimer that the plot is ""inspired by true stories,"" but what exactly does that mean? Well, the characters in the show—specifically, Guinness' four adult children—are all real historical figures and part of the family dynasty. Some ""remarkable"" (and very real!) events from the family's history also play out on the show, but according to Knight himself, there was definitely a bit of creative license to come up with the rest of the script.

""There’s no Facebook, no Instagram pages,"" he told Netflix’sTudumof his research for the project. ""What I had to do is take things that these family members did, things that they said, achievements they made, mistakes that they made, and use them as stepping stones. Then I had to fill in the gaps myself.""

So the answer is...sorta! While the premise, characters, and some of the key events are very much real, not everything from the series is 100% true. However, that's pretty much the case with every historical drama.

""[The scripts] are rich, full of brilliant characters—a piece of history. Tonally, it’s playful, funny, smoky, hot, and at the heart of it is a great story with a great family dynamic,"" series star James Norton said. ""The show has everything—rich characters, brilliant relationships, and a hot, textured world to learn about.""

While there is plenty to unpack, let's start with a few of the key storylines that were very much part of the family's history. For starters, Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness was indeed the grandson of brewery founder Arthur Guinness. He took over in 1839 and left it to his sons, Arthur and Edward, in his will,People Magazinereports.Yet the dynasty would later be shadowed by scandal, with heirs dying young or falling into addiction—tragedies that fueled whispers of a ""Guinness curse.""

Arthur was also involved in the political scene in Ireland. He was elected Conservative MP for Dublin in 1868. His election was voided due to his election agent's bribery, though Arthur himself was not personally found guilty of the unlawful efforts. And while he did receive a death threat in 1872, it wasn't actually related to his second Parliament run. Decades later, the family’s name would resurface in darker headlines, from theassassination of Walter Guinnessin 1944 to theGuinness share-trading scandalof the 1980s.

Like Knight pointed out, there are plenty of exaggerated (and straight-up fictional) moments in the series. But...what were the fictional plot lines? In the series, Benjamin forces Arthur and Edward to take on brewery leadership or lose their inheritance altogether. However, that wasn't the case. In reality, they could have bought each other out for £30,000 plus half the stock value.

Edward is also shown in the series as the mastermind behind Guinness moving into the American market in the 1870s, but the beer was first shipped to America long before Edward took over, the outlet reports.

And while much of the cast is based on real people, there were a few fictional adds, like Edward's illegitimate cousin and business partner, Byron Hedges, as well as Irish Republican Brotherhood leaders Patrick and Ellen Cochrane. Though it is important to note that the revolutionary group was very much real in Ireland at the time.
