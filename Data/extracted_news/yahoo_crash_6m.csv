“It was a mess this morning,” a New Jersey resident told theNew York Post. “If I’d known, I would have waited because I heard they were telling people at the bus stop to take the train, but I didn’t understand why they were doing that.”

“I never knew where I was,” the resident added. “It really threw me off.”

Shortly after the accident, the Port Authority Bus Terminal was shut down.

""We initially had some difficulty getting up the ramp, because it backed traffic up behind it,"" Saffon said. ""But we worked with the Port Authority police to open up the exit ramp so we could go up the wrong way and get our ambulances up there.""

The NJ Transit buses were diverted to Secaucus, Newark Penn Station and Hoboken, N.J. The passengers on those buses were instructed to take the PATH to get to New York.

Then, around noon, NJ Transitissued a statementthat the bus service traveling to and from the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal began “operating on or close to schedule.”

(QUEEN CITY NEWS) — A motorcycle crash victim is asking county leaders for change after he waited more than 30 minutes for medical personnel to respond.

He wants to make sure no one else has to wait longer than he had to.

“The fire department showed up in about 5 minutes — less than 5 minutes, I believe. And then we waited, and the fire department said ‘Hey, where’s the ambulance? We need them emergency traffic‘ and they’re like ‘oh, yeah, we’re still 10 minutes away.‘ I’ve been on the ground for 10 minutes already,” Ullman recalled.

MORE |As Charlotte grows, so do 911 calls – and the burden on firefighters

He’s recovering from a broken arm from a June motorcycle crash. Bystanders called 911, but he waited more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.

“All I wanted was to get to the hospital so they could start treating me,” Ullman said.

He spoke before Mecklenburg County Commissioners on Tuesday about emergency response times, hoping they could find a resolution.

“Every minute matters when you’re lying on the pavement, scared, broken in pain, unsure, time moves different. Each minute feels like an eternity. The fire department sat with me for 15 of those minutes, helpless because there was nothing they could do in their scope of practice,” Ullman said.

The area firefighters’ association wants leaders to address the long-standing issue of emergency response times with Medic. Chiefs say firefighters are spending too long on scenes waiting for Medic crews to arrive, keeping them from other emergencies.

“We continue to hear the discussion referencing 300 fire trucks within the county. The reality, those 300 trucks, only about 100 are staffed full-time time ready to roll at a moment’s notice. Citing the large number inflates expectations while ignoring operational facts. We need you to focus on the reality of our emergency response resources,” said Charlotte Firefighters Association President Mark Finis.

Mecklenburg County fire chiefs met with commissioners and Medic officials on June 26 to discuss the growing population and the best ways to decrease response times.

“The goals as they are written today for Medic, in our contract, don’t work anymore. The way that we have built this system and built Medic to be accountable for response times makes it show that we are 98% compliant, when in reality. It’s 60 something,” said Medic executive director John Peterson.

Ullman hopes the conversation leads to change.

“All the taxpayers deserve better. Every resident. No one should have to wait 20 minutes for an ambulance,” Ullman said.

Huntersville Fire officials sent Medic a memorandum of understanding and are hoping for a response soon.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/residents-along-busy-street-concerned-024235862.html,2025-07-03 05:00:00,"Residents along busy street concerned by speeding cars, frequent crashes","DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) — Acar crashed into a home on Valley Streetover the weekend, but local residents say this is not the first time something like this has happened in the area.

2 NEWS spoke to multiple neighbors who say Valley Street has been a dangerous stretch of road for years. While police officials have not released what causedthat crash on Sunday, people living on Valley Street say speeding has been the primary cause of numerous incidents in the past.

While the speed limit is 35 miles per hour, the 2 NEWS team saw several cars going faster than the posted limit in just a single evening. For a narrow two lane road with lots of people nearby, this can have dangerous consequences.

On Sunday, acar crashedinto a parked vehicle and a home, with the family inside narrowly avoiding injury.

Along other parts of Valley Street, the same scene has played out many times over the years. Many neighbors can recall several instances during their time on Valley Street.

“We heard a loud crash followed by a bang and looked out the window. A car had hit the telephone pole and flipped end over end, and ended up in our front yard,” said Jeremy Doyle, local resident.

Another crash happened just months after, getting even closer to disaster.

“My girlfriend was working at the front of the house, a car came speeding through our yard and hit the front of the house,” said Doyle. “Scared the daylights out of her.”

Doyle says he’s reached out to Dayton officials looking for solutions, but has yet to hear anything back.

Further up the street, an auto scrapyard caught a crash on their security cameras, as a driver crashed into a customer’s vehicle and narrowly missed hitting two people standing outside.

“It’s pretty much a daily, either there’s an accident or there’s something, you know, very close calls all the time, almost every day,” said Emron Obbasov, nephew of owner, T&S Towing and Auto Recycling.

The owner says there’s a bend in the road at the corner of Valley and Valleycrest that is the setting of weekly accidents from speeding cars.

Obbasov believes there must be a solution to keep the crashes from happening.

“At least one speed bump or something, or like a speed trap, like a speed camera. Because it’s getting ridiculous,” said Obbasov.

One resident walks Valley Street everyday, and with there being no sidewalks along a good chunk of the road, he’s merely an arm’s length away from cars speeding past.

“Just put in a stoplight or some speed bumps at least,” said William Bussell, local resident. “Just slow down, man, I mean, they’re in a hurry to get nowhere fast.”

2 NEWS has reached out to Dayton’s civil engineering office on any upcoming projects to help slow down drivers. They were unavailable for comment.

Musk is seizing operational control at a time when the EV maker is scrambling to stabilize sales in Europe. According to the latest data, TSLA registrations were down 61.5% in Denmark and 64.4% in Sweden last month.

Note that Tesla stock is currently down some 18% versus its May high.

Continued declines in European sales is a major red flag for Tesla investors given the region is the company’s second-largest market and a key pillar of the global EV demand.

TSLA shares slipped on Tuesday because registrations down 60%-plus in both Denmark and Sweden signals intensifying competition, particularly from its Chinese rivals.

The aforementioned weakness is significant given EV adoption at large is growing at an exciting pace across the continent – suggesting Tesla is losing share.

In short, the regional slump undercuts revenue forecasts, pressures margins, and raises questions about brand perception, potentially making it more difficult for Tesla stock to extend gains moving forward.

Tesla is scheduled to report its delivery numbers for the second quarter on Wednesday, July 2.

According to JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, the EV maker’s Q2 deliveries could come in as much as 19% below its year-ago figure, potentially triggering another leg down in Tesla shares in the near term.

In a research note this morning, Brinkman also said there’s a “material risk to the outlook for full year deliveries” as he reiterated his $115 price target on the EV stock, flagging a more than 60% downside risk from current levels.

While not nearly as bearish as JPM, other Wall Street firms recommend against buying Tesla stock at current levels as well.

According to Barchart, the consensus rating on TSLA shares currently sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of about $297 below its current trading price.

Jota was in the car with his 26-year-old brother, Andre, a footballer for FC Penafiel inPortugal, who also died. No other vehicles wereinvolved in the crashshortly after midnight local time, Spanish authorities said.

The car left the road after a tyre blew out during the overtaking of another vehicle, the Spanish Civil Guard toldThe Independent. A charred patch of grass divides the two carriageways of the northwestern A-52 motorway, where the crumpled body of the Lamborghini lay before it was removed on Thursday.

Liverpool FC said they were “devastated” by Jota’s death and requested privacy for the family as they come to terms with an “unimaginable loss”. The Portuguese star scored 65 goals during five years at the club, in which he played a major role in a host of trophy wins.

Jotamarried long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children, in Porto less than two weeks ago. “A day we will never forget,” reads the caption of his last Instagram post, which shows a video of the wedding day.

Tributes poured in throughout Thursdayfrom players, clubs, sporting figures and football fans, who just months earlier witnessed Jota win his first Premier League title.

Liverpool manager Arne Slot said the “sense of shock is absolute” for the club.

“Diogo was not just our player,” he said. “He was a loved one to all of us.

“I could say so much about what he brought to our team but the truth is everyone who watched Diogo play could see it. Hard work, desire, commitment, great quality, goals.

“The essence of what a Liverpool player should be.”

Slot said the player “never sought popularity” but gained it anyway and was a friend to everyone, able to make others feel good about themselves “just by being with them”.

He said the last time they spoke he wished Jota luck for his upcoming wedding.

“In many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this,” Slot added.

The Portugal international joined Liverpool from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 and established himself as a key attacker under Jurgen Klopp and latterly Arne Slot, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup in his five-year spell at Anfield.

Wolves said Jota was “adored by our fans, loved by his teammates and cherished by everyone who worked with him”. They added: “The memories he created will never be forgotten.”

The Portugal national side said Jota was “not only a fantastic player with almost 50 caps ... but also an extraordinary person who was respected by all his teammates and opponents”.

Jurgen Klopp, who signed Jota from Wolves and was his manager at Liverpool until 2024, said he was “heartbroken” by the news.

“This is a moment where I struggle!” he posted on Instagram. “There must be a bigger purpose! But I can’t see it! I’m heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother André.

“Diogo was a not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father! We will miss you so much! All my prayers, thoughts and power to Rute, the kids ... and everyone who loved them! Rest in peace.”

National teammate Cristiano Ronaldo paid tribute on Instagram. “Doesn’t make any sense,” he wrote. “Just now we were together in the national team, just now you were married.

“To your family, to your wife and children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. I know you will always be with them.”

Portuguese prime minister Luis Montenegro posted on social media: “The news of the death of Diogo Jota, an athlete who greatly honored Portugal’s name, and his brother is unexpected and tragic. I extend my deepest condolences to their family. It is a sad day for football and for national and international sports.”

Porto FC, a major club in Jota’s home city where he played on loan during the 2016-17 season, said it is “in mourning” after the death of Jota and Andre, who was also in the youth ranks.

Many current and former players paid tribute. Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher said: “Devastating news about Diogo Jota & his brother Andre this morning.

“Thoughts are with everyone of their family & friends, especially his wife Rute & their three lovely kids.”

Harvey Elliott, a Liverpool youngster who made his debut shortly before Jota joined, left a heartfelt tribute for his teammate. “I can’t put into words how much this hurts us,” Elliott said.

“You were an incredible footballer... the kind that made a difference every single time you stepped on the field. You were humble, hardworking, kind, and always there for anyone that needed anything.

“I feel so lucky to have shared the pitch with you, shared memories and moments I’ll carry with me forever. You’ll always be part of this team, part of the Liverpool family, We will never, ever forget you.”

Darwin Nunez, another Liverpool teammate, said there are “no words to comfort you for so much pain”. He added: “I will always remember you with your smile, as a good teammate on and off the field.”

Jota’s former Wolves teammate and Portugal international Ruben Neves said: “They say that we only lose people when we forget them. I will never forget you.""

Steven Gerrard, one of Liverpool’s greatest-ever players, said: “RIP Diogo. Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time.”

Prince William said in a post on X that as “part of the footballing family” he was “deeply saddened” to hear of Jota’s death.

And tennis legend Rafael Nadal said it was “sad news” and offered his “thoughts and affection” to Jota’s family.

Darts star Stephen Bunting, a well-known Liverpool fan, posted a picture of him alongside the footballer.

He wrote: “Such sad news I’m hearing. RIP Diogo Jota. What a lovely person. Such a sad day for the football world and beyond. Only just married too. My heart goes out to the family and we are all sending our prayers.”

The governing body for European football, Uefa, said it is “deeply saddened” to hear of Jota’s loss, while a host of Premier League clubs offered their condolences.

Born in Porto in 1996, Jota joined the Pacos de Ferreira youth setup in 2013 before making his senior debut in autumn 2014.

He first appeared in Portugal’s top division in February 2015, becoming the youngest player at his club to score in the top division. Jota joined Spanish club Atletico Madrid in 2016, before his move to the Premier League one year later.

After starring for Wolverhampton Wanderers for three years, he stepped up to a Liverpool team who had just won the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp.

Already known for his pace, dribbling and lethal ball-striking ability with both feet, Jota arrived at Anfield in 2020 and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club in all competitions. He also made 49 appearances for Portugal, twice winning the Uefa Nations League."

A Cessna 208B plane was in the air for minutes after taking off at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown before reports of a downed aircraft emerged just before 5.30 p.m. on Wednesday, according to theFederal Aviation Administration.

All 15 people on board were taken to the Cooper University Hospital in Camden to be treated forinjuriesin what the Gloucester County Emergency Management called a “mass casualty incident” in a FacebookpostWednesday.

Three people with critical injuries were taken to the hospital by a helicopter, the agency said. Trauma surgeons were at the scene triaging the victims, a Cooper spokesperson told theNew York Times.

Footage captured by Philadelphia-based6abc Action Newsshowed bodies being stretchered away by emergency personnel in the aftermath of the crash.

Twelve others on board were being treated with “less severe” or minor injuries, they added. Several of those injured were reportedly covered in jet fuel.

“It's amazing at this point that there are no fatalities reported,” Andrew Halter of Gloucester County OEM said.

“There are some injuries reported to be severe or critical,” he continued. “Again, people received tremendous medical treatment on scene, a joint effort between police officers, firefighters and EMS crews who first arrived at the scene.”

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy tweeted that he had been briefed on the crash and confirmed that there had been “no fatalities at this time.”

The Cessna, which was leased to Skydive Cross Keys, had reported engine trouble before the crash, Halter said. The pilot tried circling back around and attempted to land at Cross Keys Airport but was unsuccessful.

Federal and local authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.

The incident comes just days after a small twin-engine plane crashed in Ohio,killing six people.

On Sunday morning, shortly after that plane took off from the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport, it crashed in a heavily wooded area.

The plane was carrying two experienced crew members and four passengers when it crashed and caught on fire, local officials said.

Howland Fire Chief Ray Pace said the “extremely tragic situation” could have been worse, as the plane crashed near two or three houses."

The startling admission may come with deadly repercussions. More than 3,000 Americans die incrashes involving a distracted driverevery year and nine people are killed every day.

Teen drivers are at a heightened risk for distracted driving than those in other age groups. In 2019, a higher percentage of fatal crashes involving distracted drivers were tied to those between the ages of 15 and 20 years old than drivers who were 21 years old and older, according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One recent study from AAA found that driver inattention, or being engaged in other activity, was involved in58 percent of teen crashes.

“Driving distracted doesn’t just put the driver at risk of injury or death; it puts everyone else on the road in danger of an accident,” Dr. Rebecca Robbins, of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in astatement. “The findings from the study give us insights into the perceptions and beliefs from teenage drivers, which can be used to help create effective interventions to prevent distracted driving.”

Robbins is a founding member of Mass General Brigham and the lead author of the research, which was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journalTraffic Injury Prevention. The study — co-authored by researchers in Germany and at other U.S. universities — was funded by the Casey Feldman Foundation, which is named in honor of a 21-year-old woman who was killed by a distracted driver in 2009.

To reach these conclusions, the authors analysed data compiled during 20 interviews with high school students and a survey of more than 1,100 teen drivers across the U.S. They were hoping to pinpoint which factors influenced the teens to engage in distracted driving.

They found that teen drivers spend an average of 21.1 percent of each trip looking at their phone, and 26.5 percent of their glances away from the road lasted for two seconds or longer — a duration which dramatically increases their risk for a crash. Taking your eyes off the road for even five seconds at 55 miles per hour is similar to driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed, according tothe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The most common reason cited for the teen drivers’ distraction was entertainment, followed by texting and navigation.

Furthermore, teen drivers recognized that they understand distraction at the wheel is associated with negative outcomes, but also said they believe that their peers drive distracted.

Across the country, more than 35 states havebanned all types of phone usage for young drivers. However, in a previous national study, 91.8 percent of adolescents reported “regularly engaging” in at least one distracted driving behavior per trip.

“We found that while young drivers recognize the advantages of using smartphone features like GPS, they also understand the heightened risk of accidents associated with distracted driving,” said Robbins. “Encouraging the use of ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode, keeping phones out of reach and ensuring teens get adequate sleep are effective strategies to mitigate this dangerous behavior.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/explainer-international-carbon-credits-fight-113935854.html,2025-07-03 12:00:00,Explainer-Do international carbon credits fight climate change?,"By Kate Abnett

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission has proposed an EU climate target for 2040 that allows countries to count carbon credits bought from developing nations towards the EU goal for the first time.

Here's what that means, and why the EU move on Wednesday faced criticism from campaigners and some scientists.

WHAT ARE CARBON CREDITS?

Carbon credits, or offsets, involve funding projects that reduce CO2 emissions abroad in place of cuts to your own greenhouse gas emissions.

Examples include forest restoration in Brazil, or converting a city's petrol buses to electric. The buyer counts ""credits"" for those emission reductions towards its climate goal, and the seller gets finance for their green project.

Proponents say the system generates much-needed funding for CO2-cutting efforts in developing nations and lets countries work together to cut emissions around the world.

However, the reputation of CO2 credits has been dented by a string of scandals in which credit-generating projects failed to deliver the climate benefits they claimed.

WHY IS THE EU BUYING THEM?

The European Commission proposed allowing up to 3 percentage points of the EU's 2040 target - to cut net emissions by 90% from 1990 levels - to be covered by carbon credits bought from other countries.

The EU's existing climate targets require countries to meet the goals entirely by cutting emissions at home.

The bloc's executive Commission said last year it hoped the EU could agree a 90% emissions-cutting target for 2040, with no mention of carbon credits.

Tumultuous geopolitics and the economic woes of European industries have since stoked political pushback, with governments from Germany to Poland demanding a softer target.

In response, the Commission said it would add flexibilities, and landed on carbon credits as a way to retain a 90% emissions-cutting goal while reducing the domestic steps needed to reach it.

EU countries and the European Parliament must negotiate and approve the goal.

WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

The EU plan was welcomed by countries including Germany, which had pushed to include carbon credits in the goal, and by carbon credit project developers as a boost for climate finance.

But environmental campaigners said the EU was shirking domestic CO2-cutting efforts and warned against relying on cheap, low-value credits.

The EU's climate science advisers had also opposed buying credits under the 2040 target, which they said would divert money from investments in local clean industries.

The EU banned international credits from its own carbon market after a flood of cheap credits with weak environmental benefits contributed to a carbon price crash.

To try to address the risks, the Commission said it would buy credits in line with a global market and rules for trading carbon credits which the U.N. is developing. These include quality standards aimed at avoiding the problems that unregulated credit trading has faced in recent years.

Brussels will also propose rules next year on specific quality standards for the carbon credits the EU buys.

HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?

The EU doesn't yet know. Carbon credit prices today can be as low as a few dollars per tonne of CO2, up to more than $100, depending on the project.

EU emissions records suggest the bloc would need to buy at least 140 million tonnes of CO2 emissions to cover 3% of the 2040 target, roughly equivalent to the Netherlands' total emissions last year.

One senior Commission official said the bloc was determined not to hoover up cheap junk credits.

""I don't think that would have any additional value. The credits we see currently on voluntary carbon markets are very, very cheap, and that probably reflects a lack of high environmental integrity,"" the senior official said.

Jeannie K. Hall, 43, of Collins Street, Westfield, accepted the plea agreement after initially declining to accept an agreement that would have had her serve three months in the Hampden County House of Correction, which was requested by a Hampden County assistant district attorney, according to court documents.

The family of Aleksandr Vdovichenko of Westfield, the man who died after Hall crashed into his wheelchair in September 2024, requested she not be jailed on the charge, according to court documents.

She was also placed on probation for two years.

Hall was charged and arraigned on a single count of motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation on Dec. 2. She pleaded not guilty and was released on personal recognizance, according to court documents.

The incident that led to Hall’s plea occurred at about 4:30 p.m., Sept. 8.

She was driving her Hyundai Kona eastbound on Franklin Street when she told State Police investigators she became distracted just moments before hitting Vdovichenko’s motorized wheelchair.

There was a witness to the crash.

The witness told the investigators that she had stopped her vehicle at the end of Kellogg Street to allow Vdovichenko to cross the street’s crosswalk in his wheelchair.

After he crossed Kellogg Street, the witness said Vdovichenko immediately turned left onto Franklin Street crosswalk and started across.

He safely crossed the westbound lane and was in the eastbound lane when struck by Hall’s car.

He was transported to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield where he succumbed to his injuries. Investigators noted that the crosswalks, across Franklin and Kellogg, had been newly painted.

The witness also told investigators “that she observed the driver of the suspect vehicle to be traveling at a fast rate of speed (speed limit is 35 mph) for the area,” according to court documents.

During the State Police Crash Analysis Reconstruction Section, the operating system of Hall’s vehicle was downloaded and “showed that the Hyundai Kona that Hall was operating was traveling at 42 mph.”

The report also noted that “there were no obstructions to visibility while traveling east on Franklin St.”

After the crash, Hall remained at the scene and admitted to investigators she had been distracted moments before the crash.

Vdovichenko was the third pedestrian death in the city since 2021.

On Sept. 12, 2021, a man was struck by a car at the intersection of Mechanic and Bartlett streets and died the next day of his injuries, according to crash data compiled by the state’s Department of Transportation.

On May 5, 2023, a woman crossing at the pedestrian crosswalk on Elm Street near the District Courthouse and CVS died after being struck by a vehicle, according to Police Department logs.

From July 3 to July 6, DPS will ramp up patrols across the state as part of Operation Crash Awareness Reduction Effort (CARE). The goal? Keep drivers safe and crack down on dangerous behaviors like speeding, drunk driving, and ignoring the state’s Move Over, Slow Downlaw.

“The Fourth of July is a time to celebrate our freedoms with family and friends, but safety must come first,” said Highway Patrol Chief Bryan Rippee in a recentannouncementfrom the DPS. “Whether you’re on the road, on the water or handling fireworks, make smart choices that protect you and those around you. Let’s work together to ensure everyone has a safe and happy Independence Day.”

Last year’s Fourth of July crackdown was no small effort:troopers handed out over 59,000 citations and warnings.

In total, that included more than 5,000 tickets for speeding, over 1,500 citations for drivers without insurance, and hundreds of additional violations for those not wearing seatbelts. The DPS alsoarrested 212 people for driving while intoxicatedand250 more on various felony charges.

This year, DPS is urging drivers to plan ahead if they’re drinking, always buckle up, and avoid distractions behind the wheel, aka no texting or fiddling with apps while driving.

And don’t forget to slow down and move over for emergency vehicles and tow trucks stopped on the road;it’s not just courteous, it’s the law.

Along with a focus on enhancing road safety, the department is also reminding Texans tohandle fireworks responsibly.

Some of their precautions include: Lighting them only in open areas away from buildings, always having water handy, and never letting young kids handle fireworks. After your firework show, it is also recommended to soak all used fireworks in water before tossing them out.

Firework injuries tend to run rampant on July 4th.

In 2024,11 people died in incidents involving fireworks, with most of those tragedieslinkedto improper use or malfunctioning fireworks, per the Consumer Product Safety Commission. That same year, an estimated14,700 individuals sustained injuries from fireworks– a big jump of around 38% in fatalities and 52% in injuries compared to 2023.

Sparklers alone accounted for about 1,700 emergency room visits in 2024."

(WOOD) — Deputies say a fleeing vehicle ran a red light in Holland Township early Thursday morning, causing a crash with a semi-truck that shut down a section of northbound US-31 for several hours. Both drivers were injured.

It happened around 4:20 a.m. Initially, the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office said it responded to the area of Felch Street and Beeline Road for a report of a fight in progress. The fight reportedly involved several people and a silver Hyundai Elantra.

Traffic conditions

Deputies said when they arrived on scene, the Hyundai had fled, and the people who remained would not cooperate.

Just minutes later, a deputy found a crash nearby, at US-31 and Felch. The crash involved the Hyundai and a semi-truck pulling two loads of rock, which had overturned.

Investigators said the driver of the Hyundai, a 24-year-old man from Holland, was heading east on Felch when he ran the red light at US-31. Meanwhile, the semi-truck was northbound on US-31 and could not avoid the crash, according to the sheriff’s office.

The Hyundai’s driver was airlifted to a Grand Rapids hospital with serious injuries, deputies said. They said the driver of the semi-truck, a 60-year-old man, was taken to the hospital by ambulance for injuries that were not considered life-threatening. Both vehicles were heavily damaged.

Northbound US-31 was shut down for hours after the crash. It reopened around 10:20 a.m., according to the Michigan Department of Transportation.

Authorities continue to investigate.

How prosecutors' argument in Sean Combs' federal trial fell apart. And a Liverpool soccer star is killed in a car crash.

Here’s what to know today.

Lawmakers in the House pulled an all-nighter on the massive domestic policy package for President Donald Trump’s agenda, as a handful of Republican holdouts stalled the procedural “rule” vote for several hours.

Five Republicans had initially joined Democrats in voting “no” on the procedural vote, including members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, as well as the center-right Republican Main Street Caucus and Republican Governance Group.

But after hours of negotiations, most of the Republican holdouts flipped their votes and the House advanced the bill by a vote of 219-213. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., was the only Republican who voted against the rule.

This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign uphereto get it in your inbox.

Asked how he was able to win over the Republican holdouts, Johnson told reporters, “There was just a lot of patience and listening to everyone’s concerns and making sure that their, their concerns were addressed.”

The Senate-approved version of the “big, beautiful bill” would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military and make significant cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy funding. It would also raise the debt limit by $5 trillion.

Freedom Caucus leaders were unhappy about the Senate bill increasing the deficit and not going far enough on clean energy and Medicaid, and other GOP House members were unhappy with the more aggressive Medicaid cuts in the Senate bill, along with a series of clean energy funding rollbacks.

Trump joined Johnson’s all-day efforts yesterday to sway holdouts by holding meetings and making phone calls. Overnight, the president ramped up his pressure on holdouts in a social media post. “What are Republicans waiting for???” he wrote. “What are you trying to prove???”

Sean ""Diddy"" Combswas acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking chargesin his federal trial but found guilty on two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. For the hip-hop mogul and his defense team, the jury's verdict was seen as a win. But it was a blow to the Southern District of New York.

The seven-week trial saw federal prosecutors attempt to paint Combs as someone who used his power, wealth and influence to lead a ""criminal enterprise"" to sexually abuse and exploit women for over two decades. Jurors heard from almost three dozen prosecution witnesses, including graphic testimony from Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura.

Combs' defense team, on the other hand, didn't call a single witness, didn't dispute their client's history of domestic violence, and acknowledged that Combs arranged drug-dazed, marathon sexual encounters called ""freak offs."" The team's ownership of those allegations might have had a strong influence over the jury's decision, legal experts and former federal prosecutors said.

After the verdict was read, Combs fell to his knees in prayer. His family stood in the background, clapping and cheering. Outside the New York City courthouse, Combs' supporters celebrated with baby oil, an apparent reference to the substance that witnesses said was provided for the ""freak offs.""

U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian set a sentencing date of Oct. 3 and denied Combs' team's request that he be released from prison until then. Subramanian cited the attorneys' own words — ""we own the domestic violence"" — in arguing that Combs is a danger to others.

Economists also expect the BLS's June report to show the unemployment rate at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.

(WSYR-TV) — Multiple people started the day in the hospital after a pursuit of a stolen car ended in a messy crash on Syracuse’s southside.

According to the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Office, just after 1 a.m., Syracuse Police spotted a stolen Hyundai Tucson, prompting a traffic pursuit with the sheriff’s office. Syracuse Police decided not to pursue due to their policy. Sergeant Thomas Blake of the Syracuse police department spoke on the department’s decision.

“A number of things come into play, not only the safety of the public but also the safety of the person operating the vehicle,” Blake said. “We have to be as smart as possible for that.”

Deputies chased the car for about a minute before it crashed at the intersection of Kenmore and West Newell Street, right by McKinley Park.

The Sheriff’s Office said the stolen car crashed into another car not involved in the pursuit. The impact pushed that car into a utility pole, which toppled over. Three people were inside the vehicle that got hit, including a toddler and a pregnant woman.

The two adults were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. The two-year-old was also taken to the hospital as a precaution.

As for the stolen car, we were told the occupants are 15, 16 and 17 years old. After the crash, deputies say they ran from the scene but were quickly caught. That group was also taken to the hospital, but they were not hurt. Each received an appearance ticket and was turned back over to his or her parents or guardians.

“With the ‘Raise the Age’ and the bail reform that went into place a few years ago, most of the time with a stolen vehicle recovery that leads to an arrest, it’s an appearance ticket,” Blake said.

“It’s amazing that at this point there are no fatalities reported,” Halter said, per CNN. “Just the fact that we have 15 people that are still with us here today, some with minor injuries, I think is fantastic and remarkable.”

NBC Newsnotes that three people are being evaluated at Cooper University Hospital’s trauma center in Camden, New Jersey, and eight people with less severe injuries are being treated in its emergency department, Wendy A. Marano, a spokesperson for the hospital, said.

Per the outlet, Marano also confirmed that four other patients with “minimal injuries” are waiting for further evaluation, though she wasn’t able to provide the exact nature of the injuries.

According to footage shared viaWPVI, stretchers and emergency vehicles were captured in the woodland area near the runway.

Halter said that an investigation is ongoing to identify the cause of the engine failure and subsequent crash. He also noted, per CNN, that the aircraft sustained substantial damage in the accident.

Flight tracking data fromFlightRadar24indicates the plane was dropping rapidly at a rate of 3,008 feet per minute shortly before the tracking data ceased.

(WBTW) — Members of the public will be able to pay their respects to a27-year-old Darlington County deputywho died in a shootout with a suspect Tuesday night.

The body of Devin Mason will lie in honor in the rotunda of the Darlington County courthouse from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday, Coroner Todd Hardee said. He will be buried on Tuesday in his hometown of Fair Bluff, North Carolina.

Mother of man who shot, killed Darlington County deputy lied about where he was before ambush, SLED says

Authorities said Mason was shot and killed when he and another deputy were “ambushed” inside a mobile home on Old Timers Court near Lamar, where they went at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday to look for a man wanted on conspiracy and forgery charges.The second deputy, whose name has not been released,was hospitalized but was recovering at home on Wednesday.

The suspect, Cameron Ray Dennett, was also killed in the shootout. Deputies also arrested Kristen Porter, 28, at the scene. She was booked into the Florence County Detention Center on criminal conspiracy and forgery charges because of arrest warrants issued there.She posted a $16,000 bond Wednesday morningand was released.

Mason leaves behind a 2-month-old son, a fiance, and his mother and his stepfather, according to the group Serve & Connect, which announced a fundraiser to benefit his family in partnership with the South Carolina Law Enforecment Officers Association, the South Carolina Police Chiefs Association, the South Carolina Sheriff’s Association and the South Carolina Fraternal Order of Police. It has raised more than $15,000 for his family,Serve and Connect said.

The shooting is being investigated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which said the shooting is the 28th officer-involved shooting in the state this year and the first one in Darlington County. There were 45 across the state in 2024.

Mason is the second Darlington County Sheriff’s Office officer killed in the line of duty, according to theOfficer Down Memorial Pagewebsite. Sheriff Alton Grinnell died in an automobile crash on July 11, 1945.

The Darlington County courthouse is at 110 N. Main Street.

A new research trip to a desert island in the South Pacific may reveal what happen to Amelia Earhart in 1937

Researchers will visit Nikumaroro in November to investigate the Taraia Object, a visual anomaly believed to be remnants of Earhart’s plane

Some everyday items found near the site on the uninhabited island include a woman's shoe, a medicine vial and a makeup bottle from the 1930s

Some everyday objects found on a desert island in the Pacific Ocean may help researchers discover what really happened toAmelia Earhart.

The ground-breaking aviator, who set out to become the first woman to fly around the world in 1937,vanished about a month into her global journey.

On July 2, 2025, the 88th anniversary of Earhart’s disappearance, the Purdue Research Foundation and Archaeological Legacy Institute (ALI) announced a joint effort to find the pilot’s missing aircraft. The research trip will visit the Pacific island of Nikumaroro in November 2025 to investigate the Taraia Object, a visual anomaly some believe to be remnants of Earhart’s plane.

Through documentary records, photos, satellite images, physical evidence and personal testimony, researchers developed theNikumaroro hypothesis— the idea that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, landed on an uninhabited island instead of crashing at sea.

Some of the evidence found includes everyday objects believed to have belonged to Earhart: a woman’s shoe, a compact case, a medicine vial and a bottle of freckle concealer.“She had freckles,” senior NBC correspondent Tom Costello said during a segment about the mission on TODAY on July 2. “So [there's] a lot of evidence that in fact Amelia Earhart and her navigator crash landed on this remote island.”

According to earlier reporting byNBC, the jar found is ""identical in shape"" to a bottle of Dr.‭ ‬C.‭ ‬H Berry's Freckle Ointment, which promised to make freckles fade, sold in the early 20th century.

The researcher who discovered it told the outlet, ""It's well documented Amelia had freckles and disliked having them.""

Additional evidence pointing to Nikumaroro includes three recorded radio transmissions converging near the island.

“What we have here is maybe the greatest opportunity ever to finally close the case,” Richard Pettigrew, ALI’s executive director, said in apress release. “With such a great amount of very strong evidence, we feel we have no choice but to move forward and hopefully return with proof. I look forward to collaborating with Purdue Research Foundation in writing the final chapter in Amelia Earhart’s remarkable life story.”

The expedition will begin on Nov. 5, departing from Majuro in the Marshall Islands for Nikumaroro, which is about halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Reachers will spend five days on the island inspecting the Taraia Object and will return to port on Nov. 21.

But some experts are still skeptical. Ric Gillespie, an author who’s written about Earhart’s disappearance, claims the new expedition won’t find anything.

“We’ve looked there, in that spot,” he toldTODAYof his 12 expeditions to the South Pacific. “There’s nothing there."" Of the object thought to be her plane, he says ""the [satellite] imagery shows a coconut tree, complete with root ball.”

Though, Pettigrew says it isn’t an easy find.

If the crews are successful in identifying and locating the aircraft, a second expedition will commence in 2026 to excavate what remains.

It started about 7:25 p.m. Thursday night when a Bell County Sheriff’s Deputy attempted to make a traffic stop on a vehicle near FM 2484 and I-35. The driver sped off and failed to respond to the deputy’s lights and siren. The driver continued northbound entering the main lanes of I-35, then drove through the median to get off in south Belton. The driver then continued evading until he reached the 2600 block of Leroy Lane in Belton. While he was attempting to make a U-turn in a cul-de-sac the car left the roadway and struck an electrical box.

The driver was then taken into custody without further incident.

He was identified as 31-year-old James Austin Ryan Welborn of Salado. He was initially booked into the jail on charges of driving while license suspended with no insurance. Deputies also presented charges of evading arrest in a motor vehicle, with jail records indicating a further charge was pending.

The vehicle had been reported stolen earlier in the day.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-arrested-1-deadly-boat-153700242.html,2025-07-03 17:00:00,Man arrested 1 year after deadly boat crash near Howard Frankland Bridge,"A Tampa man who authorities say was under the influence of alcohol when he crashed a boat into a construction barge near the Howard Frankland Bridge last July,killing his passenger, has been arrested.

Travis Stewart, 39, was arrested Wednesday, one day short of the first anniversary of the crash in Tampa Bay that threw 43-year-old Jonathan Boucvalt overboard, records show. Stewart is facing charges of boating under the influence manslaughter and leaving the scene of a vessel homicide, among others.

An arrest affidavit was not immediately available Thursday, but information previously released by authorities about the crash, as well as publicly available search warrants, shed some light on the case investigated by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

The crash happened about 4:15 a.m. July 2, 2024, when a 20-foot boat with two people on board collided with a barge near the Howard Frankland Bridge. Boucvalt was thrown into the water. Stewart, who was injured in the crash, left the scene in the boat and was later treated at a hospital, according to wildlife officials.

Wildlife commission officers responded along with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Tampa Police Department to search for Boucvalt, whose body was found later that day north of the crash scene.

Investigators went to the barge after construction workers called authorities and said it appeared it had been struck by another vessel, search warrant affidavits state. On the barge, investigators found blood, some of Boucvalt’s personal effects and broken glass consistent with alcohol containers, as well as fiberglass that appeared to be from Stewart’s boat, the records state.

Investigators determined that the barge’s green and amber lights were working at the time of the crash.

“Due to the size of the barge and the working perimeter lights, a safe and prudent operator would have been able to see and avoid striking the barge,” a search warrant affidavit filed by wildlife commissioner investigators last August states.

Stewart told investigators that he was operating the boat at the time of the crash because Boucvalt was not familiar with the waterway, according to the affidavit.

“Moreover, the evidence left at the scene and the physics of the collision indicate that Boucvalt could not have been driving at the time of the crash,” and the nature of Stewart’s injuries also indicated he was at the helm, the affidavit states.

Stewart also admitted to being intoxicated at the time of the crash, and medical staff at the hospital where he was treated told an investigator his blood alcohol level was higher than 0.08, the level at which a boater is presumed impaired under Florida law, according to the affidavit.

Investigators obtained search warrants for Stewart’s medical records and data from the boat’s GPS system.

Stewart also faces three counts of violation of navigation rules causing serious bodily injury or death. He was booked into Hillsborough County’s Orient Road Jail on Wednesday and was being held Thursday without bail, records show. He works as a project manager for a medical company, according to booking information.

Boucvalt was a father of three who lived in LaPlace, Louisiana,according to his obituary.

“Jonathan lived a spirited life, leading with love and light,” the obituary says. “In these hard times, he encourages us all to live in such a way. To think of him not with thoughts of sorrow, but with the joy he made us all feel.”

Stewart has two previous DUI arrests in Hillsborough County, court records show.

After a 2008 DUI arrest, Stewart pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of reckless driving and was sentenced to one year of probation. After another DUI arrest in 2011, he was given a year of probation and his driver‘s license was revoked, records show.

More details about the cases were not available Thursday."

The Minnesota State Patrol says a driver ran a stop sign in a two-vehicle crash that left one person dead and four others injured Wednesday evening.

According to the crash report, a 63-year-old Hinckley man, identified as Kameron L. Ellis, was driving a 2021 Ford F-150 eastbound on Highway 48 when his truck was struck around 6 p.m. by the driver of a 1999 Ford F-150.

Both trucks wound up in the southeast ditch.

Ellis was pronounced dead at the scene.

Four occupants of the other Ford were injured, including a passenger who suffered life-threatening injuries. The ages of the passengers haven't been disclosed, but the driver was a 40-year-old man from Cambridge. All four were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center for care.

Bettison spoke of the teen victims on Wednesday night, June 2, before his biweekly ""Walk-A-Mile Wednesdays"" in the community. All the shootings have the same theme, he said — they've stemmed from some sort of argument with feelings of disrespect and shame and have resulted in violence. They include a 4-year-old bystanderkilled while playing at a park, and a 15-year-old killed over a pair of shoes.

And ""the common denominator is, these teens shouldn't have guns,"" he said. ""When it comes to parental responsibility, check your teens' rooms. Ensure that they don't have access to your firearms. Because when they do, things like this happen.""

Children getting shot and killed isn't something the city should normalize, Bettison said. So when it comes to fighting violent crime in Detroit, he made a promise: ""I will not stop, ever.""

The stretch of bloodshed began Friday, June 27, when 4-year-old Samir Josiah Grubbs was shot to death before he could make it up the slide's ladder at Skinner Playfield and 18-year-old Dayvion Shelmonson-Bey was killed, too. A 17-year-old was also shot and survived. Bettison also said that two teenagers were arrested in the case, but charges haven't been filed by prosecutors as of Thursday, July 3.

An argument over shoes on Sunday, June 29 was settled with gunfire at a home on Mark Twain Street, Bettison told the Free Press. A 15-year-old was killed, and his sister, 13, was grazed by a bullet. That same day, a 16-year-old was shot and killed on Margareta Street.

And on Tuesday, July 1, a 17-year-old was shot in the head at the Martin Luther King Jr. Homes and was in critical condition.

Violent crime overall is down in Detroit, according to city data. Homicides are down 20% as of July 1, compared with this time last year. Nonfatal shootings are down 30%.

But the number of youth shot this week is what Bettison and community violence intervention leaders in the cityhave been working to avoidduring the summer months that often bring more violence to the city.

Both say they have been proactive in their approach — Detroit police deployed its park units and started cracking down against illegal activity like unlawful block parties and street racing starting in the spring, and violence intervention groups have engaged youth in summer programs and inserted themselves in disputes in order to de-escalate and prevent further bloodshed.

There's not a single issue to point at when dealing with youth gun violence, said Quincy Smith of the violence intervention group Team Pursuit. There are layers, he said, like poverty, family instability, and a lack of abundance of resources. Many times, the motivation for violence is money, he said.

""If we had the abundance of resources, employment opportunities, access to these types of things, their mindset wouldn't even be on violence, because they would be too preoccupied with things that would be more productive,"" Smith said.

There's also a culture of violence that many young people have just accepted, he added — ""they call it crash out time.""

And while Smith said there's not one single issue one can point to for the reasons behind gun violence, he did point to the state legislature as part of the solution and urged them to fund public safety, including violence intervention groups, and the social detriments that are the root causes of violence.

""Our legislatures have to do what's right. They've got to step up to the plate,"" he said. ""In the meantime, we're losing babies.""

It’s a rare, although natural phenomenon; and naturally, people panicked.

The video comes from Praia de Buarcos, a beach enclave about 88 clicks north from Supertubos and Peniche, where the World Surf League holds their annual Championship Tour contest. And the event happened over the weekend, turning a sunny beach day into a strange, stormy, and panicked scene in a matter of minutes. See the footage below:

“It was nuts to have experienced this rolling cloud in the north of Portugal,” one witness wrote onX, also supplying another angle of the cloud, which is perhaps even scarier, even more unusual than the one in the video above. “Felt like a tsunami out of a movie! Apparently it was 150km long, stretching from Figueira da Foz all the way up to Vila do Conde, which is close to where I was.”

Related: Psychic Predicts Devastating Tsunami on July 5th, 2025

So, what was it?

According to the cloud experts (real thing), it was an Arcus Cloud, also known as a “roll cloud.” For more information, here’s theCloud Appreciation Society(also a real thing, and side note, how do we join?):

“They form as the cold air that is dragged down by all the precipitation falling within the storm splays outwards upon reaching the ground. As it spreads around the storm, it burrows beneath the warmer, less-dense air at ground level. This is lifted most forcefully in the direction of the cloud’s movement, forming a ‘gust front’, in which the warmer air’s moisture can condense into water droplets that appear as the shelf of cloud.”

“These ‘tow truck bandits’ monitor radio traffic and rush to crash scenes, posing as helpful tow truck operators,” the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Officeposted on InstagramWednesday.

The post goes on to say that once the operators tow your car, they demand outrageous fees or refuse to return the vehicle until the inflated charges are paid.

“This is fraud—and it’s illegal,” the DA’s Office states.

Motorists were urged to watch out for the following red flags after an accident:

Tow trucks that show up before you call a tow company or police

Tow drivers who insist on taking your car to a specific body shop

Tow drivers that offer a ride share for you

The post also shared tips to protect yourself:

Wait for police to arrive at the scene before agreeing to have your vehicle towed

Ask officials whether anyone from emergency services called a tow truck for you and if so, which company

Verify the tow truck company with your insurance or the California Highway Patrol

Do not sign any documents until you have spoken with your insurance company

Drivers were urged to report suspected tow truck fraud to local law enforcement or the California Department of Insurance at 800-927-4357.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/record-breaking-july-4th-72-183429306.html,2025-07-03 19:15:00,Record-Breaking July 4th: 72 Million Americans Set To Travel,"If you feel like the roads and airports have been busier lately, you’re not imagining things.

72 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home between June 28 and July 6, a 2.4% jump from last year, and a whopping 7 million more travelers than in 2019.

Almost 62 million travelers, or 85% of all holiday voyagers, will hit the road by car. That’s the highest number ever recorded for the July 4th travel period.

AAA’s Texas officesuggeststhat road trippers should plan ahead:pack an emergency kit, check those tires, and don’t forget to fill up before heading out.

Last year, AAA came to the rescue nearly 700,000 times during the holiday week for everything from dead batteries to flat tires and, yes, drivers locking themselves out of their cars.

Gas prices are friendlierthan many expected, too.

Despite some recent jitters in the oil market driven by conflict in the Middle East and the looming hurricane season, summer gas prices remain the lowest since 2021, under the Trump administration.

For Texans staying close to home, popular routes include the classic Houston-to-Galveston stretch down I-45, which is expected to see heavy traffic in both directions on weekends.

From July 3 to July 6, the Texas Department of Public Safety willintensify patrols statewideas part of Operation CARE (Crash Awareness Reduction Effort). The initiative aims to keep roads safer by targeting risky driving behaviors such as speeding, driving under the influence, and failing to follow the state’s Move Over, Slow Down law.

As previously reported byThe Dallas Express, officers issued around 5,000 speeding tickets, more than 1,500 citations to uninsured drivers, and hundreds of tickets to people not wearing seatbelts during their July 4th crackdown in 2024. In addition, DPS arrested 212 people for DWI and another 250 on various felony charges last year.

If your plan involves a TSA line, you’ll have plenty of company.

More than 5.8 million people are expected to fly over the holiday period, a slight increase over last year’s record. The average domestic round-trip ticket price sits around $810, up 4% from last summer.

Travel expertssuggest booking midweek flights, such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays, for better deals and fewer headaches, according to AAA.

Beyond cars and planes, nearly 4.8 million Americans will travel by bus, train, or cruise. That number is just shy of the pre-pandemic record set in 2019.

Where are Americans going?

When it comes to destinations, it’s amix of classic summer hotspots and bucket-list cities.

Domestically, Orlando, Seattle, and New York top the charts. Alaska cruises are also peaking, and Hawaii’s beaches are calling, according to the report.

Internationally, Canadians will see many American tourists in Vancouver, while Rome, Paris, and London remain the European favorites.

Timing Is Everything

If you’re driving, when you leave matters as much as where you’re going.

According to traffic data firm INRIX, theworst times to be on the road are generally afternoon and early evening hours, especially on July 2 and July 6.

The best strategy?Hit the road early, before noon, and try to avoid the midday bottlenecks.

AsDXhas previously reported, late-night driving on weekends can be especially deadly in the Lone Star State, regardless of whether it’s a holiday weekend or not.

Data based on NHTSA crash records from 2019 to 2023 revealed that the hoursbetween 9 and 10 p.m. are the deadliest on Texas roads. On average, 254 fatal crashes occur during this hour each year, accounting for more than 6% of the state’s total, the highest number among the ten most populous states in America."

And it sounds like he's just as heartbroken as everyone else.

Diogo Jota and André Silva died in a single-car crash near Zamora, Spain, after their Lamborghini drove off the road and burst into flames. Jota had gotten married just weeks beforehand to Rute Cardoso, with whom he shares three children. He had just wrapped up a season where Liverpool had won the English Premiere League title.

Ronaldo shared a black-and-white photo of Jota to his 660 million followers.

""Doesn't make any sense,"" he said of Jota's tragic and unexpected death in a translated caption. ""Just now we were together in the National Team, just now you were married. To your family, to your wife and children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. I know you will always be with them. R.I.P. Diogo and Andre we will all miss you.""

Police are still investigating the crash, which occurred after midnight local time.According toThe Associated Press, the brothers' bodies are undergoing forensic analysis. Officials did not immediately reveal who was driving at the time; reports indicate they are investigating a potential blown tire, which may have occurred as the brothers tried to pass another vehicle.

Jota's final match was June 8, when he helped the Portuguese National Team win the Nations League. His Liverpool coach and many other players have also spoken out about the tragedy.

Jade Shonesued the city and former Tempe police Officer Zachary Hyde, claiming he was negligent, careless and reckless when he sped through a red light in Mesa after immediately turning his sirens on. The suit further argues Tempe failed to provide oversight and training for its officer.

Shone’s lawsuit detailed injuries to her neck, back and abdomen, and how the heartbeat of the child she was expecting, whom she named Isla, stopped.

The police report listed a second person whose vehicle was struck, and both Shone and this other injured person were taken to the nearby Banner Desert Medical Center.

Two months after the crash with Shone,Hyde was arrested on suspicion of DUIwhile off duty.

A DUI offense report from July 31 by DPS detailed how Hyde was pulled over in a Mercedes-Benz that showed damage to the front bumper and had been seen swerving. Hyde, the report continued, showed slurred speech, watery eyes, the smell of alcohol and struggled to walk after exiting his vehicle.

According to the report, Hyde told the DPS officer he had two beers three hours prior. A breath test determined he had an alcohol level of 0.205%, according to the DPS report.

Tempe City Council approved the $2.1 million settlement on July 1.

Future Bail Bondsexamined five years of crash data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to reveal where and when drivers face the greatest risks on Independence Day. Between 2019 and 2023, 2,394 people lost their lives on July 4th alone, underscoring a hidden danger of the holiday.

Montana ranks as the deadliest state to drive in on Independence Day, with afatal crashrate of 15.75 per million residents, more than double the national average of 6.63.

The most dangerous hour? Between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., when post-fireworks traffic collides with fatigued or impaired driving. State Routes 35 and US-87/89 are particularly high-risk, with rural stretches and sparse law enforcement, which may potentially add to the danger.

Other states rounding out the top five deadliest include:

Mississippi, with a crash rate of 12.57, peaking between 3 and 4 p.m., likely tied to daytime travel and holiday gatherings.

North Dakota, at 12.44, with its riskiest hour between 9 and 10 p.m., especially on local roads like Burleigh Avenue West.

Wyoming, with 11.86 crashes per million, sees the highest risk during the early evening hours.

South Dakota, at 11.81, sees the most deadly crashes between 11 p.m. and midnight, particularly on Interstate 90 East.

Western states feature heavily among the most dangerous, highlighting a pattern of higher crash risks in rural, lower-density areas.

Across the nation, late evening consistently emerges as the most dangerous time to drive on July 4th. Between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., many drivers are returning from fireworks shows or heading home from parties, creating a risky mix of fatigue, impaired driving, and congested roads.

Local roads, not just big highways, see many of these tragedies. From small county roads in Mississippi to main streets in North Dakota, the study shows you don’t have to be on the interstate to face deadly consequences.

The study also highlighted where you’re least likely to experience a fatal crash on the 4th of July. Hawaii ranked as the safest state, with acrash rateof just 1.38 per million residents, 81% below the national average. Shorter travel distances, lower speed limits, and less road-tripping likely play a role in keeping fatal crashes down.

Other safer states include:

Rhode Island, with a rate of 1.78 per million

Massachusetts, at 2.36 per million

West Virginia, at 3.39 per million

New Jersey, at 3.53 per million

Many of these states have strong seatbelt laws, a robust police presence, or dense road networks with lower average speeds, which help minimize severe crashes.

While Montana tops the list, other states with high fatal crash rates on Independence Day include South Carolina, Kentucky, and Delaware. On the opposite end, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington also appear among the safest.

Key risk factors the study highlighted include:

The hour of the day, with crashes often spiking after dark

Rural roads, which can leave crash victims far from emergency help

Alcohol and speed, consistently cited as major contributors

The analysis examined fatal crash rates per million residents on July 4th from 2019 to 2023 using NHTSA data. Researchers ranked each state based on its five-year fatal crash rate, and also highlighted the highest-risk hour of the day and the roads most frequently involved in these deadly collisions.

If you’re planning to celebrate with fireworks and festivities, plan ahead:Avoid driving late at night if possible

Designate a sober driver

Watch your speed, even on familiar local roads

Expect heavy traffic and stay patient

The 4th of July should be a day for celebration, not tragedy. Being mindful of where and when you hit the road can help ensure you enjoy the holiday safely."

An undocumented immigrant accused of killing a Minneapolis woman while driving drunk has been deported and can no longer be held accountable in the fatal crash.

ICE officials confirmed to theStar Tribuneon Wednesday that German Llangari Inga, 35, has been deported to his native country, Ecuador. He was facing vehicular homicide and vehicular operationcharges in the death of Victoria Harwell, 31, of Minneapolis.

Last August, Llangari Inga was accused of crashing head-on into a car being driven by Harwell, who later died at a hospital. One of Harwell's eight children, a 14-year-old girl, also was in the car but didn't sustain life-threatening injuries in the crash.

Police reportedly found open beer bottles in Llangari Inga’s car and his blood alcohol content (BAC) was more than twice the legal limit.

Because of the deportation, Llangari Inga’s criminal case in Hennepin County won’t move forward.

In a statement provided toBring Me The News, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty says the resulting harm from Llangari Inga’s deportation was entirely “foreseeable and preventable.”

“The federal government’s dangerous, mindless commitment to deporting people who should be held accountable in the communities they harmed is devastating to victims and their loved ones,” Moriarty said in an emailed statement.

Llangari Inga’s case and the events that followed have been viewed as controversial by some, with the Trump administration highlighting it as an example of Twin Cities officials' handling of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes.

Llangari Inga was the subject of a 2016 ICE order for expedited removal from the U.S.  at the time of his arrest last year. ICE claims that the Sheriff's Office failed to honor the detainer and released him a few days after the fatal crash without alerting the agency.

When he was formally charged and arrested again this May, Llangari Inga was released days later on bond for a second time, despite the retainer.

Llangari Inga was then arrested by ICE agents. He had been in ICE custody from May 16 until his deportation on June 24.

“ICE has flown him to his home country where he will not be detained, stripping away any possibility of justice for the people traumatized by his actions,” Moriarty said.

The victim’s father, Victor Hardwell, told theStar Tribunethat he was disappointed in the decision but not surprised, and that he got a “heads up” from the County Attorney’s Office.

A warrant was issued for Llangari Inga's arrest following his deportation, but it's unlikely that he will ever return to court in Hennepin County.

The crash occurred at Cross Keys Airport in Gloucester County, about 21 miles southeast of Philadelphia. According to theFederal Aviation Administration, the aircraft involved was a Cessna 208B carrying 15 people. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.

Aerial images from the scene show the small aircraft surrounded by trees, its body broken and debris scattered nearby, according toNBC News. Emergency vehicles, including fire trucks and ambulances, lined the surrounding area as first responders worked quickly to assess the damage and care for the injured.

Cooper University Hospital in Camden received all 15 crash victims. Three people were sent to its trauma center, and eight others with less severe injuries were treated in the emergency department. Another four patients, all with what hospital officials described as “minimal injuries,” were still awaiting evaluation.

Hospital EMS crews and trauma specialists were deployed directly to the crash site, according to Cooper spokesperson Wendy A. Marano.

Cross Keys Airport declined to comment on the situation and referred questions to Skydive Cross Keys, the commercial skydiving company operating at the airport. As of Wednesday night, Skydive Cross Keys had not responded to requests for comment.

Gloucester County Emergency Management asked residents to steer clear of the area to allow emergency responders full access.

As federal investigators begin piecing together what went wrong, questions remain about how a plane meant to lift passengers into the sky ended up breaking through the forest instead.

The agency began investigating the case on Jan. 6.

Creech, 50, is facing one count of assault with threat of bodily injury and one count of aggravated assault for strangulation.

TBI said Creech turned himself in and was booked in the Cheatham County jail on $6,000 bond. The Cheatham County Jail said Creech was no longer in the jail as of July 3.

He is no longer employed by the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office.

THP said a trooper pulled over a 63-year-old woman for a suspected hands-free driving violation around 11 a.m.

After a brief stop near the railroad tracks at Bartlett Boulevard and Stage Road, the trooper issued a verbal warning and walked away, releasing the vehicle.

At that point a passing CSX train passed by, clipping the rear of the woman’s SUV. The trooper aided the woman until paramedics arrived. The driver’s injuries were not life-threatening, THP said.

Those details roughly match a narrative given by a witness at the scene Wednesday, though THP did not confirm the traffic stop until Thursday.

“I saw him walk back to his car, and on the way back the train blew a horn and you can see it coming and he like, signaled like, go, go, go,” said witness Jordan Pearce.

According to Pearce, there seemed to be confusion as the woman tried to get out of harm’s way.

He says at first it seemed she had trouble backing up, but then she crept back forward onto the tracks and stopped.

SPANISH FORK, Utah (ABC4) — A man living in Spanish Fork has been arrested following thedeath of a motorcycle driverin a crash yesterday afternoon.

Rafael Alvis, 55, has been arrested and is facing possible charges of criminal negligence automobile homicide, and driving under the influence.

PREVIOUSLY: Motorcycle driver dies after crash involving truck in Spanish Fork

According to documents, the officer who responded to the scene of the fatal motorcycle crash in Spanish Fork on July 2 arrived right before the motorcycle driver, who was in his 60s, was pronounced deceased.

The officer made contact with the driver of the Chevrolet truck that was involved in the crash. While speaking with Alvis, he allegedly told the officer that he struck the motorcycle while passing through the intersection, believing that he had a green light.

Alvis reportedly said that he pulled over to the shoulder and went back to see the victim. The officer at the scene said that Alvis had the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his person and breath, according to documents.

A person who witnessed the crash told police that they were waiting at the red light when they saw the Chevrolet truck approaching. They said that the driver allegedly appeared to be on his phone, holding it above the steering wheel. The witness then saw the motorcycle enter the intersection and collide with the truck.

Several drug tests were performed on Alvis. A breath sample was collected just before 5 p.m., over an hour after the crash, and came back as 0.008%. A urine test returned negative. A Drug Recognition Expert conducted a test and told police that they believed Alvis was under the influence of a depressant and an inhalant.

Due to the witness’s account of Alvis being on his phone at the time of the crash and the belief that he was under the influence, Alvis was arrested and is being held without bail for the death of the motorcycle driver.

This was the third fatal crash involving a motorcycle in Utah this week. The other crashes both involved 23-year-old victims. One occurred inAmerican Forkand the other inWest Valley City.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/landgraf-says-302-reconfigured-amid-185859673.html,2025-07-03 22:00:00,Landgraf says 302 will be reconfigured amid rise in deadly crashes,"ECTOR COUNTY, Texas (KMID/KPEJ)- State representative Brooks Landgraf said change is on the way for a deadly intersection between Odessa and Kermit.

“Two fatal crashes in two days at the same intersection is unacceptable,” Landgraf said in a statement. “The point where SH 302…crosses FM 181 must change, given the nature of the traffic in this part of the oilfield. I’ve been in touch this morning with our excellent TxDOT district engineer, who is very aware of the intersection and its deadly problems.”

Earlier this week,56-year-old Ricky Dale Shaw, of Odessa, was killed when the driver of a semi-truck failed to stop at a stop sign, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a crash report. A day earlier, investigators said56-year-old Christopher Eric Wilke, of Frisco, was killed when another truck driver failed to yield the right of way at the intersection.

Landgraf said the Texas Department of Transportation has plans to reconfigure the intersection of SH 301 and FM 181 to make it safer for all.

“Designing is underway, construction will begin soon, with scheduled completion in 2026,” Landgraf said.

The intersection at SH 302 and FM 181 in Ector County is currently a two-way stop with eight traffic conflict points. Landgraf said TxDOT’s reconfiguration plan will change it to an “RCUT” intersection, which will make it impossible for sand haulers and other vehicles to run stop signs that cause deadly crashes. RCUT stands a for “Restricted Crossing U-Turn” intersection. The design modifies how drivers turn and cross at a highway from smaller, intersecting roads.

“RCUTs are a quick and effective way to improve safety by significantly reducing traffic conflict points…have been used successfully in recent years in other parts of the state that feature high volumes of heavy commercial traffic,” Landgraf added.

TxDOT will also reconfigure in the same way the intersections of SH 302 at FM 1936 and SH 301 at FM 866.

“Of course, all of these crashes can be prevented by drivers being more careful, paying attention and following the rules of the road. I know that’s all easier said than done, but driver responsibility is the most important aspect of road safety. My heart goes out to the loved ones of the drivers whose lives have been lost this week, and I’m keeping them in my prayers,” said Landgraf.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-takes-aim-rainbow-212800159.html,2025-07-03 22:00:00,Trump administration takes aim at rainbow crosswalks like at Pulse nightclub site,"ORLANDO, Fla. — The Trump administration is seeking to wipe rainbows and other “political banners” from streets and crosswalks across the nation, a move that puts at risk the multi-colored crossing near the former Pulse nightclub in Orlando.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a letter to the nation’s governors this week introducing a “safety initiative” seeking consistent markings on roads. On a post on X the same day, he more clearly spelled out his intentions.

“Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks,” he posted. “Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”

A rainbow crosswalk has been emblazoned on Orange Avenue at West Esther Street since 2017. It’s at the southern boundary of Pulse, the nightclub once seen as a safe haven for the LGBTQ community and where 49 were killed and 53 were wounded in a mass shooting on June 12, 2016.

Duffy’s letter itself doesn’t mention rainbows or “political banners” specifically, but states the agency’s desire to partner with state and local governments to “make the entire roadway right-of-way easier to interpret and navigate for all users.” It cites 39,345 traffic fatalities last year as “unacceptable,” though that marks a 3.8% decrease from the year prior.

City Commissioner Patty Sheehan, Central Florida’s first openly gay elected official, said she wasn’t surprised that the crosswalks and others like it were in danger. But she noted the rainbow crosswalk is part of the design for the memorial to the nightclub shooting, which received state funding in the budget signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this week.

“I think they’re trying to undo anything that celebrates marginalized people, and that’s just terrible,” Sheehan said. “That rainbow crosswalk is also part of the Pulse memorial and the state just gave us $400,000 toward the memorial, so I would hope they wouldn’t do something that would be detrimental to that memorial.”

On Wednesday, city officials received a separate memo — though dated a day prior to Duffy’s — from the Florida Department of Transportation, noting that surface markings must “serve a functional, safety-related purpose,” and that the department’s design manual “explicitly prohibits the application of pavement or surface art on travel lanes, paved shoulders, intersections, crosswalks or sidewalks.”

The manual specifically notes that pavement art associated with social, political or ideological messages is banned, and that the state can withhold funding from any agency not in compliance, according to the state’s letter.

But such markings can stay on the road with permission from the state “if the public agency is able to demonstrate good cause for doing so,” the memo reads.

In recent years, Orlando transportation officials have painted at least five major downtown crosswalks with artistic murals, which they say waspart of their planto increase visibility of crosswalks and hopefully improve safety for people crossing.

At the time, theycited research from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which found a 50% dip in crash rates involving pedestrians and a 37% drop in crashes involving pedestrians at intersections that have asphalt art. Drivers also yielded to pedestrians 27% more often at such intersections, the group’s research showed.

While those murals depict the Lake Eola fountain, orange slices, Lake Eola’s famous swans and other apolitical art, they seem to run afoul with the state’s directive.

City officials hadn’t received the federal letter and are reviewing the state’s directives, a spokesperson said.

The muralswere announced in 2023, which also marked the paving over of a 400-foot Black Lives Matter mural along Rosalind Avenue, painted in the colors of the Pan-African flag.

It was first painted in June 2020 by city officials and community members after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which spawned nationwide protests against systemic racism and police brutality, including in Orlando. The mural was ultimately covered up as part of repaving the street three years later.

The new FDOT memo on street surfaces comes after itadopted a policy in Februaryto limit lighting on state-managed bridges to “a default scheme of red, white and blue,” preventing previous designs such as the rainbow colors on Lake Underhill Bridge on State Road 408 in Orlando in the weeks after Pulse in 2016 and on other state bridges in the years afterward.

One of them said he observed a nose-up attitude during takeoff, meaning the front of the plane was higher than the tail which can be dangerous. The other witness told NTSB he didn’t hear any strange engine noises or see smoke or fire coming from the plane while it was in flight.

According to NTSB, the pilot had recently bought the four-seat airplane to fly it back to his home base at Buckingham Field Airport in Fort Myers, Florida. A special flight permit was signed so it could be flown from Westwinds Airport in Delta back to Fort Myers.

On the day of the crash, the pilot flew the plane from the Delta airport to Montrose Regional Airport, where it was fueled.

The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Montrose. The left wing of the airplane struck an elevated dirt driveway before coming to rest behind a home, according to NTSB’s report. A fire then started, which destroyed the craft.

NTSB investigators determined the airplane was built from a kit in 2008.

The pilot – who along with the passenger, has yet to be publicly identified – held ratings for airplane single engine land and sea, according to NTSB.

The passenger had ratings for airplane, single and multi-engine land, as well as commercial pilot privileges for single-engine sea. He was an active commercial airline pilot with type ratings for the Boeing 757 and 767 series and the Douglas DC-8 series. He also held a flight instructor certificate and airframe and powerplant mechanic certificates, the report stated.

It’s what most kids playing video games ask their parents, but also what Kevin Reitmeier’s family wishes they had with him.

“I’d give anything for five more minutes with my nephew,” Jameel Marshall said Thursday.

At a growing memorial forReitmeier, who died in a motorized scooter crashTuesday, his family remembered the teen and also called for more safety at the West Side intersection.

Reitmeier was going into his freshman year at St. Paul’s Humboldt High School. “He loved life, was very energetic, loved his family and friends, loved God,” said aunt Reese Marshall.

He was adventurous and enjoyed being in nature. He had told his mother he wanted to live in the woods when he grew up, said grandmother Angela Tucker.

On Tuesday at about 8:50 a.m., police Reitmeier was operating a gasoline-powdered scooter. A 13-year-old, who Reitmeier’s family said was a friend of his, was the passenger. The scooter struck the front of a pickup truck at Ohio and George streets, police have said.

Preliminary information indicated the scooter was being operated in the street, ran a stop sign before the crash, and that neither of the teens wore helmets, police have said.

Police have said the pickup driver did not show signs of impairment and is cooperating with the investigation.

Reitmeier, who lived in the area, was pronounced dead at the hospital. His 13-year-old friend was in critical but stable condition as of Wednesday morning, according to police.

The intersection is controlled by stop signs at all four corners. Grandmother Stacy Schminkey said there’s a problem with people not stopping at the intersection “and this should have been addressed.”

“I’ve seen the comments online and … they’re blaming” Reitmeier, Schminkey said. “… Don’t put the blame on him when you have grown people who are licensed, passed the test, and they’re not stopping. Then, you’ve got a kid and what’s he going to do? Follow the example of what everyone else is doing.”

When the family starts to heal, Schminkey said she’s wants to push for traffic lights at the intersection.

The city has already been intending to resurface George Street this year, according to the Public Works Department. The plan does not call for traffic lights at George and Ohio streets, though pedestrian and crossing improvements are intended for the intersection.

“Bumpouts (or curb extensions) will be added on the south side of the street to improve visibility of people crossing George Street, reduce the crossing distance for people walking, and slow drivers by narrowing the street. There will also be bumpouts into Ohio where possible,” according to aPublic Works website.

Handwritten notes to Reitmeier have been left at his memorial: “I wish this day wasn’t true,” one said. “Hug your dad extra tight for us,” said another note (Reitmeier’s father died in 2018).

At Reitmeier’s memorial, in addition to the gaming references, there are stuffed animals and balloons in his favorite color of green, flowers and plants because he enjoyed gardening with his mother and picking flowers for her, a Bible for his faith, and his favorite soda and chips — root beer and Funyuns.

Reitmeier was “fearless,” said uncle Jameel Marshall. “He never let anything stop him from achieving a goal.”

He loved fireworks — “the kid was a firework himself” — and he enjoyed the Fourth of July, Marshall said.

“Kevin was the light of all our worlds,” his uncle said."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-officers-attend-dui-training-222805474.html,2025-07-04 01:00:00,Local police attend DUI training before big holiday weekend,"DUNCANSVILLE, Pa. (WTAJ)– Police officers from multiple departments in Blair County attended a DUI training Thursday afternoon to brush up on their procedures before the holiday weekend.

The training was held at the National Guard Readiness Center in Duncansville. There, instructors with the Pennsylvania DUI Association gave a presentation on why it is so critical that officers get impaired drivers off of roads.

“People have too much to drink or people use drugs and drive and the holidays sometimes exacerbate that because there is an extra day off,” Instructor Jim Gregg said.

AG Sunday urges firework safety ahead of July 4th holiday weekend

Gregg said that their message is simple, drive sober or get pulled over. For him, it’s an issue that hits close to home.

“I’m a retired trooper, and as a young trooper, I was involved in a pursuit with a drunk driver where I almost lost my life in a very violent crash,” Gregg said. “Ever since then, I’ve had a personal commitment to impaired driving enforcement.”

During the presentation, Gregg told officers not to feel bad when issuing a DUI, because it could save the driver or some else’s life. After, officers go through mock traffic stops where they run through how to properly conduct a field sobriety test. Maggie Nunley, the Regional DUI Program Administrator with the PA DUI Association, said that drivers can do their part to make sure that stops go safely as well by simply indicating to officers that they are pulling over.

“That can be done by putting your four ways on, putting your turn signal on because a lot of people have this idea of well, what if I want to stop for the police but I’m looking for a place that I feel comfortable stopping,” Nunley said.

“There’s too many platforms like Uber, having a designated driver and things of that nature,” Gregg said. “But for those people that do drink and drive, you run the risk of running into one of these talented men or women and they will be conducting field sobriety tests in Blair County.”

The video shows a Moraine cruiser on Ohio 741 near the Fuyao Glass facility encounter the truck, which had been reported stolen from Riverside.

The cruiser deploys a StarChase GPS tracking device, sticking the device to the back of the truck before it speeds away, running through a red light. The officer backs off but continues to follow the truck from a distance, the video shows.

Police previously said they used the tracking device to follow the truck to an abandoned parking lot on N. Dixie Drive near Wagner Ford Road.

Dash camera footage shows officers catch back up to the truck as it drives through the parking lot of Dayton Village Pizza.

Police previously said that the truck rammed an unmarked police vehicle when fleeing, but the collision was not visible on camera footage.

The video then shows the truck go around signs and barrels up the ramp from Wagner Ford Road to southbound I-75, which is currently closed due to construction, followed by multiple cruisers. Officers continue to follow the truck south on I-75 in the lanes closed for construction until the lanes rejoin the highway.

The video ends around the exit to Ohio 48/Main Street.

The pursuit would end miles further south, after stop sticks were deployed by the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, deflating at least two of its tires, before it finally veered off the highway near the 46 mile marker south of the Dixie Drive/West Carrollton exit.

The driver bailed out of the U-Haul and fled on foot, leaving behind a man and a woman in the truck who were arrested on unrelated warrants, police said.

In a press conference Thursday, Moraine police identified the driver of the U-Haul and said that the Montgomery County Prosecutor's Office approved charges of felonious assault, failure to comply/fleeing and eluding, theft of a motor vehicle, vandalism and breaking and entering.

The couple’s daughter, Landry Johnson, said her four-month-old son, who was in the vehicle when the crash happened, is now out of the hospital and healthy.

“Tell your family that you love them, that you care,” said Johnson. “Tell the people that you love how much they mean to you. That’s what I’m taking away from this.”

Johnson told Ozarks First she remembers seeing her parents five minutes before the crash.

“I remember the last conversation that we had,” said Johnson. “I told them that I loved them because I did that every time I left. I remember the last time I looked at my child before he was in the wreck. I remember all of those little moments. I remember seeing her carpool away, and I also remember seeing the cop car that was going to the wreck, driving to it at that time not knowing that that was where he was going.”

Johnson said the community surrounding her parents is hurting. She said even those who didn’t know them well have been hit by the loss.

“The sheriff’s department, they are hurting so bad,” said Johnson. “That was one of their officers. Off duty or on duty, it didn’t matter. When they figured out who it was in that vehicle, their lives were changed forever.”

Zachary Bell use to work with Mike Adams at the Christian County Sheriff’s office and is a friend of the family. He told Ozarks First Mike Adams was like a father to him.

“He was always someone I looked up to, even after I left the sheriff’s office,” said Bell. “He was still someone that inspired me and they always will inspire me.”

Bell said the tragedy has impacted the community as a whole.

“There are so many people that that know the name Adams and it has hit them hard,” said Bell. “It’s a tragedy for the whole community and it was just a shock.”

Johnson and Bell told Ozarks First about the kind of people the Adams were and the lives they lived.

“They were they were great people always willing to give a helping hand to whoever they need,” said Bell. “They could go into a gas station, and they’d come out with a new friend. They were just those kinds of people. They were always willing to help you and always there to talk. They never met a stranger.”

“They were perfect for each other,” said Johnson. “I don’t think my mom or Mike, either one, could’ve had a better match for one another. They shared the same goals, the same aspirations.”

Johnson remembers her mom and stepdad as the perfect couple as well as her best friends.

“Mike came into my life when I was quite young, and he was great. I wouldn’t have traded him for anything in the entire world,” said Johnson. “He was everything that I wanted my mom to have in her life.”

Johnson said Mike loved his job as a Christian County Deputy and loved to serve others.

“It was his passion,” said Johnson. “He wanted to help the community, he wanted to be the person that kept the street safe, to be there for when somebody needed him, even in the worst circumstances.”

“From my time working with him, he never he was never disrespectful. He always tried to make it as pleasant as possible,” said Bell. “He took he took the job as being a sheriff’s deputy very serious and took part in serving the community very serious.”

As for Ashley, Johnson said everyone knew her as a light.

“She had a witty personality,” said Johnson. “She could crack a joke in no time she would light up every room she walked into you. You could be having the worst day and the second and my mom popped a joke; your day was no longer ruined.”

Bell said so many have been supportive to those who were close to the Adams.

“There’s been an outpouring of support, just from everybody and from so many departments,” said Bell.

“I know that justice will be served no matter what and my mom and Mike deserve that more than anything,” said Johnson.

The suspect was identified as Francis Guadalupe Tercero-Benavides, 24, of Anaheim, according to the Irvine Police Department.

On May 9, 2024,the victim, Allen Yangkaou Lee, 67, was driving northbound on Culver Drive towards Trabuco Road in Irvine at around 4:30 p.m.

As he passed an intersection, dash cam video captured the suspect’s vehicle jutting out and making a right turn against a red light. The sudden movement forced Allen to swerve so he would avoid crashing into her.

The swerve caused Allen to lose control of his car before it flipped over. His vehicle collided with a center median, a tree and a light pole before landing on its roof.

Tercero-Benavides, who was driving a beige Honda Civic, did not stop to help Lee and fled the scene. Paramedics rushed Lee to the hospital where he died from his injuries on May 13.

As detectives continued searching for Tercero-Benavides, two days later, they received tips from the public that helped locate her Honda Civic parked on a residential street in Great Park.

Inside the car, identification documents belonging to Tercero-Benavides were found. Detectives worked to locate the woman, but the task proved difficult as she reportedly moved around frequently.

On July 3, 2025, she was located and arrested in the 1600 block of Anaheim Boulevard in Anaheim. She was booked at the Orange County Jail for vehicular manslaughter and felony hit-and-run charges.

“The Irvine Police Department thanks those who provided critical tips that helped lead to the arrest of Tercero-Benavides,” department officials said.

Family members described Lee as a loving father and grandfather who always brought joy to those in his life.

“He was such a generous and very caring man,” said Elaine Lee, the victim’s daughter. “He was everything. It was so sudden and it really does feel like there is a hole. He was ripped from our lives unfairly.”

Traffic from northbound I-15 wasn’t affected during the closure because the flyover ramp enters I-11 just beyond the site of the crash.

An alert posted by the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) of Southern Nevada showed a vehicle on its top, sticking out partially into the flow of traffic.

The pilot was able to walk away from the plane and was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, according to the Hawaii County Fire Department.

HFD said firefighters were dispatched shortly after 7 a.m. to a report of a crash landing north of the Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport. A mayday call had come into the tower, and shortly after, all communications were lost due to the aircraft losing power.

The pilot—the plane’s sole occupant – had attempted to land on Kekaha Kai State Beach Park Access Road at Mahaiula Beach.

HFD said he was treated and taken to Kona Community Hospital with minor injuries.

Kekaha Kai State Beach Park Access Road will remain closed for most, or possibly the rest, of the day, HFD said, until the plane can be removed.

State officials said KOA’s Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF ) unit also responded.

HFD listed engine problems as the cause of the crash landing.

The Federal Aviation Administration said, based on preliminary information, a Cessna 182G crashed at about 6 :55 a.m. near the airport. The FAA will investigate.

Nolan Harmon is having a hard time keeping his frustration under control after a driver hit his partner, Tyler Mayhugh, and kept going.

“Even if you didn’t see it that night, the next day, you’d see your car had been hit. You’d wonder what happened. To see news reports and to just totally ignore it … That’s horrible,” Harmon said.

Greensboro police say that around 3 a.m. on Sunday, Mayhugh was walking along West Gate City Boulevard near the intersection of Mackay Road.

His sister, Shila Mayhugh, said that’s not the full story.

“His friend that he was with says that he had dropped his vape out of the window … She did the U-turn because he wanted to get his vape … He was getting out because he wanted to go get it, and a car just came out of nowhere and just struck him,” Shila said.

Shila said her brother is still in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.

“His legs. They’re completely broken. They’re shattered. His femur was shattered … He has nails and rods in all of his legs and his ankles,” Shila said.

As Mayhugh continues to fight for his life, his sister is asking the driver responsible for the crash to go to the police.

“So we can get justice for him. It wasn’t just a hit. He’s still fighting for his life,” Shila said

Greensboro police say they’re investigating the crash as a felony hit-and-run.

According to a July 1 release from Sugarcreek Borough police, officers were called to the scene of that crash in the 1200 block of Rocky Grove Ave around 9:18 on June 24, with both vehicles suffering heavy damage.

The first car, a Chevy pickup truck, was found in a nearby ditch near the road with the driver suffering undisclosed injuries and had to be led to the other car, a Subaru, further down the road by a witness.

When they found the Subaru driver suffering from multiple serious injuries walking away from the crash up the embankment, police said he initially gave them a fake name and that someone else was driving, which they said was not the case.

Following an independent investigation, Sugarcreek police said the Subaru driver, identified as 29-year-old Jared Hancher of Franklin, stole the car and someone else’s wallet to go with other property, using it to buy alcohol.

At the time of the crash, Hancher was allegedly driving near 70 mph and failed to make the turn into the 1200 block of Rock Grove Ave., causing them to strike the oncoming Chevy.

A warrant has since been issued for Hancher on charges of felony theft by unlawful taking, identity theft and access device fraud, to go with misdemeanor driving under the influence, false reports and identification to law enforcement, along with misdemeanor driving offenses.

An unruly people would weaken the centre, extract concessions and push tensions until they became contradictions. From there, you get the real prospect of regime change.

Britain remains a relatively prosperous and secure nation. But it is becoming palpably less governable by the day. This is not confined to one party or leader. The lifespan of prime ministers and their cabinets are getting shorter. Parliament is sovereign once again, but it does not feel that way. Successive governments have failed to grip the centre and act decisively to overcome Britain’s malaise.This is the task that falls to Labour.

These are not easy times in which to govern. The Government has little room for manoeuvre. The bond markets are tetchy, gilt yields are higher than they have been for decades, pushing up the cost of borrowing. The failure of the leadership to shave £5 billion off welfare spending only increases the nervousness. Scleroticism has taken hold in seemingly every institution. How have we got here? And how can Labour get us out of it?

From the 1990s through to 2016, the political class on both Left and Right was characterised above all by complacency. These were the fat years. Growth was good, largely because of a booming services economy centred on London and the south east in general and the City of London in particular.This growth enabled New Labour’s economics of redistributionthat supported the country’s heartlands. After years of hardship, Blair’s model seemed to finally bring the warring factions of the country back together again.

The 2008 crash should have shaken the political class out of its complacency, exposing the precarity of our heavily financialised economy and the malaise that lurked beneath the surface of our now fragile economic model. While services had grown, our productive capacity had been denuded. Strategic industries had been closed down, outsourced or sold o&fflig; to foreign investors. Regions once massaged by public sector employment opportunities and welfare found these tools were no longer powerful enough to smooththe cracks left by deindustrialisation.

The recession marked the juncture at which Britain began to decline relative to the US and most other European nations, yet it prompted little critical reflection. Austerity was the coalition government’s answer – and it was an expensive one. Huge structural weaknesses in our economy were reduced to a matter of simple accounting. Investment dried up and infrastructure could not keep pace with maddeningly high levels of immigration. Growth, productivity and real wages flatlined. Complacency was still the order of the day for a political class who had grown decadent and far-removed from the real conditions of the country.

Whatever else it may have done, the vote to leave the European Union punctured this complacency.Blue Labour had been warning since 2009 that all was not well in the body politic, that lurking beneath the glitzy New Labour veneer social disa&fflig;ection was growing. Blue represented melancholia as much as conservatism. Now all was out in the open: the disconnect between the political class and the country it sought to govern; the towns that had been left behind, their economic purpose in a global economy obscure; and the dysfunction of government, parliament and our public institutions.

The Conservatives proved incapable of exiting this quagmire. The 2019 government began with an 80-seat majority and ended in ignominy and an announcement of a new fund for chess players. Lacking the will or confidence to take on Treasury orthodoxy, immigration trebled and levelling up was abandoned. The civil service was left unreformed. Growth continued to stagnate as judicial overreach and regulatory constraints made building impossible. A few brief spasms aside, inertia replaced complacency as the defining feature of our political class.

As little as a year ago, you could still find echoes of complacency in the political and media class when they spoke of Labour’s election win as a victory for the “grown-ups”. But fixing a broken political system, a dysfunctional state and a stagnant economy requires more than a clean suit and tie. It has taken Labour one year to discover what took the Conservatives 14 years: that Britain, its economy and its institutions, are barely functioning.

Too many in Labour defined themselves solely in opposition to the Conservatives and thought a new Government need only focus on “delivery”, with a few technical fixes here and there. Others wanted to reduce the task of governance to a form of altruism for those in need. Their vibes-based politics has no resonance in the country, no acknowledgment of the hard reality of trade-o&fflig;s in a low growth economy, and no solutions for Britain’s malaise. If there is a divide in Labour it is not between Left and Right, New Labour or Blue Labour, but between those who understand the severity of the country’s situation and those who do not.

The future success of this Government depends on this understanding. It must be an insurgent on behalf of the people, willing to grip the centre and take on its own party and the scleroticism of our institutions as it rebuilds a shattered country, shifting resources to the productive economy, to build, make and grow, driving social and economic development, radically reducing immigration and speaking for the whole country as one people united in a shared national identity and purpose.

This is the choice facing Labour, the fork in the road in this inauspicious moment – a retreat into the comfort zone of liberal progressivism confined to the prosperous areas of the country, doing things for a client electorate, promising the impossible, or a striving for a radical rebuilding of the national economy, renewing our sovereign democracy andbuilding our national revival on a broad, cross-class coalition. This way lies a second term and a new political settlement. The first year has not gone well, but there will be no second chance for Labour.

Some hugged and wept before entering the Capela da Ressurreição São Cosme. The brothers’ parents attended, as well as Jota’s agent, Jorge Mendes. Mourners left flowers and candles next to a tree outside the chapel were visitation was held.

Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also visited to pay his respects.

The chapel sits next to the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar church where the funeral for the siblings is planned for Saturday.

Gondomar resident Ricardo Alves lamented the loss of the local star as he passed by.

“It is a great sadness. Although I did not know him personally he was from here and I knew many of his friends from the region where he lived,"" Alves said. ""It is a great loss, he is a young man, with a lot still to give and he had a somewhat tragic fate.”

Jota, 28, and his brother, André Silva, 25, were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed on an isolated stretch of highway just after midnight on Thursday and burst into flames.

Their bodies were repatriated to Portugal after being identified by the family, Spanish government officials said.

Jota and his parents both have homes in Gondomar, where he started his playing career as a child. Gondomar is a working-class town next to Porto, where Jota was born.

Jota’s death occurred two weeks after he married long-time partner Rute Cardoso while on vacation from a long season where he helped Liverpool win the Premier League. The couple had three children, the youngest born last year.

Spanish police are investigating the cause of the crash, which did not involve another vehicle, they said. They said they believe it could have been caused by a blown tire.

Jota's brother Silva played for Portuguese club Penafiel in the lower divisions.

The loss was felt sharply in his hometown, especially at his first soccer club, where Jota started playing at age 9.

“He never forgot his roots, nor his friends, because he had a group of friends who were with him in the training here in Gondomar and who he even invited from time to time to go and watch Liverpool games in England,"" Gondomar SC director Anselmo Serra told The Associated Press. “They were like a group of friends that he never forgot over the years.”

Heading to England via boat

Jota and his brother were driving overnight to catch a boat from Santander, on Spain’s northern coast, to go to England to rejoin Liverpool, when they crashed, according to Portuguese media.

Portuguese sports website Record published a video interview with Miguel Gonçalves, who said he worked as a physical therapist for Jota. Gonçalves told Record that Jota was avoiding flying due to a lung condition that he recently treated.

“I was in his house at night for a last treatment,” Gonçalves said. “He was proud to have recovered from his pulmonary problem. He was happy to be with his brother. They were excited to spend some time together on the trip.”

Spanish police have yet to say which brother was driving.

Liverpool mourns Jota

Condolences poured infrom Portuguese officials and the world of soccer as news of the accident spread.

A moment of silence was held before Portugal played Spain at the Women’s European Championship in Switzerland late Thursday.

For a second day, Liverpool fans laid flowers and scarves outside Anfield Stadium. Former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson was among those to place a bouquet at the impromptu memorial to Jota.

Liverpool's players are not due back from their summer break until Monday.

Mohamed Salah wrote on social media that it will be hard to return to the team without Jota.

“Teammates come and go but not like this. It’s going to be extremely difficult to accept that Diogo won’t be there when we go back,” Salah wrote. “My thoughts are with his wife, his children, and of course his parents who suddenly lost their children. Those close to Diogo and his brother Andre need all the support they can get. They will never be forgotten.”

Kettering Police and medics were dispatched just before 6:50 a.m. to the 4200 block of Marshall Road on reports of a vehicle into a building.

The homeowner, Bill Cheers, told News Center 7’s Mason Fletcher that he was sitting in his chair when he first heard “skid screeching.”

“And I got up because I figured somebody’s going to crash, and all of a sudden, sound like an explosion,” Cheers said.

As shown onNews Center 7 at 5:00, we obtained doorbell camera video from a neighbor. It shows the gray truck running off the road and smashing into a tree in Cheers’ yard.

A Kettering Police lieutenant confirmed to News Center 7 that the driver of the truck died at the scene.

Photos from the scene show a pickup truck sustained front-end and rear-end damage from the crash.

Cheers said he was initially sitting about 15 to 20 feet away from where the crash ended. He showed News Center 7 the damage in his dining room.

His dog was lying right under the window as he heard the tires skid down the road.

“There’s a dog lying there. She got tossed,” Cheers said. “She’s got a little cut on her leg, but she’s traumatized. So am I.”

Cheers said he thought the crash was a result of road rage, and so did several neighbors News Center 7 spoke to.

After the crash, the doorbell video shows a white truck shortly after turning left. News Center 7 noticed white paint scraped onto the driver’s door of the gray truck.

Kettering Police said they had to call out extra units to help piece together what this crash looked like as they continue their investigation.

“They can look at debris on the ground and figure out how it got there,” Officer Cynthia James, Public Information Officer for Kettering Police, said. “They can look at marks on the street or in the grass, and figure out how those got there.”

Police are asking anyone in the area of the crash with security or doorbell cameras to review their footage to see if they caught anything related to the crash.

They are also looking for two vehicles believed to bepossible witnessesto the crash. One is believed to be a 2019-2021 Toyota Rav 4 and the other is possibly a 2016-2020 Mitsubishi Outlander.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/grieving-ok-family-drunk-driving-111500416.html,2025-07-04 13:00:00,Grieving OK family: Drunk driving is not worth a life this holiday weekend,"OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — The family of a UCO student killed by a drunk driver nearly five years ago says getting behind the wheel after you’ve had anything to drink this holiday weekend shouldn’t even be on the table.

In October of 2020,19-year-old Marissa Murrow, a University of Central Oklahoma sophomore, was driving a 2014 Ford Focus southbound on the Kilpatrick when she was hit head-on byMalcolm Penney, who was traveling the wrong direction. Penney was sentenced to life in prison in 2022 for the deadly crash.

Families of Victims of Impaired Drivers share unique perspective with law enforcement

Troopers said Penney initially ran from the scene, but was caught shortly after. They also said they could smell alcohol on his breath.

“We can’t get over the grief that we feel because we love Marissa too much,” said Jeff Murrow, Marissa’s dad, during an interview with News 4 Thursday. “The love doesn’t go away, so the grief doesn’t go away.”

Murrow and his wife Kristy, have since created a non-profit that works with families and state legislators to address concerns about impaired drivers on the roads calledVictims of Impaired Drivers(VOID). Marissa’s story has also inspiredtougher laws in Oklahomato deter drunk driving. Murrow told News 4 the holiday season is when that message needs to be amplified the most, with roadways expected to be busy.

“When you make the wrong choice, it could cost you everything,” said Murrow. “It could cost you your life, or it could cost you the life of someone that you love very dearly in your family, if you’re lucky. The best case scenario is it might cost you a job, or it might cost you your car or your reputation.”

Murrow said he knows there are some people who won’t heed his words, who might think they’ve gotten behind the wheel of a car while drinking and didn’t have any problems before. He said it’s the wrong mentality for any driver to have.

“I know there are some who will probably continue to make that mistake, and one day it will catch up to them,” said Murrow. “I just encourage everyone to make a great decision this holiday weekend.”

It’s the same advice the Oklahoma Highway Patrol [OHP] is hoping drivers will consider, with enforcement over the holiday weekend expected to be busy.

“We hope they make smart, reasonable, responsible decisions,” said Lieutenant Mark Southall, OHP Public Information Officer. “What people don’t see when they read these headlines of a fatality crash is they don’t see the knock that has to happen at the door when a trooper has to go tell someone’s loved one that they’re not coming home that night, They’re not dealing with the carnage at the scene that we deal with every single day. So our mission, our goal is to get people to drive safer so we have less deaths on the highways of Oklahoma and we have less broken families.”

Rebecca Herrera, 34, of El Paso, was convicted by an Otero County jury on June 25 of vehicular homicide while driving while intoxicated in the death of Isaac Garcia, 21, New Mexico's 12th Judicial District Attorney Ryan Suggs announced in a news release.

The jury deliberated for about 10 minutes before reaching a verdict, the news release states. Herrera was remanded into custody to await sentencing. A sentencing date has not been set. She faces up to 18 years in prison.

Judge Stephen P. Ochoa presided over the trial in the 12th District Court in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Assistant District Attorneys Randy Summers and Taylor Weary prosecuted the case for the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

Herrera left a party in West El Paso about 1:40 a.m. March 5, 2023 ""when, due to her level of intoxication, she became disoriented and crossed into New Mexico,"" the news release states.

A witness called 911 to report a vehicle driving the wrong direction on U.S. 54 near the Otero County Prison Facility in Chaparral, New Mexico. Herrera was driving south in the northbound lanes, going about 99 mph in her car, the news release states.

Less than five minutes after the 911 call, an Otero County Sheriff’s Office deputy found a ""catastrophic head-on collision,"" the news release states.

Europe's slow military mobilization leaves it vulnerable to future conflicts.

Ukraine's drone success highlights the need for EU collaboration and innovation.

As the prospect of a renewed Russian threat looms over Europe's eastern flank, EU leaders are accepting that the continent is ill-prepared when it comes to the risk of future conflict.

Last week, Andrius Kubilius, the European commissioner for defence and space, called for a sweeping ramp-up of drone production, urging EU nations to produce millions of drones a year by 2030.

Ukraine delivered over 1.3 million drones to its military in 2024, highlighting the gap in Europe's preparedness.

""The fact that European nations need to urgently rearm, and to do so in a way that is relevant to the threat from Russia, is not a new discovery,"" Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, told Business Insider.

""What's alarming is that it's being presented as news,"" he said, adding that this suggests the realization that rearmament is vital ""still hasn't sunk in evenly across Europe.""

The war in Ukraine has demonstrated thetransformative nature of dronesin modern combat.

From cheap first-person view drones to advanced loitering munitions and AI-guided strike systems, the war has pioneered new forms of drone warfare, with Ukraine often outmatching Russian capabilities in speed and creativity.

Katja Bego, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said that ""Ukraine's remarkable success with drones has shown it is possible to rapidly ramp up production if the urgency is there. Europe is now learning these lessons.""

Currently, however, the EU is still far behind. Both Russia and Ukraine reportedly outproduce the entire EU bloc ""by orders of magnitude,"" Bego warned.

But it's clear that there is increasing interest from EU states to work with andimport Ukrainian expertise and systems.

""If European countries are serious about acquiring drones at the pace and scale that is being described, they must do so in and with Ukraine,"" Giles said.

The latest push for mass drone manufacturing in Europe isn't just about meeting current threats. It's about leapfrogging into the technologies that will define future conflict.

""Europe sees an opportunity to leapfrog,"" Bego said. ""Smaller drones are much cheaper than a lot of traditional weapons and can be produced much more quickly.""

However, making the most of this moment requires more than just factories.

""Getting to the scale of relevance for deterrence and defense is more than an issue of defense production,"" Skip Davis, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Business Insider.

""It's about the ability to field prototypes, train operators, revise operational concepts, and integrate drones into logistics and manoeuvre formations,"" he said. ""All of that requires a new mindset.""

That would involve deeper collaboration between militaries and agile, often non-traditional tech firms.

Davis said that in the current environment, ""many of the companies leading innovation are small startups or commercial companies not used to working with militaries.""

For Europe to succeed, he said it must grow more comfortable with experimentation and iteration.

Compounding the urgency is the decreasing estimate of when Russia could be ready to attack a NATO country.

The estimate of five years was what we were hearing this time last year, Giles said. ""Since then, the timescale has continued to shrink — and the reduction in US support to Ukraine brings the time closer.""

This shortening horizon makes the EU's slow progress all the more dangerous.

""Crash rearmament is feasible, if there is sufficient political will,"" Giles added.

At the same time, experts warn that ramping up drone output is not a silver bullet.

""Policymakers are at risk of seeing small agile drones as a panacea which will solve both their financial and manpower woes,"" Bego said. But ""there is still a need for large platforms like jet fighters, too,"" she added.

Meanwhile, Europe's vision of ""strategic autonomy"" in defense risks being undermined by its reliance on foreign tech.

""A lot of critical components in drone manufacturing are still produced in China,"" Bego said. ""Europe must diversify these supply chains or reproduce them within its own borders.""

With the clock ticking and Russian production accelerating, the EU's ambitious drone target looks ever more necessary, and could mark a pivotal moment in European defense.

""Policymakers are at risk of seeing small agile drones as a panacea which will solve both their financial and manpower woes,"" Bego said. But ""there is still a need for large platforms like jet fighters, too,"" she added.

Meanwhile, Europe's vision of ""strategic autonomy"" in defense risks being undermined by its reliance on foreign tech.

""A lot of critical components in drone manufacturing are still produced in China,"" Bego said. ""Europe must diversify these supply chains or reproduce them within its own borders.""

With the clock ticking and Russian production accelerating, the EU's ambitious drone target looks ever more necessary, and could mark a pivotal moment in European defense.

Private markets have the potential for great returns, and they havehistorically outperformedpublic ones. Many advisors steer clear of them, however, partially because of limited knowledge about how they actually work. It’s an information gap many will have to address sooner rather than later.

Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan believes that allocations to private equity and private credit will make up a third of client portfolios in the near future. “The vast majority of financial advisors may not go to private markets directly, [but] they will buy products that give them access to public and private markets,” he said during a Q&A at the Morningstar Investment Conference last week.

If advisors are to stay competitive in Rowan’s vision of the future, many are going to need a private markets crash course.

Right now, advisors allocate an average of just 5% of clients’ portfolios to alternatives, compared with 25% by institutions, according toFidelity. Part of the gap is due to limited access, since private markets are typically restricted toaccredited investors. But unfamiliarity also plays a big role. Private markets are complicated territory.

“You can’t just enter a ticker on a platform and execute transactions,” said Laura Lutton, head of manager research at Morningstar, adding that private market investments often require separate investment platforms and client agreements. “It creates a structural friction that keeps advisors reluctant to get involved,” she told Advisor Upside.

Private markets also come with lower liquidity, less transparency, and complex fee structures — challenges that can be difficult to explain to clients. “It sounds simple, but it’s really not,” Lutton said. Morningstar is working to make those conversations easier by expanding itsMedalist Ratingframework later this year to include semiliquid funds, offering more transparency and helping identify strategies likely to outperform certain benchmarks.

While, private markets may seem daunting, but advisors don’t have to go it alone:

One way advisors can become more familiar with private equity and private credit is through sponsors themselves. Major firms like BlackRock, KKR, iCapital and more offer CE credits through alternative investing courses.

The CFA Institute also offers multiple courses and certifications on private markets.

Do Your Homework.Some advisors are taking the independent study approach, like Alex Caswell of Wealth Script Advisors, who’s been reading books and scholarly articles published in the CFA Institute’s Financial Analysts Journal to understand whether the investments would be right for his clients. So far, he’s not sold on them, especially private credit.

“PC has swallowed up a lot of the fast-and-loose loan and debt origination that was done by banks pre-2008,” he told Advisor Upside. “Now, these PC funds are being shoved into portfolios left and right, and it comes with a lot of unevaluated risks that people aren’t realizing.”

It was the second hit-and-run in the five boroughs in 24 hours, cops said.

The victim was crossing near the Broadway Junction near the corner of Broadway and East New York Ave. in Ocean Hill at about 10 p.m. Thursday when a gray Ford rammed into him.

EMS rushed the victim toBrookdale University Hospital, where he died a short time later, cops said. His name was not immediately released.

The driver of the Ford sped off, never stopping, cops said. He remained at large on Saturday.

The Mustang was zipping east along E. 149th St. when the driver hit a pedestrian while trying to make a right turn onto Courtlandt Ave., cops said.

Veering out of control, the Mustang vaulted a curb and slammed into a scaffolding and five other pedestrians standing nearby, officials said.

The driver and his passenger crawled out of the mangled wreck and ran off on foot. The pair remained at large on Friday.

EMS took all of the pedestrians toLincoln Hospital, where they were treated for minor injuries, cops said.

Mother Marisol Ramos said she wants to search the explosion scene for her three missing sons, despite authorities warnings of potential dangers

“Let us do it,” a tearful Ramos toldToday

A mother who said her three children worked at theCalifornia fireworks facility that was the scene of an explosionis pleading with fire officials to let her help in the search for her loved ones.

Marisol Ramos recently toldTodayon Friday, July 4, that she has not heard from her three sons since the Tuesday, July 1, explosion in Esparto. Seven people were unaccounted for, according to officials.

Authorities said at the time they could not move forward with the search until the scene was safe due to the potential dangers.

Ramos, who immediately went over to the facility on the evening of the disaster, toldTodaythat she hasn’t received any answers since the incident.

“Let us do it,” a tearful Ramos said. “I’m willing to go in … I want to search for my kids.”

According to the family, the missing brothers are Jesus Ramos, 18, John Ramos, 22, and Joel ""Junior"" Melendez, 28, Fox affiliateKTVUreported.

Syanna Ruiz, the girlfriend of Jesus Ramos, told local outletKSBWthat Tuesday was her boyfriend's first day on the job at the facility.

The County of Yolo, where Esparto sits, said in anupdateon Thursday, July 3, that progress has been made in stabilizing the site and evacuation orders have been reduced in certain areas due to improved ground conditions and real-time risk assessments. It also said that utility crews are working to restore power to the affected areas.

“Field crews remain in the area to monitor evolving hazards and ensure public safety,” the county said in its update.

""Due to the presence of known explosive materials on site, explosive ordinance disposal experts are working alongside fire personnel to ensure safety during suppression activities,” the county’s update further stated.

Area residents recalled feeling and hearing Tuesday’s massive blast.

“Initially people thought it was a plane crash or something like that,” Yolo County librarian Diana Lopez toldThe Sacramento Bee.“Most of us didn’t know there was a fireworks facility so close by.”

“It felt like an earthquake,” Jairo Frausto, 14, told the newspaper.

The fireworks facility reportedly housed large pyrotechnics for aerial displays in Northern California, including for events scheduled for the July 4th holiday on Friday, perThe New York Times.

Jota's brother, André Silva, also a professional soccer player, was also killed in the wreck.

A source close to the sub-delegate of the Spanish government in Zamora revealed the crash is being investigated as “a possible speeding incident,"" according toCNN, citing the UK's PA News Agency.

The crash occurred around 12:30 a.m. local time in Zamora, a city in northwestern Spain.Mundo Americareportedthat the Lamborghini is expected to be a Huracán model, ""according to the only recognizable feature after the accident: the rims.""

Authorities told CNN the incident was caused by a “burst tire while overtaking."" The vehicle that Jota and his brother were in left the road and subsequently caught fire, officials said.

It is not known which brother was driving the Lamborghini that the brothers were traveling in.

""At this moment in time it is impossible to say at exactly what speed the car was going but that is something the Civil Guard investigators will be able to detail at least approximately in their final report from things like the skid marks,"" a spokesperson for the Civil Guard law enforcement agency, which is leading the investigation,told ABC News Australia.

Their remains were moved to the nearby town of Puebla de Sanabria, a source close to the sub-delegate of the Spanish government in Zamora told CNN.

A reportin the Portuguese-language siteRecordsaid Jota and his wife, Rute Cardoso, attended a friend's wedding over the weekend.

According toRecord, Jota and his brother were heading to Liverpool, ""following by car trip to Santander (Spain) from where he would follow by ferry to the south of England and then to Liverpool.""

Jota married his long-term partner, Cardoso, less than two weeks before the crash. The couple has three children.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/death-top-russian-oil-executive-193341198.html,2025-07-04 20:30:00,Death of top Russian oil executive fuels fresh scrutiny of elite's 'window falls',"The unexplained death of a topRussian oilexecutive on July 4 is fueling renewed scrutiny over the rising number of high-profile Russian officials and businessmen who have died under mysterious circumstances, specifically, have fallen out of windows.

Andrei Badalov, vice president of Transneft, Russia's largest state-controlled pipeline transport company,diedafter falling from the window of his apartment inMoscow.

Russian state news agency TASS, citing law enforcement sources, claimed the preliminary cause of death was suicide.

While Russian authorities often label these falls as suicides or accidents, others suggest something more deliberate may be at play.

Ivan Stupak, a Ukrainian military analyst and former security service (SBU) officer, said it's likely that Russia's own security services are behind many such deaths.

""They can pressure a person in one way or another. It's a well-known tactic — either you kill yourself, and your family is left in peace with what they have, or they start arrests, imprisonments, and leave everyone destitute,"" he told the Kyiv Independent.

Since early 2022, dozens ofRussian businessmen, state officials, and industry leaders have died under questionable circumstances.

While many of these cases have officially been labeled as suicides, others involve alleged murder-suicides, mysterious accidents, or unexplained falls.

In April 2022,Vladislav Avayev, vice president ofGazprombank, one of Russia's largest banks, was found dead in Moscow alongside his wife and daughter. Preliminary findings claimed Avaev shot them before turning the gun on himself.

Just days later, former Novatek gas producer executiveSergei Protosenya, his wife, and daughter were discovered dead at a villa in Spain.

Spanish mediareportedthat Protosenya allegedly killed his family and then hanged himself, though the case remains unresolved.

Stupak suggested that not all of the deaths are politically motivated — some may stem from internal business rivalries.

""Apart from business disputes, it could also be a case of unpaid debts, borrowed money, or even embezzlement,"" he said.

Among the most striking patterns is the recurrence of deaths caused by ""falling out of a window."" At least seven such incidents have been reported since 2022.

In September 2022,Ravil Maganov, chairman of Russia's second-largest oil firmLukoil, died after falling from a hospital window in Moscow.

While Lukoil's official obituary cited a ""serious illness,"" state media later reported he had allegedly committed suicide.

""Either you mysteriously die, or you end up behind bars.""

That same year, United Russia lawmakerPavel Antonovwas found dead at a hotel in India, lying in a pool of blood beneath his window.

Indian police said Antonov fell from the third floor, and local mediareportedthat he had been ""depressed"" over the recent death of a friend, who had died in the same hotel days earlier.

Most recently, on Feb. 6, Russian singer-songwriterVadim Stroykindied during a raid by Russian security forces.

Human rights group OVD-Info reported that Stroykin fell out of a 10th-floor window of hisSt. Petersburgapartment while officers were conducting a search linked to his alleged donation toUkraine's Armed Forces.

Russian media called the death a suicide. Stroykin had previously condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and criticized PresidentVladimir Putindirectly.

Physically throwing someone out of a window would require at least two people, making it a loud and risky operation. Yet sometimes, the intent may be precisely to send a message, Stupak added.

""Look at what happened with (Yevgeny)Prigozhin. He could've been poisoned somewhere inAfrica, and they could have easily blamed it on spoiled bananas. But they chose a demonstrative, public execution,"" he said.

Wagner Group founder Prigozhin and other Wagner leadersdied in a suspicious plane crashinside Russia in 2023. The crash came two months after Prigozhin led a brief rebellion against the Kremlin.

""So, this could be a warning to others, showing what happens if you don't pay your debts, refuse to hand over business shares, or go against Putin,"" he added.

In Russia's system, even high-ranking officials aren't safe from internal purges.

""Just recall the case ofTimur Ivanov, Russia's deputy defense minister,"" Stupak said. ""He's a Hero of Russia. Yet he was imprisoned, everything was confiscated, and his family was left with nothing.""

On July 1, Ivanov wassentencedto 13 years in a penal colony for bribery and embezzlement, the harshest punishment handed down in a recent wave ofcorruptioncases targeting senior defense officials.

""This shows just how ruthless the regime can be,"" he said. ""Either you mysteriously die, or you end up behind bars.""

Stupak believes the trend will only continue, driven by infighting and shrinking economic opportunity.

""There are noWestern companiesleft, and domestic business is stagnating. Not every business group can boast of keeping up its volumes,"" he said.

""Those who refuse to cooperate,"" he said, ""end up either in prison or out the window.""

This is despite the majority of states in the US banningall types of phone usagefor young drivers.

The research team, including scientists from Harvard University, began by interviewing 20 high school students with driver licenses about their attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control on the road.

Students from suburban and rural areas in Northeast and Western states were specifically recruited, because these teenagers were more likely to drive than those in cities.

In this group, about 70 percent admitted to spending some time looking at their phone while driving. The most common reason for this dangerous distraction? Entertainment, accounting for 65 percent of mobile phone use behind the wheel, followed by texting (40 percent) and navigation (30 percent).

Related:A 'Silent Epidemic on Wheels' Is Killing Us, And We Need to Talk About It

These teenagers explained that phone use was often motivated by ""communication with family and friends"", ""being productive"", and ""being entertained while driving"". They were aware of the accident risk and reduced visibility, and felt that keeping their phone out of reach, using ahands-free device, andbeing well-restedimproved their behavioral control.

While participants acknowledged that the important people in their lives would not want them driving distracted, they believed their friends and family did it too, which suggests the behavior is widely normalized (and the importance of setting a good example, mom and dad).

Their responses allowed the researchers to put together a 38-question survey that they took to a further 1,126 high school-age drivers (18 years old on average) from suburban and rural areas around the US.

This was when they found that young drivers spent an average of 21.1 percent of their time on the road looking at a phone. Around 26.5 percent of these glances were estimated to last longer than two seconds, a duration that puts drivers at5.5 times greater risk of a crash.

""We found that while young drivers recognize the advantages of using smartphone features like GPS, they also understand the heightened risk of accidents associated with distracted driving,""sayslead author Rebecca Robbins, a behavioral scientist from Mass General Brigham.

""Encouraging the use of 'Do Not Disturb' mode, keeping phones out of reach, and ensuring teens get adequate sleep are effective strategies to mitigate this dangerous behavior.""

While the blanket ban on phone use while driving seems straightforward, it's obviously not a foolproof solution. Robbins and teambelievethat if we want to address the serious issue of distracted driving among young people, it is imperative to understand the ""predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors to this risky behavior.""

While the survey's results are not necessarily representative of the wider population in the US or around the world, this concerning snapshot points to some practical approaches to making our roads safer.

For instance, one of the strongest beliefs these teenagers held was that distracted driving could afford them the ability to ""be productive"". The team suggests campaignsdebunking this beliefcould be an effective approach.

""Distracted driving is a serious public health threat and particularly concerning among young drivers. Driving distracted doesn't just put the driver at risk of injury or death, it puts everyone else on the road in danger of an accident,"" Robbinssays.

(ABC22/FOX44) – Vermont State Police from the Derby Barracks said that several people suffered injuries after a two-car crash in Brownington in Orleans County Friday morning.

Police reportedly learned about the crash at about 11:13 a.m. on Friday. According to authorities, John Ritchie III, 35, of Milton, crossed into the other lane of the narrow two-way Hinman Settler Road in Brownington, and hit another vehicle head-on.

Three people were reportedly taken to North Country Hospital in Newport for “severe but non-life threatening injuries.” While both cars involved in the crash, both of which were pickup trucks, were reported to be totaled, the driver of the second car, from Brownington, was reported to have suffered only minor injuries.

Vermont vehicle deaths through June lowest in five years

Police cited Ritchie III for negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

According to theNational Safety Council, “The July 4 holiday period is one of the most dangerous times of the year on U.S. roadways.” Wearing a seatbelt, avoiding drugs and alcohol while driving, and driving at a reasonable speed are several ways to reduce the risk of being in a motor vehicle accident.

(KGET) — During a drunken argument with his ex-girlfriend in May, Roman Bernal made a startling confession: he’d hit and killed a pedestrian with his car five years earlier.

His ex told him to call police and turn himself in — or she would.

In response, Bernal grabbed a cord and threatened to strangle her, the ex told police. He said he’d cut her into pieces and leave her remains in the mountains, she said according to reports filed in Superior Court.

There was a scuffle, she said, after which she called authorities.

That call led to Bernal’s arrest days later. He admitted to hitting the pedestrian and afterward repairing his Subaru Impreza to avoid getting caught, the reports say.

On Tuesday, Bernal, 28, pleaded no contest to charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and hit-and-run causing death. Charges of dissuading a witness by threats and concealing evidence were dismissed.

Prosecutors say he faces two years in prison. Sentencing is set for July 30.

The crash occurred the night of July 19, 2020, at the intersection of Chester and California avenues. Police arrived to find a man dead and the vehicle that hit him gone.

Investigators located video showing a car leaving the crash scene. They sent out a press release featuring photos of the car and a paint chip recovered from the scene.

No one came forward. Years passed with no leads.

Then Bernal’s ex called.

Detectives interviewed her and examined photos she had of the Subaru taken before the crash.

Bernal was arrested and interviewed. He confessed.

The evening of the crash, Bernal told detectives, he left his Oildale home and was headed to Tacos La Villa near South Union and Ming avenues. As he drove south on Chester Avenue, a man walked into his path, he said.

He hit the man and left the scene, Bernal said. He told detectives he went back home and hid the car. Later, Bernal said, he repaired and painted the Subaru a different color.

According to court dockets, Randy Lee Buchanan, born 1971, is charged with driving while intoxicated — causing the death of another. He’s also charged with operating a motorcycle when the operator’s driver’s license is not validated for such operation, a misdemeanor.

Nixa woman dies in motorcycle crash in Stone County

The probable cause statement says the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) was dispatched to a motor vehicle crash in Stone County at around 8:35 p.m. on Wednesday, July 2.

On scene, first responders observed a motorcycle on its side in the center of a roundabout.

As the motorcycle’s passenger — a 51-year-old Nixa woman — was inside of an ambulance being administered CPR, Buchanan told the MSHP they had been heading to a fireworks display and he wasn’t familiar with the area. He said he didn’t know there was a roundabout, the statement says.

The MSHP detected a strong odor of marijuana and alcohol emitting from Buchanan, according to the statement.

Buchanan told the MSHP he had a couple of shots and had smoked marijuana prior to driving the motorcycle. First responders found an unopened beer can in his motorcycle, as well as a metal container with marijuana inside of it.

A preliminary breath test showed Buchanan’s blood alcohol content level was .117%.

Additionally, the MSHP discovered Buchanan is not licensed to operate a motorcycle.

The passenger of Buchanan’s motorcycle was pronounced deceased at Cox South Hospital in Springfield.

Buchanan is currently being held in the Stone County Jail on a  $500,000 bond.

If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

“My dogs are my babies, my miracles, my angels,” Courtney said.

On March 15, 2024, the Navy Veteran had all three things taken away in an instant.

“I basically got struck head on, coming around the corner by a semi-truck going 55. I don’t even remember that at all. I remember leaving for work basically and waking up in the ICU that night,” Courtney said.

The 31-year-old was left paralyzed with a partial spinal cord injury, spending four months recovering in the hospital.

“I’m asking why me. Why did his happen to me God? I was in the prime of my life,” Courtney said.

What made the situation worse, Whiskey and Julie were in the car during the crash, both getting lost in the forest nearby.

With the dogs lost, the community turned to expert Babs Fry. She’s spent a decade of her life dedication to finding lost K-9s working for “a way home for dogs.”

“I knew this guy when he got out, having his family home would give him the peace to help him heal,” Fry said.

“On day six Julie was found, she got stuck in the bush. On day seven, my dog Whiskey found her way home,” Courtney said.

And reuniting never felt so good.

“..Those girls, that’s all I had man, they’re the reason I’m still here,” Courtney said.

The Iowa native went back home in a big way, racing the Iowa RAGBRI, a weeklong journey across the state, despite not having full function of his legs.

Here’s how to supportCourtney’s ride across Iowa.

“I believe God chose me to be able to work through this, overcome it and be a light and help other people to get through tough times,” Courtney said.

4 dead after two-vehicle crash in Vernon County

According to court dockets, Alex Blaine Stanley, born 1975, is charged with four counts of felony second-degree involuntary manslaughter.

The motor vehicle crash in Vernon County led to four deaths and six injuries, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol(MSHP) crash report.

The probable cause statement says the wreck occurred on Feb. 21 of this year at the intersection of U.S. 54 and State Highway C.

When the MSHP arrived on scene, they identified Stanley as one of the drivers involved in the crash.

The investigation revealed he had been traveling southbound in a 2025 Toyota Corolla when he failed to stop at the stop sign of the intersection of State Highway C and U.S. 54, according to the statement.

Stanley’s vehicle pulled into the path of an eastbound 2015 GMC Terran, which was driven by a 38-year-old Osceola man.

The impact caused Stanley’s vehicle to spin in a clockwise manner as it ran off the roadway. His vehicle continued through a fence, impacting two wooden posts and continuing until the rear of the vehicle impacted a cedar tree and came to rest.

As a result of the crash, three passengers from Stanley’s vehicle were pronounced dead at the scene — an 18-year-old woman from Springfield; a 19-year-old woman from Climax Springs; and a 21-year-old woman from Camdenton.

The driver of the GMC was also pronounced dead at the scene.

Stanley was booked in the Camden County Jail on Wednesday, July 2, and later released on a $25,000 bond.

SAN DIEGO(FOX 5/KUSI)— Three military families from San Diego that were impacted when a plane crashed on their street were honored during FOX 5’s broadcast of the Big Bay Boom fireworks show on the Fourth of July 2025.

The recognition comes just a few weeks after they were awakened at 3:47 a.m. on May 22 by a deadly plane crash on their street, which sparked multiple fires that incinerated cars and damaged nearby homes.

All six people on board the plane died, but no one on the ground was killed. However, many families were displaced for up to several days.

During the San Diego Big Bay Boom Fourth of July spectacular and fireworks show, the Atkinson, Schrader and McCarty families were just three families impacted by the plane crash that were honored during the celebrations.

The McCarty family had to move into a new home after their Murphy Canyon home was partially destroyed in the plane crash. The family of four talked about how they are doing and how the community has rallied to support them.

“I’ve been in the military for 14 years, I’ve seen some things happen. But something like this, the way the community came together — San Diego has a very special spot in my heart,” McCarty said.

FOX 5’s Kristina Audencial during the Fourth of July broadcast gifted the McCarty family a sentimental gift — the family photos and wedding photos they had on their wall in their home that was destroyed.

Costco customers are being urged to check their homes after multiple recalls were announced this week for products sold at the retailer, ranging from workout equipment to window air conditioners.

Newsweekreported that one of the most urgent notices involves Danby U-shaped window air conditioners purchased between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022.

According to Midea America Corp., the supplier, the units have a design flaw that allows water to pool inside, creating a risk for mold growth. With summer in full swing, it's imperative to pay attention if you have one of these units.

Exposure to mold can cause respiratory problems and infections. Costco is offering a full refund at any of its warehouses or a free repair kit, depending on the model. Affected units are labeled DAC080B6IWDB-6.

Another recall targets the BowFlex 552 adjustable dumbbells. Manufacturer Johnson Health Tech Trading issued a voluntary recall after reports that the weight plates could unexpectedly fall off during use, posing a potential injury risk. Customers are advised to stop using the product and return it to Costco for a full refund.

Anker also recalled several of its Model A1257 power banks over battery safety concerns. Though the company claims the risk is minimal, it is offering replacements to affected customers who provide proof of purchase.

Finally, Michelin has recalled certain Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires in the 185/60R15C size.

The tires reportedly failed to meet federal safety standards, increasing the chance of a crash. Specifically, the tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block. Customers who purchased these tires are being directed to their local Michelin retailer for free replacements.

Each of these recalls highlights different hazards, ranging from mold exposure and fire risk to physical injury, underscoring the importance of taking prompt action.

Costcomembers with any of the affected products are encouraged to stop using them immediately and follow the provided instructions for a refund or replacement.

Residents are speaking out against reckless driving and advocates are calling for an end to drunk driving.

Advocates call for action against drunk driving 5 years after tragic crash

Eric Checchio has lived along Wilikina Drive for about one year and said he has gotten used to cars racing down the road right outside his apartment building.

“Especially in the middle of the night, you’re in bed, you got little kids that got to get up for school, we’ll be in the living room watching T.V. and a car will go zipping by, or a motorcycle or something like that. Even the motorcycles do it,” Checchio said as a motorcycle revved its engine. “Prime example!”

Residents said several cars have been totaled while parked along Wilikina Drive and they will not be the last unless a solution is found. Two wrecks in the last six months have left residents on edge about reckless drivers smashing into their vehicle.

“Why should we have to worry about being parked in a stall that we pay for and have to worry about coming out the next morning to our car cleaned out?” Checchio said.

“I’ve heard probably like up to like, 20 accidents,” said Wahiawa resident Rory Redmon. “Man, like, it’s got to stop. How do you prevent this type of thing from happening? You know what I mean, in the future.”

“A lot of people follow the speed limit, yeah? And a lot don’t,” said Rory Redmon, a Wahiawa resident.

Residents add speed humps, a traffic light or even a police car with its blue light on might help the situation.

“I love HPD, I’m not trying to get down on HPD, but you know, either having HPD out here every once in a while, maybe more roving patrols,” Checchio said.

Advocates are hoping everyone makes it through the next couple of nights without a serious or fatal crash at the hands of a drunk driver over the Forth of July weekend.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-black-people-may-not-103016443.html,2025-07-05 12:00:00,"No, Black people may not be joining all of your protests. But they are still resisting","Monica Wilson was so devastated by the result of the 2024 presidential election, she couldn’t even move the day after. She had cast her ballot for Vice PresidentKamala Harrisbut became disillusioned when she learned a plurality of Americans ultimately choseDonald Trump.

“I actually was one of those Black women that said, ‘To hell with it. You do what you want. It’s your issue. You created it,’” Wilson, who serves as a Parma, Ohio, city councilwoman, recalled in a phone interview.

Wilson wasn’t alone in her anger.Black voterscarried the Democratic vote in 2024, voting for Harris at 83%, split between 89% of Black women and 75% of Black men, according to a2025 Pew Research Center report. When Harris lost to Trump,members of those majoritiesdeclared that they would not participate in any and all anti-Trump protests. But just under six months into Trump’s presidency, that declaration hasn’t exactly translated to inaction.

In Wilson’s case, that meant having a “change of heart” just three months in.

“Somewhere around March or so, I said I need to start participating because this is my life, and it is the life of my legacies — my nieces and nephews — and it’s my country,” said Wilson, who added that attending the nationwide “Hands Off” protest in early April made her come out of her post-election slump.

Harris’ ascension to the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket last summer reenergized die-hard Black Democrats in ways unseen since former President Barack Obama’s 2008 bid, with fundraising calls raking in millions of dollars for Harris’ fledgling campaign in the weeks immediately after then–President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. That momentum, coupled with the hope that the country would put its first Black and South Asian woman in the Oval Office, reinvigorated Black voters in a moment when it felt like the nation’s future again hung in the balance — and that made Harris’ loss that much more crushing a betrayal.

In the days post-election, social media was flooded with statements from Black users, particularly Black women, that they would be sitting out of protests and marches against the Trump administration. They’d done their part by turning out to vote and organizing for democracy, many said, and it would be on everyone else to dig themselves out of the inevitable social, economic and political hole Trump 2.0 would bring.

“I want people to understand how angry Black women are, and quite honestly, Black men,” Wilson said, voicing frustration over the narrative that Black men shifted toward Trump. (Pew’s post-election data indicates that Trump’s support among Black voters nearly doubled between 2024 and 2020, going from 8% to 15%).

“We have been out here, for the 20th and 19th centuries, leading the protest to get America to live and fulfill its promise, and we just got the wind knocked out of us this last election,” she added. “The majority have, if not more, responsibility to fight back because they brought this down upon us. They voted for this man, and they created the institutions of racism, they have cultivated the institution of prejudices and inequality, and they have to take responsibility for that.”

That commitment to sitting out — abstaining from anti-Trump demonstrations in favor of staying home — was apparent in the “Hands Off” protests against the administration.Reportsnotedthat crowds were largely made up of older white people, pointing tophotosfrom the actions across the country as evidence.That was in contrast with the diverse, Black-led protests that erupted in 2020 and galvanized thousands of Americans against police brutality and anti-Black racism.

Brandon Jessup, deputy director of data analytics and movement technology at State Voices, has witnessed that disillusionment among Black Americans firsthand. While door-knocking and doing outreach for the nonpartisan civic engagement network, State Voices organizers have faced a higher level of scrutiny from Black communities, he said in a phone interview.

Many are still interested in taking to the streets, as with the “No Kings” demonstrations in June. But many others, Jessup said, are skeptical of how they can continue to voice their opposition to the current administrationwhen it’s upending their lives; they’re bearing the brunt of Trump’s executive actions and legislation targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, Medicaid and other social services as well as navigating the disappointment of decades of fighting to only obtain marginal reform.

“Incremental change — that’s almost water torture, especially when our communities desire radical change, not extreme change,” Jessup told Salon. “What we’re getting from this current administration is extremism. We wanted radical change. We wanted a change that made sure that we took care of all, not less.”

Stacy Davis Gates, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, told Salon that she sees many Black women still grappling with that “rejection,” both in terms of Harris’ candidacy and the fact that some members of their communities voted for Trump “even at the peril of their own family.” Still, Davis Gates argued, it’s not clear that Black people could abstain even if they wanted to.

“One of the things that popular discourse often misses is that being Black is a political strategy within itself,” she told Salon. “From the time that we wake up to the time that we go to sleep, in the way that we have to navigate society at our jobs, in our schools, in our neighborhood, even a trip to the grocery store … I don’t think we ever truly sit out of any protest.”

Marcus Anthony Hunter, professor of sociology and African American Studies at UCLA, echoed that sentiment. Black people, he added, also must weigh the risk of engaging in demonstrations and the potential for violent encounters with law enforcementagainst their safety and livelihoods.

“There’s a calculation that is worth considering, and it sometimes means people throw that out the window and just jump out there,” said Hunter, whocoinedthe #BlackLivesMatter hashtag in 2012 before it ballooned into a movement. “But just because you don’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not caring, and that they don’t care and that they’re not doing things that raise the alarms in their communities in ways that might be less seen or less visible, but are still very much present.”

Such is the case for Meredith Turner, a Cuyahoga County councilwoman and 2024 Ohio delegate at the Democratic National Convention. Shepreviously told Salonthat, following Harris’ loss, she would not be participating in any protests or marches against the then-incoming president for the foreseeable future. Months later, she said she remains steadfast in that commitment.

“I feel like the coalition that I belong to — we’re tired. We’re tired. It’s OK for us to sit back and watch others strategize and take action,” Turner said. She added that she’s “very comfortable” withTrump supporters and Americans who didn’t vote“having to deal with the consequences of their decisions.”

But choosing to sit out doesn’t mean disengaging from the fight for democracy altogether. Turner said she’s focused on lobbying for change at the state and local levels, advocating for her constituents and participating in letter-writing campaigns appealing to state and federal Ohio officials to challenge cuts to the safety net.

“I may not be marching in the street, but I’m fully engaged where I believe I can make the most impact,” Turner said.

Meanwhile, she said she and others are turning inward to their communities to partner with local organizations, brainstorm ways to fill the gaps, cultivate Black leadership and prioritize Black joy.

“We are dealing with this in a totally different way,” Turner said. “We are having cookouts. We got our boots on the ground. We’re line dancing. We’re going about our daily life. We’re having cotillions. We’re having graduation parties. We’re trying to get the next generation engaged because we just may not be able to do anything right now.”

Black Americans’ resistance to Trump’s policies has also taken the form of boycotts and investing more in Black-owned and pro-DEI businesses. A handful of Black-led groups, spearheaded by Atlanta-basedPastor Jamal Bryant, launched a boycott of Target after the retailer announced in January that it would be sunsetting a program it started after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 aimed at helping Black employees develop their careers, boost Black-owned businesses and improve Black shoppers’ experiences. The change followed Trump’s issuance of an executive order targeting DEI in the federal government and encouraging rollbacks in the private sector.

Meanwhile, Costco’s renewed commitment to DEI in the face of Trump’s policies led Rev. Al Sharpton to orchestratea buy-inat the Washington state wholesaler with more than 100 members of the National Action Network.

While it’s unclear the exact impact the boycott has had, so far this year Target’s foot traffic has slowed, stock prices have plunged andnet quarterly sales have decreasedcompared to 2024 numbers. At the same time, Black and Hispanic households appeared to be pulling back visits at a disproportionately high rate in the weeks following Target’s DEI rollback, according to a MarchNumerator report. In contrast, the report said, Costco “attracted many of these same consumers” and saw a 7.7 million increase in visits over a four-week period that ended Feb. 9.

Yusuf Johnson counted himself among those new Costco visitors this year, going so far as to purchase a membership and tell his store’s staff his reasons for doing so. While the Florida-based IT project manager said he was never one for participating in demonstrations, in part, due to the danger of police encounters that Black men face, he has always tried to resist through spreading knowledge in blogs, social media posts and more recently, creating YouTube videos.

“I think if you’re not going to be on the streets, you should be ridiculously vocal,” Johnson said, arguing that actions without explanations are “not good enough.” He also said he worries that online calls to “sit out” will lead to more people disengaging from resistance and politics altogether in favor of placing the onus squarely on white Americans. Maybe abstaining while calling on white people to get involved can work, he added. “But if it turns into people just simply shutting down from any form of gaining knowledge, … [of] current events, then I think it’s going to be damaging to us.”

Johnson’s longtime friend, Angelina Hamilton Steiner, on the other hand, occupies something of a middle ground. The founder of Madison Court Community Coalition, a grassroots youth engagement organization in Lakewood, Ohio, told Salon she understands and respects Black Americans’ decision to pull back from the frontlines of activism, having come out of the election feeling “dejected” herself. Still, she said, she knew she had to do something.

“I am still wanting to keep fighting. I’m not wanting to give up hope because, for me, this is just as much my country as it is their country,” she said.

Her solution has been to focus on the local level and work to alleviate the manifestations of federal policies on everyday people. She applied to be appointed to the vacant seat on the Lakewood, Ohio, city council and was selected to fill the role in January. She’s also taken part in a few Cleveland-area protests, though she said she’s engaging in demonstrations at a much slower pace than she had before the election.

How to approach resistance going forward, she said, is a decision that every Black American needs to make for themselves, regardless of what others think.

“I think this is on the white collective to get out there and save your country and be at these protests and put your bodies out there on the front line,” Hamilton Steiner added. “Our bodies have been on the frontline since this country was founded and have founded this country.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-netanyahu-heading-oval-office-135051115.html,2025-07-05 15:30:00,Trump and Netanyahu are heading for an Oval Office showdown,"Bibi Netanyahu’s Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump on Monday could be a game-changer. They will undoubtedly focus on Iran, Gaza, and Syria’s new regime among other subjects. But how close are the two leaders’ positions, and can their differences be reconciled?

Both will declare the meeting “successful,” but the reality may be quite different. Trump crossed a Rubicon by ordering direct US militaryaction against nuclear-weapons-related targets in Iran. He may think the strikes were simply a “one and done” affair, but, if so, he is badly mistaken. Trump put his personal prestige on the line, not to mention America’s. Despite his contention that the B-2 bunker-buster raids “completely and totally obliterated” the targeted nuclear-program sites, much remains to be done.

No one knows that better than Netanyahu, who hasfocused on the Iranian nuclear threat for over three decades. Although he persuaded (or manoeuvred) Trump into using military force, the US President swerved immediately after receiving favourable reports on the strikes to impose a cease-fire on Israel and Iran.

Netanyahu had little choice but to stand down, having achieved two major objectives: getting Trump into the fight andimposing significant, albeit not fatal, damage on Iran’s nuclear project. Iran also had little choice, having been pounded by Israel and the US, but to launch merely pro forma retaliation, shake its rhetorical fist in defiance, and hope to escape any additional destruction.

Nonetheless, Netanyahu sees that the time is ripe for further action against Iran, including actions to encourage the domestic opposition to move against the ayatollahs. Iran’s air defences are now essentially flat, but the moment will not last forever. Top Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists have been eliminated, but their ranks will reform, and their respective work will resume. The ayatollahs have clearly signalled their continuing resolve by effectively expelling all International Atomic Energy Agency personnel from the country.

The last thing Netanyahu wants is for Trump to throw Tehran an economic or political lifeline. Israel seeks regime change in Iran, and Netanyahu needs at least Trump’s acquiescence for Israel to continue deconstructing the remains of Iran’s nuclear enterprise. Further US participation would be icing on the cake. By contrast, Trump desperately wants a Nobel Peace Prize. After all, he reasons, Barack Obama received one (which he didn’t deserve), so why not Trump?

Trump’s Nobel obsessionnow seems concentrated on Gaza, where the ongoing conflict has intensified since the Israel-Iran ceasefire took effect. He has pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach agreement to effect the return some still-unsettled number of Israeli hostages and remains, in exchange releasing possibly 1,000 Hamas prisoners in Israeli custody, plus a 60-day ceasefire. The sticking point remains Hamas’s insistence on a complete end to the war, or, reportedly, a commitment that talks to end the war commence immediately after the hostage/prisoner exchanges.

This sort of framework has been used before, but its durability remains just as doubtful as other post-October 7, 2023 efforts. Trump wants to announce a cease-fire on or before the Monday meeting, but how long it lasts is anyone’s guess. Hamas undoubtedly wants relief from Israeli military strikes, and domestic political pressure to secure the release of more hostages has left Netanyahu little manoeuvring room. But, apart from humanitarian objectives regarding the hostages, Israel gains no strategic upside from yet another cease fire. Israel has repeatedly suspended combat operations and withdrawn from already-secured positions in Gaza, and then been forced to re-take them, at considerable human and material costs to the Israeli Defense Forces. Lengthening the war also imposes additional strains on an already stressed Israeli economy.

The collapse of Syria’s Assad regime, replaced by former Al-Nusra Front terrorists (now known as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, or “HTS”), was undoubtedly a serious setback for Iran. Acceding to Saudi Arabia’s requests, Trumplifted US economic sanctions previously imposed against Assad’s government, but substantial questions remain whether HTS has actually renounced terrorism.

Its leader, Syria’s de facto head of government, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is also an unknown, having shed his combat fatigues for a suit, trimmed his beard, and dropped his nom de guerre for, apparently, his real name. In the meantime, Israel continues military operations inside Syria, in addition to holding onto an extended buffer zone occupied after Assad’s fall.

Perhaps nothing concrete regarding Syria will emerge from the Netanyahu-Trump meeting, but the two leaders need a better sense of each other’s concerns and objectives. Since the First World War, the Middle East has seen more diplomatic efforts crash and burn than any other geographic hot spot. Iran and Gaza today are unlikely to prove more successful.

Monday’s most important outcome in the West Wing will be decisions on the possible further use of US and Israeli military force to achieve key objectives on both fronts.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/starmer-government-grossly-naive-threat-142227666.html,2025-07-05 16:00:00,Starmer’s Government is grossly naive about the threat posed by China,"The Labour government’s China policy is a shambles. It did not list China as a top threat under its new foreign-influence rules – even though the government admits that China has undermined Britain’s economic security and engaged in espionage and acts intended to undermine democracy.

The government’s failure to apply these rules means that China, and China-controlled entities, do not have to register their activities with the British government.

Those who lobbied against designating China as a top-tier threat argued that it would have a chilling effect on closer economic ties. The China lobby carried the day. It’s part of a pattern that sees London determined not to offend China ahead of Keir Starmer’s rumoured trip to Beijing later this year.

“China will continue to play a vital role in supporting the UK’s secure growth,” David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said last week in a speech announcing the country’s new engagement policy, the China Audit, tucked inside the UK’s National Security Strategy.

The governmentseems set on emulating the “golden years,”when David Cameron and China’s leader Xi Jinpingshared a pint at a British pub, even as the danger posed by China grows more pronounced.

“Cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must,” coos Labour, but there’s little challenge. Why has Labour gone off the rails with its China policy?

Starmer’s background as a human rights lawyer and Labour’s historical concern for human rights have fallen victim to a mistaken belief that China will somehow save the British economy.

Starmer is right to focus on economic growth. But he’s looking for it in the wrong place. Despite being the world’s second-largest economy, China registers below France as a British trading partner, and remains an insignificant investor.

China dominates trade between the two countries, with its almost £70 billion exports to Britain, more than double the £29.7 billion Britain sends to the People’s Republic.

Britain’s exports to China fell by £3.8 billion, or 12 per cent, in 2024 and accounted for only 3.4 per cent of the country’s shipments abroad. The EU and US made up 63.8 per cent of the total. The investment picture is even less promising, with Sino-British investments well under one percent of total investments.

With its economy faltering under a sustained property crash, China hardly seems like the market of the future, notwithstanding the boasts of Rachel Reeves, who says she signed deals during a trip to Beijing in January that would bring an additional £600 million in benefits to Britain over the next five years.

Britain has proven unwilling or unable to hold China to account for breaching its treaty obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Britain handed Hong Kong to China in exchange for a promise that the colony would enjoy its tradition of freedom and would be protected by the common-law system. China shredded that agreement. In the five years since Beijing imposed a vague and sweeping National Security Law on the city, nearly 2,000 people have been jailed on political charges. Newspapers have been forcibly shuttered, and the last remaining pro-democracy party this week announced it has been forced to disband.

Jimmy Lai, a newspaper publisher andBritish citizen, remains in solitary confinementin Hong Kong, jailed for more than 1,600 days because of his commitment to free speech and his desire to uphold the values that Britain bequeathed to its former colony. British diplomats have not even been able to meet with Mr Lai to provide consular access.

In London, officials prepare to approve a mega-embassy, China’s largest diplomatic outpost in Europe, despite opposition ranging from London residents to US politicians. The irony is that this will do little for the economy all while undermining the very national security that it’s designed to protect.

During her trip to Beijing in January, Rachel Reeves published an opinion piece in The Times titled, “Choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all.” That’s setting up a strawman. No one issuggesting that engagement with China should be cut off. But engagement should uphold the British values of freedom, liberty, and the rule of law rather than rewarding China for its lawless behaviour.

The Seattle Police Department (SPD) says multiple people inside sustained minor injuries in the crash.

At around 8:20 p.m., SPD says the driver of a white Chevrolet Tahoe ran a red light on 35th Avenue Northeast and swerved into Mioposto with customers inside.

The vehicle destroyed the entire front side of the building and took out its main support beam.

Vania Kurniawati and her friend were sitting at a table by the restaurant for a quiet Fourth of July dinner when the car crashed into the building.

“I saw this car coming out of the corner of my eye, like driving towards us, which was so surreal it kind of looked like it was a movie. And then next thing you know, things came crashing down and I felt glass shards everywhere,” said Kurniawati.

The two of them, along with another customer, were rushed to the hospital.

She had several cuts to her face and arms, while her friend suffered broken ribs and other injuries.

“ I just never thought it would happen because it’s such a like residential area and it seems like really safe,” she said.

She says that the restaurant directed them away from the windows and to the back of the building.

Kate Holman, General Manager of the location, says she is proud of her staff’s quick thinking to take care of their customers.

Holman believes it could have had a very different outcome if it hadn’t been for the slower night due to the holiday.

“If it was a normal Friday night, it would’ve been horrific because every table would’ve been full and people have been waiting outside, and I can’t even, I don’t even wanna imagine what would’ve happened,” she said.

Officers determined that the driver was not under the influence.

However, the driver will be cited and may face significant financial penalties in civil court.

Mioposto’s Ravenna location is expected to be closed for several months to take care of repairs that will cost more than $100,000.

Mioposto is encouraging people to visit their other locations in Mount Baker, Admiral, Mercer Island and Eastlake until repairs are finished."
