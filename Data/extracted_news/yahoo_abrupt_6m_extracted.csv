A Baltimore City man who was wrongly convicted of a murder nearly three decades ago will receive almost $3 million from the state — compensation for 27 years locked in prison for a crime he did not commit.

The Board of Public Works unanimously approved the payment Wednesday — and offered a public apology — to James Langhorne, who was exonerated in February in the 1996 death of Lawrence Jones.

Langhorne, in comments to the board, said the compensation is welcome, but that more should be done to help those trying to reenter society after decades behind bars.

“There’s not a lot of resources for people in our situation,” said Langhorne, who said he felt ill-prepared for his abrupt release. “You come home different from people who are generally released. You’re just let out. There’s no preparation.

“You didn’t even really know you were getting released. The moment comes up, they realize that you really didn’t commit the crime. They file something. You go to court and you just come home,” he said.

But years in prison meant Langhorne — and other exonerees — are released with no savings, no credit, no insurance or other support.

“You come out exonerated but you’re facing so many difficulties,” he said. “I’ve known of people who were exonerated who couldn’t maintain and now they’re back in prison for crimes they did commit. So that in itself is a travesty.”

Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D) recounted her meeting with Langhorne, in which he described going to prison for a crime he did not commit as “a trauma” and being retraumatized by being released without preparation or assistance.

Miller, chairing the board meeting  Wednesday in place of Gov. Wes Moore (D), told Langhorne she was “really sorry to hear you were faced with a situation” where assistance “wasn’t waiting for you as we should have been.”

“Your comments that you shared with me are noted and I assure you we will follow up on behalf of the state,” she said.

The settlement approved by the board includes compensation for the time Langhorne spent in prison as well as housing costs and attorney’s fees.

The payments follow funding formulas established in the Walter Lomax Act, a 2021 law named for a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent nearly four decades in prison. Under the law, compensation for proven or pardoned wrongful incarceration is determined by the length of time served and the state’s median income.

Currently, that formula sets the payment at $101,652 annually, or more than $2.7 million for the 27 years Langhorne served.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

People can also get housing, vocational training and health care. The board approval included $99,720 in housing assistance for Langhorne from the state Department of Housing and Community Development and a nearly $4,700 payment to Flowers Keller LLP, the law firm that represented him.

“Nearly three decades were stolen from Mr. Langhorne, depriving him of the opportunity to pursue a career, to build a family, to contribute to our state,” Miller said.

Langhorne was arrested in 1996 and charged with the murder of Lawrence Jones. He was convicted in Baltimore City two years later despite several problems in the case against him, including witness testimony that was either unreliable or conflicting. Another witness recanted their account and prosecutors were found to have withheld information about other potential suspects.

That conviction was vacated in February after a review of the case by the conviction integrity unit of the Baltimore City Office of the State’s Attorney. Langhorne had spent 9,870 days in prison by that time.

Langhorne said he has attempted to move past his wrongful conviction.

“It’s wonderful to hear people say how sorry they are for what we went through. I myself, I don’t hold you at fault. I understand that things go wrong,” Langhorne said. “Yes, I am angry at those who violated their trust as public servants to go above and beyond to ruin a man’s life, a father’s life, to obtain a conviction, so that is what I am angry at. But to be angry overall serves no purpose. That’s something you have to let go.”

Miller, in her apology to Langhorne, added “there are no words to express how deeply sorry we are for what was taken from him and for the failure of our justice system.”

“And again, while no amount of money can raise the injustice you face over the time that was stolen from you, I hope today’s action by the board provides meaningful support, healing and comfort as you step into the next chapter of your life. May peace be with you.

While the money paid to Langhorne and his attorneys comes entirely from the state, that is about to change. The state budget that took effect Tuesday includes a requirement that jurisdictions where someone was found to have been erroneously convicted have to share equally in the cost of compensation.

Because Langhorne’s case before an administrative law judge was finalized and sent to the board before July 1, however, Baltimore City will not have to pay any of the costs.

The board also unanimously approved — with little discussion — a request to amend a software purchase that increases the cost to the state by 63%.

Two years ago, the board approved a contract to license software valued at more than $40.4 million. The contract piggybacked off a deal by the city of Mesa, Arizona.

Documents filed with the Board of Public Works said that problems with internal financial systems used by the Department of General Services and the Maryland Department of Transportation led to “financial discrepancies” in the cost of the contract. The problem resulted in an additional $18.1 million in retroactive costs and another $7.5 million for the contract that runs through the end of September.

“While DGS and MDOT have not yet been able to resolve these challenges due to technical limitations of the FMIS system, both agencies are aware of the situation and are working towards a resolution,” according to information provided to the board by the Department of General Services. “We will continue to monitor the situation and take necessary steps as appropriate to help ensure these matters are resolved.”"

https://www.yahoo.com/news/severe-thunderstorm-watch-affecting-10-173330169.html,2025-07-03 19:15:00,Severe thunderstorm watch affecting 10 Massachusetts counties until Thursday night,"A severe thunderstorm watch was issued by the National Weather Service on Thursday at 1:31 p.m. in effect until 10 p.m. for Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk and Worcester counties.

Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.

To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:

Lightning safety plan:

When venturing outdoors, it’s vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.

Stay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it’s a clear indication of nearby lightning.

Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.

Indoors safety measures:

Once you’re indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors.

These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways.

Wait for the all-clear:

After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.

It’s important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.

When indoor shelter isn’t available:

If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:

Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.

Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.

If you’re in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.

Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.

Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.

In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.

Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:

Beware of swollen waterways:

During heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Slow down and stay cautious:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.

Prioritize visibility

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

Beware of rapid water flow:

During heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Reduce speed and drive cautiously:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.

Prioritize visibility

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Heavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

They influence how people learn about the world around them and perceive their place in it.

Names can send messages and suggest what is and isn’tvalued in society. And the way that they are changed over time cansignal cultural shifts.

The United States isin the midst of a place-renaming moment. From the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to theGulf of America, to the return ofForts BraggandBenningand the newlyre-renamed Mount McKinleyin Alaska’s Denali National Park, we are witnessing a consequential shift in the politics of place naming.

This sudden rewriting of the nation’s map – done to “restore American greatness,” according to President Donald Trump’sexecutive order that made some of them official– is part of a name game that recognizes place namesas powerful brandsandpolitical tools.

In our researchonplace naming, we explore how this “name game” is used to assert control over shared symbols and embed subtle and not-so-subtle messages in the landscape.

Asgeographyteachersandresearchers, we also recognize the educational and emotional impact the name game can have on the public.

Renaming a place is alwaysan act of power.

People in power havelong used place namingtoclaim controlover the identity of the place, bolster their reputations,retaliate against opponentsand achieve political goals.

These moves can have strongpsychological effects, particularly when the name evokes something threatening. Changing a place name can fundamentally shift how people view, relate to or feel that theybelong within that place.

In Shenandoah County, Virginia, students at two schools originally named for Confederate generals have been on an emotional roller coaster of name changes in recent years. The schools wererenamed Mountain View and Honey Runin 2020 amid the national uproar over the murder of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a police officer in Minneapolis.

Four years later, the local school boardreinstated the original Confederate namesafter conservatives took control of the board.

One Black eighth grader at Mountain View High School — now re-renamed Stonewall Jackson High School —testified at a board meetingabout how the planned change would affect her:

“I would have to represent a man that fought for my ancestors to be slaves. If this board decides to restore the names, I would not feel like I was valued and respected,” she said. The board stillapproved the change, 5-1.

Even outside of schools, place names operate as a “hidden curriculum.” They provide narratives to the public about how the community or nation sees itself – as well as whose histories and perspectives it considers important or worthy of public attention.

Place names affect how people perceive, experience and emotionally connect to their surroundings inboth conscious and subconscious ways. Psychologists, sociologists and geographers have explored how thissense of place manifests itself into the psyche, creating eitherattachmentor aversion to place, whether it’s a school, mountain or park.

Renaming places canrally a leader’s supporters through rebranding.

Trump’s orders to restore the names Fort Bragg and Fort Benning, both originally named for Confederate generals, illustrate this effect. The names were changed to Fort Liberty and Fort Moore in 2023 after Congresspassed a law banning the use of Confederate namesfor federal installations.

Trump made acampaign promiseto his followers to “bring back the name” of Fort Bragg if reelected.

To get around the federal ban, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth identified two unrelated decorated Army veterans with the same last names — Bragg and Benning — but without any Confederate connections, to honor instead.

Call it a sleight of hand or a stroke of genius if you’d like, this tactic allowed the Department of Defense to revive politically charged names without violating the law.

Therestoration of the names Bragg and Benningmay feel like a symbolic homecoming for those who resisted the original name change or haveemotional tiesto the names through their memories of living and serving on the base, rather than a connection to the specific namesakes.

However, the names are still reminders of the military bases’original associationwith defenders of slavery.

A wave of place-name changes during the Obama and Biden administrations focused onremoving offensive or derogatory place namesand recognizing Indigenous names.

For example, Clingmans Dome, the highest peak in the Great Smoky Mountains,was renamed to Kuwohi in September 2024, shifting the name from a Confederate general to a Cherokee word meaning “the mulberry place.”

Under the Trump administration, however, place-name changes are being advancedexplicitly to push backagainst reform efforts, part of a broader assault on what Trump calls “woke culture.”

President Barack Obama changedAlaska’s Mount McKinley to Denali in 2015to acknowledge Indigenous heritage and a long-standing name for the mountain.Officials in Alaska had requested the name changeto Denali years earlier and supported the name change in 2015.

Trump, on his first day in office in January 2025, moved torename Denali back to Mount McKinley, over the opposition of Republican politicians in Alaska. The state Legislaturepassed a resolutiona few days later asking Trump to reconsider.

Georgia Rep. Earl “Buddy” Carter made arecent legislative proposalto rename Greenland as “Red, White, and Blueland” in support of Trump’s expansionist desire to purchase the island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Danish officials and Greenlanders saw Carter’s absurd proposal as insulting anddamaging to diplomatic relations. It is not the first time that place renaming has beenused as a form of symbolic insult in international relations.

Renaming the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America might have initially seemed improbable, but it is alreadyreflected in common navigation apps.

When leaders rename a place in an abrupt, unilateral fashion — often for ideological reasons — they risk alienating communities that deeply connect with those names as a form of memory, identity and place attachment.

Abetter alternative, in our view, would be to make renaming shared landscapesparticipatory, with opportunities for meaningful public involvement in the renaming process.

This approach does not avoid name changes, but it suggests the changes should respond to the social and psychological needs of communities and the evolving cultural identity of places — and not simply be used to score political points.

Instead, encouraging public participation — such as throughlandscape impact assessmentsandcritical auditsthat take the needs of affected communities seriously — can cultivate a sense of shared ownership in the decision that may give those names more staying power.

The latest place renamings are alreadyaffecting the classroom experience. Students are not just memorizing new place labels, but they are also being asked to reevaluate the meaning of those places andtheir own relationshipwith the nation and the world.

Ashistory has shown around the world, one of the major downsides of leaders imposing name changes is that the names can be easily replaced as soon as the next regime takes power. The result can be a never-ending name game.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/sensory-issues-fourth-july-010435159.html,2025-07-04 03:15:00,Sensory issues and the Fourth of July,"WEST VIRGINIA, WV (WVNS) – As you prepare to celebrate America’s independence this weekend, first responders are reminding members of the public to be mindful about how our celebrations can affect those who see the world a little differently.

Setting off fireworks is a tried-and-true tradition in America’s collective celebration of our country’s independence. But while the spectacle can make for an exciting atmosphere, the noise and commotion can be upsetting to some.

Director of Ancillary Services for Jan-Care Ambulance, Paul Seamann said it is important to be considerate of those with sensory issues or PTSD when planning our celebrations.

How to properly dispose of your used fireworks

“If you have neurodivergent children or adults, that abrupt sound is not something their normally acute to and it can be very distressing,” said Seamann. “For those that have been in different environments, and they may have PTSD, it’s very triggering.”

Those celebrating with sensory conditions can use headphones or earplugs while enjoying fireworks to dampen the potentially overwhelming noise.

Experts also recommend filling in your neighbors on your celebration plans beforehand to ensure there will not be any issues once the pyrotechnics get going.“Just be considerate of your neighbor. If you’re setting them off and your neighbors, ask you to tone it down or to stop. Just be considerate of those around you,” said P.F.C. Justice with the Beckley Police Department. “Celebrate the fourth, have a good time with it. But just be considerate of those around you.”

The Fourth of July is all about freedom, and part of that freedom is helping to create a safe and inclusive Independence Day for all Americans.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/megabill-hits-health-care-immigrants-160000745.html,2025-07-04 16:30:00,"Megabill hits health care for immigrants, including legal ones, hard","As President Donald Trump intensifies his targeting of undocumented immigrants, the GOP megabill passed Thursday takes aim at those here legally by revoking their access to subsidized care.

Under current rules, those immigrants — green card holders, refugees, survivors of domestic violence, and individuals on work and student visas — can purchase health insurance on the Obamacare marketplace and receive tax credits to offset the cost. Some of them are also eligible for coverage through Medicaid, the state-federal program for low-income people, if they earn incomes below the poverty level, as well as Medicare, the federal program for elderly people.

But the provisions in the GOP megabill narrow immigrant eligibility for these programs, allowing only green card holders, immigrants from Cuba and Haiti, and immigrants from certain Pacific Island countries access to federally funded health care.

The move to restrict coverage for legal immigrants comes as the Trump administration pushes ahead on its aggressive immigration campaign, delivering mass deportations, challenging birthright citizenship, and ending temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants.

“These are the largest cuts to health coverage that we have seen, and this will be one of the largest cuts to immigrants in recent years,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy think tank in Washington. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan scorekeeper, estimated similar provisions would leave 1.3 million lawfully present immigrants uninsured in 2034. Low-income green card holders in the five-year waiting period that applies to them for Medicaid, but who are currently eligible for subsidized Obamacare coverage, are expected to be the largest group hit.

The provisions have been overshadowed by broader Medicaid cuts, and the politically fraught nature of immigration has made Republicans reluctant to speak out about the restrictions. Still, they have raised concerns in both red and blue states because it would mean their already financially strained health care systems would have to bear the higher costs of uncompensated and emergency care.

“There is a lot of concern about how some of the immigration policies and some of the enrollment policies might play out throughout our patient population and our communities,” said Jonathan Chapman, chief executive of the Florida Association of Community Health Centers, who flew to Washington last week to lobby Congress and the White House on the megabill. Over 70 percent of patients at the state’s federally qualified health centers are uninsured or on Medicaid, and they have already reduced services due to insufficient funding.

Chapman added that Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’ support for Trump’s crackdown has already discouraged patients from seeking care at the community health centers, even though they typically do not ask about immigration status. “If my status was not clearly defined, I would be concerned about signing anything,” he added.

Vern Buchanan(R-Fla.), vice chair of the Ways and Means Committee, told POLITICO the megabill “ensures that federal health care dollars are prioritized for American citizens.” Buchanan led a letter with 11 members of the Florida Republican House delegation supporting the megabill.

Under fiscal pressure, blue states, including Minnesota and Illinois, have moved to roll back health care access for undocumented immigrants, who are not eligible for any federally subsidized health care programs. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, approved a state budget that will scale back free health care for undocumented immigrants.

One of the hardest-hit states from the megabill restrictions on immigrants will be New York, which is one of three states that have enacted a basic health program allowed under the Affordable Care Act known as the Essential Plan.

The Essential Plan offers low-cost health insurance for New Yorkers earning up to 250 percent above the federal poverty line and is funded by federal dollars that would otherwise be used for ACA tax credits. The GOP megabill will strip coverage for half a million immigrants covered by the plan and shift the cost to New York. The state must pick up the tab because of a 2001 state court decision that requires it to cover immigrants who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status.

The state’s hospital lobby, the Greater New York Hospital Association, believes the provisions as a whole will cost New York $3 billion annually and leave 225,000 immigrant New Yorkers uninsured.

“The downstream impacts are not just on immigrants,” said Elisabeth Wynn, executive vice president at the New York hospital group. “We don’t close services for a particular insurance category, those get closed for all.”

Earlier this month, five Republican House members from New York wrote a letter to Senate Finance ChairMike Crapo(R-Idaho) urging a two- to three-year delay to the immigrant restrictions, warning an “abrupt elimination…will have drastically disruptive consequences for New York’s healthcare system.”

The bill will exclude lawfully present immigrants earning below the federal poverty level from the Obamacare marketplace starting next year. Marketplace restrictions for lawfully present immigrants earning above the poverty level will start in 2027."

The letters, released Thursdayfollowing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Google shareholder Anthony Tan, show that Bondi told the companies integral to TikTok’s U.S. operations that Trump believed the abrupt shutdown of the app would “interfere with the execution of [his] constitutional duties to take care of national security and foreign affairs.”

Therefore, Bondi said, those companies “may continue to provide services to TikTok as contemplated ... without violating the Act, and without incurring any legal liability.”

Bondi added that the department would shield the companies from anyone else trying to penalize them for violating the TikTok divest-or-ban law, including by “filing amicus briefs, statements of interest or intervening in litigation.”

The New York Times alsoobtained some of Bondi’s lettersfollowing its own FOIA lawsuit for the correspondence.

The other eight companies who received letters by Bondi include: Amazon, Microsoft, Akamai Technologies, Digital Realty Trust, Fastly, T-Mobile, Oracle and LG Electronics USA.

Last year, former President Joe Biden signed a package of foreign aid bills into law, including a provision to force ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to sell its stake in the platform or risk being banned from U.S. app stores over national security concerns, prompting the platform to go dark temporarily.

Following his inauguration in January, Trump immediatelysigned an executive orderdirecting the DOJ to not enforce the law, giving TikTok 75 days to find a U.S. buyer. The president has since extended that deadline three times.

Following the passage of the law, Google and Apple briefly removed TikTok from their app stores.Reports at the timeattributed the platform’s return to app stores to Bondi assuaging their concerns. But the letters had not been made public at the time.

Meanwhile, Trump, who last month gave TikTok another 90-day extension to comply with the law, told Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo he’s making progress on a potential sale,adding that he expects to announce a buyer soonas concerns about its long-term future in the U.S. remain.

The sale would still require Beijing’s approval, but Trump sounded confident China wouldn’t block it.

“I think President Xi [Jinping] will probably do it,” Trump told Bartiromo.

Trump Says He'll Announce TikTok Buyer In 'About Two Weeks'"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-wants-more-skilled-tradespeople-080024479.html,2025-07-05 13:30:00,Trump wants more skilled tradespeople. His Labor Department is trying to cut off a pipeline of workers,"Eighteen months ago, at around 7 p.m. practically every night, Chloe Lawson would start a four-mile walk to Subway, where she’d work the overnight shift, earning a buck above the $7.25 federal minimum wage.

Eight hours later, the then 19-year-old would clock out and head back to find somewhere to hopefully get some sleep.

She had no family, no friends she could stay with in Splendora, Texas, a small town outside Houston. She often found herself at “some shady hotel” or other unsafe places.

“I honestly didn’t have a future,” she said.

That’s changed in the year and a half since: Lawson, now 21, has interviews lined up to be a train conductor, a job that starts out with an $80,000 annual salary and could open the door for other higher-earning positions in the years to come.

But the vocational training program that got her and many others into better jobs is suddenly in jeopardy.

Lawson is one of at least 21,000 current students whose coursework and hands-on training were upended by the Department of Labor’s announcement in late May to pause operations at Job Corps, a residential career training program for low-income and at-risk youth that was started 60 years ago under President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty.

The Labor Department,citing budget deficits and claiming poor results,said that it was halting contracts on the 99 private-contractor-operated sites under its purview by the end of June and that it would initiate an orderly transition of students from the residential program into their respective communities. The move is part of a broader push within the Trump administration to slash federal programs.

“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement at the time. She noted that an analysis of the program raised concerns about safety and its fiscal health. “We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities.”

The National Job Corps Association, a trade organization of center operators and other community and business organizations that support the centers,have pushed backon the Labor Department’s claims, arguing that the analysis cherry-picked data distorted by the pandemic and sensationalized the safety aspect (which the organization stated were the result of strict reporting requirements and included incidents such as injuries, power outages and adult students leaving campus without approval).

However, the abrupt suspension and potential long-term closure of Job Corps carries far-reaching implications, economists, employers,attorneys generalandmembers of Congresscaution: If Job Corps goes dark, the Labor Department is cutting off a long-forged pipeline of young, skilled trades workers not only when there’s a shortage but also when President Donald Trump is seeking to revitalize the US manufacturing industry.

“We have a very strong need for those with less than a bachelor’s degree,” Rachel Sederberg, senior economist at Lightcast, a labor market data and analytics firm, told CNN in an interview. Those include maintenance workers, truck drivers and healthcare roles such medical assistants, she said, adding: “These are very critical jobs for our economy and for our day-to-day as consumers.”

“We’re going to start feeling it quite acutely if we aren’t able to get things in our homes fixed or it takes longer to get things manufactured and transported and into our stores.”

The abrupt May 29 announcementsent staff scrambling at Job Corps centers nationwide, and, in some cases, resulted in students heading back to the streets.

The operators of several centers filed a lawsuit in federal district court challenging the government’s move. Late last month, a judge in the case gave Job Corps a reprieve, granting a preliminary injunction on the suspension of operations.

However, that lifeline is likely temporary: Arecent Supreme Court rulingthat limited nationwide injunctions could affect the outcome of the Job Corps case and, in turn, the program’s operations. And, ultimately, Job Corps’ ongoing operations come down to whether Congress continues to fund it.

A Department of Labor spokesperson told CNN that the agency is not conducting interviews at this time but provided a statement following the injunction ruling: “The Department of Labor is working closely with the Department of Justice to evaluate and comply with the temporary restraining order. We remain confident that our actions are consistent with the law.”

The Department of Labor pointed CNN toan online FAQabout the Job Corps pause.

“The Department of Labor is collaborating with state and local workforce partners to assist current students in advancing their training and connecting them with education and employment opportunities,” the FAQ reads in part.

Trump, like presidentsObamaandBiden, has long stated a desire to revive US manufacturing. Trump has sought to wield tariffs as a solution. However, economists and supply chain analysts have questioned the effectiveness ofthat approach.

“The Job Corps program was underperforming with massive safety concerns in a $140 million deficit,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, told CNN on Saturday. “Instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on this failing program, President Trump has tasked his Administration with overhauling and modernizing workforce programs to prepare Americans for high-paying, skilled trade jobs.”

The White House noted that the Trump administration has instead sought to surpass 1 million new active apprenticeships.

In the meantime, industry members long involved with the Jobs Corps program fear they’re losing opportunities to educate, train and place new workers to meet growing demand and help fill the void left by retiring tradespeople.

A report last year from McKinsey & Company estimated that from 2022 to 2032, the annual hiring for “critical skilled trades” roles (such as carpenters, electricians, plumbers, welders and laborers) is projected to be 20 times that of all other jobs.

A shutdown of Job Corps threatens to negatively ripple through the economy, said Arthur Maratea, national president of the Transportation Communications Union/IAM. The union has taught, trained, counseled and helped place more than 16,000 Job Corps Advanced Training students in railroad industry jobs since 1971.

“It will definitely hurt the labor market, that I can tell you,” Maratea told CNN, “because going into the trades, there are not that many apprenticeships. We’re short electricians, we’re short on our carmen, we’re short everything.”

Job Corps has provided a consistent stream of trained workers to railroad operators, helping them find employees while saving on costs, Maratea said. Without those added workers, supply chains could be disrupted.

“If we’re not there, the freights are not going to have enough people to do the job, which mean there’s hold-ups at the ports on goods coming in,” he said. “It’s going to affect commuters, and it’s going to affect our food chain lines. There’s a bigger picture to this.”

In June, the labor force participation rate for 16- to 24-year-olds fell for the third consecutive month and landed at 54.9%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

That rate is 13 percentage points below where it was in March 1990, when youth employment participation peaked at 67.9%. For comparison, the overall labor force participation fell 4.4 percentage points to 62.3% between March 1990 and June 2025, BLS data shows.

“We know that those from less-advantaged backgrounds can benefit from additional mentorship, can benefit from stability that a job might provide and from understanding various parts of the labor market that they might not have been exposed to otherwise,” said Lightcast’s Sederberg, who has researched the outcomes of employment programs for teens and young adults. “Anything that’s increasing youth involvement within the labor force, increasing opportunities, is something that we should be trying to do more of.”

In 2019, Jasmine Geib said she was on a fast track to a low-paying job and getting even further in debt with student loans.

“I was taking a break from college. I didn’t feel ready to go back there; I also was in a really bad place in my life, went through a bad breakup, and I just had nowhere else to go,” said Geib, 29, in an interview last week with CNN. “I was basically homeless, living couch to couch, and my friend went to Job Corps before me and told me about it.”

Geib had a dream of becoming a flight attendant and sought advanced education at Job Corps; however, opportunities shifted, and she ended up going through the union-run railroad training program in Excelsior Springs, Missouri.

Geib now is four years into a job at Union Pacific, where she is a licensed conductor and engineer and currently helping to move locomotives at the North Platte, Nebraska, hub as a hostler. She’s making $90,000 to $100,000 a year with the potential of having that double in a matter of years.

In recent weeks, both Geib and Lawson have jumped into advocacy roles, writing letters to congresspeople and sharing their experiences on social media about Job Corps.

“I feel like, if they need to do something, they can reform it; but I don’t think they should full-blown shut it down,” Geib said.

Lawson, who grew up in a small town outside of Houston, Texas, made good grades in high school, but college just wasn’t the right fit. She moved back home but was kicked out and ended up unhoused.

“I won’t say I had it the worst, definitely not compared to some kids here; I’ve never had trouble with the law,” she said. “But before Job Corps, I honestly had nothing. I had maybe 20 bucks to my name.”

Her former boss at Subway mentioned Job Corps as a possibility for career development, but the Texas center was full up, and Lawson scraped together what she had to make her way to the Job Corps in Collbran, Colorado, a tiny town nestled in the Plateau Valley.

There she learned about iron working, welding and fabrication and eventually had her interests piqued by opportunities within the railroad sector. With the TCU/IAM heading up a hands-on program in Excelsior Springs, she ventured east to where she is today.

“We need trades, we need CNAs (certified nursing assistants), we need corrections officers, we need carmen, we need conductors, we need welders, we need these things, and they’re helping kids who, in reality, would probably be in jail or dead,” Lawson said. “They’re helping kids that had no future make something of themselves instead of working at McDonald’s, instead of working at a low-paying job.”

To start, inflation would spike incredibly fast as fuel costs pass through to all goods and services, meaning consumer spending would fall.

In turn, businesses would face “significant bankruptcies and store closings,” asone economist warnedduring a previous surge. Jobs in travel, retail and hospitality would evaporate as households juggled massive new fuel bills.

Nowimagine$20at the pump.

Each penny increase in gas already costs U.S. consumers ~$1 billion annually. A jump to $20 would add over $5,000 in fuel costs per driver, and most families simply couldn’t absorb it.

S. David Freeman, former head of the L.A. Board of Harbor Commissioners, wasn’t shywhen asked what $200-a-barrel oilwould mean for everyday Americans: “The purchasing power of the American people would be kicked in the teeth so darned hard… they won’t have the ability to buy much of anything.”

Over time, necessity would require the economy to reorganize around high transportation costs.

Vehicle miles driven would drop and telecommuting would become the norm. Housing patterns would shift towards urban, transit-accessible areas. Freight routes would shorten, favoring local production. And GDP growth would likely fall well below trend until EVs, public transit and renewable infrastructure catch up.

The auto industry would have to change dramatically.

Internal combustion (gas) vehicle sales would collapse, and EV and hybrid demand would surge. In California, EV sales respond4-6 times more to gas pricehikes than electricity price changes.

Legacy automakers would also face severe financial strain as plants focused on large vehicles would shutter, while battery and EV assembly lines race to keep up. In turn, supply chains for batteries and rare minerals would most certainly bottleneck.

Freight companies would pass on fuel surcharges or cut routes. Ocean shipping increases would be comparable to a 15% tariff on imports and global supply chains would shrink.

Jet fuel costs would ground flights and raise fares which would mean routes would be slashed and air travel demand would collapse.

On the ground, public transit ridership from buses to trains, would soar.

With household budgets gutted, non-essentials would suffer. Consumer spending would tank, and small businesses would eventually close.

Farmers would face skyrocketing diesel and fertilizer prices. Food costs would rise sharply, worsening inflation.

Tax holidays, SPR releases or gas rebates would offer only minor relief. Long-term, you could expect big public spending on EV tax credits, electric buses, transit infrastructure and renewable energy. Governments might ease drilling rules but also ramp up conservation campaigns and fuel efficiency mandates.

High gas prices in the U.S. would also have a ripple effect globally.

Oil exporters would enjoy windfall profits, while import-dependent countries face inflation, trade deficits and slower growth. Shipping costs would spike, food insecurity would worsen and pressure to decarbonize would intensify worldwide.

If gas prices were ever to jump to such a high amount, the impact would be detrimental to the U.S. and global economies. As industries are forced to pivot shipping and manufacturing processes, the cost of goods would jump wildly across the board making even the most basic necessities unaffordable to most people.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-megabill-could-slam-job-140000160.html,2025-07-06 15:00:00,How Trump's megabill could slam the job market,"The solid monthly job gains that the White House is touting as the “Trump effect” are in danger of fading as the president’s hardline immigration policies chip away at the supply of foreign-born workers.

That risk is rising because the GOP's “Big, Beautiful Bill” contains $150 billion to ramp up border security and deportations.

The foreign-born workforce contracted again in June, the government reported Thursday, marking the third straight month it has fallen even as employersdefied expectations and added 147,000 overall jobs.

White House officials insist that the decline won't dent the economy becausethe megabillwill encourage more Americans to enter the workforce. Many economists disagree, predicting that the immigration crackdown will hurt the labor market.

Now, as President Donald Trump's deportations start to show up in the economic data, we're about to find out who's right.

Economists believe that the labor market’s breakeven rate — the number of jobs that businesses must add to keep unemployment in check — will decline with the abrupt end of the Biden-era immigration surge. Even if the jobless rate stays near its current level of 4.1 percent, a slowdown in payroll growth would pose a hurdle for the economy, they say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is among those recently warning that economic growth could diminish.

“If the job market slows, then we should expect economic growth to follow,” said Daniel Zhao, the lead economist and senior manager at Glassdoor's economic research team.

Trump and top administration officials attribute the labor market’s expansion under President Joe Biden to an unchecked flow of undocumented immigrants across the Southern border. Trump has made reversing that tide a centerpiece of his second term, ordering politically explosive Immigration and Customs Enforcement workplace raids and planning new detention centers and more border control. On Tuesday, he toured a Florida holding facility for undocumented immigrants dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

“We need more agents to arrest them. We need more beds to hold them. And we need more transportation contracts to move them out of the country,” Trump’sborder czar, Tom Homan,said earlier this week. “This bill is going to give us more resources to do more of the great things the Trump administration is doing.”

So far, those immigration policies haven’t sapped the strength of the labor market. But there are signs that a pipeline of workers that has been critical to U.S. employers is starting to weaken.The sizeandshare of the foreign-born workforcehave dropped since Trump’s return to office. Law enforcement encounters with migrants at the Southwest border — a statistic that’s often used as a proxy for undocumented immigration levels —have cratered.

Stephen Miran, Trump’s top economist and the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, rejects the consensus, saying in an interview that there’s an ample supply of native-born workers to pick up the slack. The unemployment rate for workers between the ages of 20 and 24 is north of 8 percent — roughly double the national average — and more than 14 percent of working-age teenagers are unemployed.

Major elements of the president’s tax bill, including eliminating taxes on overtime, are intended to boost the supply of available labor, Miran added. And the labor pool could also see gains if the legislation pushes unemployed — or underemployed — individuals on Medicaid back into the workforce.

“It's a fallacy to think that we have no domestic substitute for immigrants,” Miran said. “There's plenty of labor supply waiting to be brought in by the right incentives for firms to hire them — and for them to work — but they'll never come in if you just provide an infinite flood of non-Americans willing to work for slave wages.”

Still, Deutsche Bank economists told clients this week that dwindling immigration could push the breakeven rate down to as low as 50,000 jobs per month. That estimate is in line with what Labor Department officials believe is necessary to keep the unemployment rate from rising,and well below the massive nonfarm payroll totals that some economists assumed were necessary to keep pacewith the expanding immigrant population under Biden.

Slower employment growth also implies that the economy can’t expand as quickly without overheating. And the “underlying demographics aren't favorable,” Aditya Bhave, a senior U.S. economist and managing director at Bank of America, told reporters on Tuesday. If immigration tails off, “where are the people going to come from to do the jobs?”

Miran acknowledged that uncertainty around the administration’s policies could lead to “weaker numbers for a period of time.” But the CEA chair said he “would not see such weakness as indicative of a deep underlying problem in the economy.”

Nevertheless, many economists say immigrant workers are critical to offsettingthe effects of an aging domestic population. Even while the labor force participation and unemployment rates for younger adults both improved during Trump’s first term, it’s far from clear whether that would adequately account for demographic challenges that are expected to arise if net migration slows to a trickle.

Population growth is expected to ease in the coming decades,according to the Congressional Budget Office. A separate2024 analysisby the nonpartisan federal agency estimated that the post-pandemic jump in immigration would have a positive effect on economic output — albeit with lower average wage growth — while leaving inflation virtually unchanged.

The right-leaning American Enterprise Institute published research on Wednesday projecting that net migration to the U.S. could flatline — or decline — in 2025, which it saidwould shave 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points from gross domestic product. And Trump himself noted recently that he’sconcerned about how the recent crackdowncould affect farmers and hospitality businesses.

Fed chief Powell has identified immigration-related declines in the labor force as a potential obstacle to future growth.

“When you significantly slow the growth of the labor force, you will slow the growth of the economy,”the Fed Chair told lawmakers last month.

“It’s not for us to have a view on immigration policy,” he added. “Growth will slow — and actually is slowing — and that’s one of the reasons.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/she-accused-fleecing-3-6-090000763.html,2025-07-06 15:45:00,She’s accused of fleecing $3.6 million from Jackson Foundation. Here is what we know,"Charmaine Gatlin was on her way to becoming the top executive of Jackson Health Foundation, the fundraising arm of Miami-Dade County’s public hospital system.

She received high marks on her evaluations as the nonprofit’s chief operating officer and was described by her bosses as a “highly ethical” leader.

“I always do things for the betterment of the foundation,” Gatlin wrote in her 2021 evaluation. Two years later, she said in another evaluation that she was “refining and enhancing my skills so that I can lead as President/CEO when the time comes.”

In late October, Gatlin’s rising star imploded. She was put on paid administrative leave while an internal investigation “related to potential misconduct” got underway. In early November, she was “terminated for cause” by the Foundation’s chairman. Her termination letter, obtained by the Miami Herald, did not elaborate.

Her abrupt dismissal led to an FBI probe and a shocking revelation in May: Gatlin, 52, a Foundation executive over the past decade,was arrestedon charges of fleecing $3.6 million from her former employer, fabricating fake invoices from vendors and receiving $1 million in kickbacks from them. She used the money to buy Louis Vuitton and Gucci goods, including a Vuitton bag for $4,350, and had a $15,617 rose gold golf cart delivered to her Weston home, court records show.

Her alleged defrauding of the Jackson Health Foundation, however, extended well beyond Miami, according to an indictment. It stretched all the way to Atlanta, where an unnamed “audiovisual company” and a “co-conspirator” suspected of collaborating with Gatlin submitted $2 million in “false and fraudulent” invoices to the Foundation for purported services that were instead provided to a civic organization in Georgia’s capital, the indictment says.

While the indictment doesn’t identify the company or the co-conspirator, the Herald has learned from multiple sources that Gatlin allegedly schemed with Yergan Jones, the CEO of American Sound Design in Atlanta.

Public records obtained by the Herald show Jones’ company submitted dozens of invoices to the Jackson Health Foundation that Gatlin approved between 2019 and 2024.

The indictment alleges the company’s invoices were for “audiovisual services that did not occur” at Jackson Health System or the Foundation. Instead, the Herald has confirmed those services were provided by Jones’ company to the civic organization in Atlanta, which is 100 Black Men of America, with chapters nationwide including South Florida.

The indictment further alleges that half of the Foundation’s $2 million payments to the audiovisual company were “returned” by the co-conspirator, Jones, to Gatlin’s personal bank account. And “to conceal the kickbacks,” the indictment says, they “created false invoices making it appear as though Gatlin did ‘event management’ for the audiovisual company events” at Jackson Health System or the Foundation.

Both Gatlin’s defense lawyer, David Howard, and Jones’ defense lawyer, Hector Flores, declined to comment. Gatlin pleaded not guilty to multiple conspiracy and fraud charges in mid-June in Miami federal court. Jones did not respond to an emailed inquiry by the Herald, and he has not been charged in the case.

David Zambrana, president and chief operating officer of Jackson Health System, recently told its governing board that Jackson “terminated the employees believed to be involved” in Gatlin’s alleged scheme. He did not say how many were fired nor did he identify them.

Jackson Health System spokesperson Krysten Brenlla declined to provide more details, saying Jackson “will not be commenting on ongoing criminal proceedings.”

In a statement, the 100 Black Men of America said it was not aware of Gatlin’s alleged false invoice and payment kickback scheme with Jones and his audiovisual company, including billing the Jackson Health Foundation for services that his firm instead provided to the Atlanta organization.

Jones provided those services to the youth mentoring group for its annual conferences between 2019 and 2024 under a different audiovisual company, American Electronic Entertainment, aka, AEE Productions, 100 Black Men of America confirmed.

In fact, 100 Black Men of America said it directly paid Jones’ company more than $500,000 for his work, but the organization did not provide details of the payments.

“100 Black Men of America, Inc. has no knowledge of Ms. Gatlin’s alleged receipt of cash payments or fraudulent invoices being submitted by Ms. Gatlin or any other vendors in the indictment involving Jackson Health Foundation,” the organization said in the statement provided to the Herald, adding that “Gatlin has never been paid by the 100 BMOA as a ‘go-between’ to then pay vendors for services provided to 100 BMOA.”

Gatlin had worked for 100 Black Men of America from 2009 to 2014 before Jackson’s Foundation hired her a decade ago. During her tenure at Jackson, she continued to work with the Atlanta organization as an unpaid volunteer. After the Foundation dismissed Gatlin last November, 100 Black Men of America hired her in January as a contractor for its annual conference in 2025 —but fired her in May when the organization said it learned about her indictment.

“We are fully cooperating with law enforcement and will continue to do so until this matter is concluded,” the organization said.

Atlanta lawyer Ronald Freeman, who represents Jones’ company, AEE Productions, which provided services to 100 Black Men of America, said it was not the audiovisual company referenced in the Gatlin indictment. In a statement, he said: “We remain confident that the legal process will fairly and accurately determine the facts.”

Gatlin, a University of Florida graduate with a bachelor’s degree in French, was arrested on May 21 in a town near Savannah where she now lives. The indictment, filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Young, charged her with a single count of conspiring with other individuals to commit wire fraud, 26 counts of wire fraud and five counts of money laundering. If convicted, the charges carry sentences that could send her to prison for years.

Gatlin is accused of authorizing Jackson Health Foundation funds to pay not only Jones’ audiovisual company in Atlanta but also a store that sold designer goods and an event planning company in South Florida that created videos, a website and other services for a family member’s softball team in Broward County, the indictment says.

She’s also accused of using the Foundation’s money to buy school supplies that were delivered to a church in Riceboro, Georgia, where she lives with her husband.

After her arrest, Gatlin was granted a $30,000 bond. Court records show that one of theconditions of her bondwas not to contact four contractors, including Jones, who “were paid” by the Jackson Health Foundation based on “purported invoices for goods and services approved by” Gatlin, according to the indictment.

By far, Gatlin’s dealings with Jones dominated her alleged criminal activity, the Herald has learned from sources and court records.

Jones’ company, American Sound Design, submitted about 40 invoices to the Foundation that Gatlin approved between 2019 and 2024 for services that his firm says were provided to the Jackson Health Foundation, according to financial documents obtained by the Herald through a public records request.

But Jones is better known as the president of AEE Productions, which on its website claims to have done business for major corporations, such as Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines and Walmart, along with NASCAR and 100 Black Men of America. The Jackson Health Foundation was also one of its clients, according to a testimonial by Gatlin, the Foundation’s former COO.

“Working with AEE Productions is always an exciting time for me. They listen to my ideas and help me create ‘the wow’ that I am looking for during each event,” reads an online testimonial by Gatlin on AEE Productions’ website. “I have been working with Yergan and his team for over 15 years and each event is better than the last one.”

In the aftermath of her arrest, AEE’s website is no longer active.

Financial records obtained by the Herald show the Jackson Health Foundation received millions of dollars worth of invoices ranging from $5,900 to $81,500 each from Jones’ company. American Sound Design claimed in those bills that it provided lighting, sound, staging and production management services for events at Jackson Health System or the Foundation, the invoices show.

But the Gatlin indictment says that Jones’ company, though not identified by name, never provided any of these services. And it’s unclear from the indictment how many of these events hosted by the Foundation even took place.

One American Sound Design invoice for $5,900 was billed to the Jackson Health Foundation for services that Jones’ company purportedly provided at the Foundation’s annual “Guardian Angel” luncheon at the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne in November 2018. The event, which featured a runway fashion show and a performance by Grammy-nominated recording artist Flo-Rida,raised over $500,000to support the pediatric neurosurgery program at Holtz Children Hospital, part of Jackson Health System.

The Herald has confirmed the event happened. But the indictment says Jones’ company provided no services.

Another American Sound Design invoice for $30,250 was billed to the Foundation for a “back-to-school block party” that was held at Gibson Charter School in the Overtown Youth Center in August 2019. Academica, which operates the charter school, did not respond to the Herald’s attempts to verify if Jones’ company provided services for the event.

Gatlin, who was described as “future CEO” in one of her earlier evaluations, managed the Jackson Health Foundation’s day-to-day operations while it transitioned several years ago into its current leadership structure, where the president’s job was split between Gatlin and co-president and chief development officer Flavia Llizo.

In 2023, Gatlin had an “extensive discussion” with Ana Milton and David Coulson, members of the Foundation’s volunteer board, and was given a salary increase and bonus, according to her most recent evaluation. The Foundation’s executive committee approved the raise. Gatlin’s yearly salary as the Foundation’s chief operating officer rose to about $300,000 in 2024.

When Gatlin was put on administrative paid leave last fall, Llizo became the Foundation’s CEO.

After Gatlin’s firing and the subsequent scandal, the Jackson Health Foundation now has a “Proceed with Caution” label on the website of Charity Navigator, a nonprofit that rates U.S. charities on a variety of measures, including stability, efficiency and sustainability to help people with their donation decisions.

The charity rater references Miami Herald and South Florida Sun Sentinel reporting as the reason for the warning.

The month-long investigation and subsequent firing of Gatlin in November came after Jackson Health System discovered a“misappropriation of funds”while “restructuring” the Foundation’s leadership last year to develop stronger oversight and accountability, according to Zambrana, president and COO of Jackson Health System.

Zambrana told the Public Health Trust during its May 28 meeting that the health system had “fully cooperated” with the investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s office.

New safeguards, including additional “financial controls and administrative oversight,” are now in place over the Foundation and Jackson has “terminated the employees believed to be involved,” he said.

“The allegations of money stolen from the public’s health system are egregious, and we are all still reeling from the profound breach of trust and the impact it has on our team, our community and the many people who support Jackson,” Zambrana said, noting that “integrity is non-negotiable.”

“We will not allow this incident to jeopardize its reputation or its momentum.”"

Alerts were upgraded at 3:35 a.m. and 4:03 a.m., the latter warning of a ""particularly dangerous situation"" and urging residents to get to higher ground immediately.

KTRK-TV Meteorologist Travis Herzog said in his Facebook post that he was ""born and raised"" in Texas Hill Country, the term he used for the area affected by the deadly flash floods, and he noted that floods have ""always been a part of life"" for residents.

Herzog explained broadly causative ""naturally-occurring rainstorms that stall out are infrequent but not unprecedented"" for the area, leading into what is a hallmark of extreme weather.

As Herzog observed, the underlying rainfall and flooding were common for the region.

What was new was their severity, strength, and sudden onset. As temperatures rise andoceans heat, atmospheric changes have a compounding effect on extreme weather, increasing its severity, its frequency, and the deadly risks it poses.

Herzog described the relationship between higher-than-average temperatures and the deadly Texas floods as ""pretty simple"" in terms of physics.

""Warmer oceans release more moisture into the atmosphere, and warmer air also holds more moisture. This enhances rainfall amounts above and beyond what would happen in a cooler world with cooler oceans,"" he explained.

Meteorologists in the United States openly fretted after abrupt, drastic cuts hit the NWS, NOAA, and FEMA as hurricane season began, and Herzog weighed in on that issue.

""It certainly didn't help the situation that the Austin/San Antonio NWS weather forecast office is understaffed by 22% and without a Warning Coordination Meteorologist, but I see no evidence yet that it hurt the situation either with what I know,"" he said.

On Monday, July 7, rescuers continued theirsearchfor those still missing in the wake of the flooding, with at least 104 confirmed dead and at least 11 still missing.

Much of the region remained under an ""extended flood watch,"" with several inches of rain expected that night.

The Pentagonsaid that at Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending ""additional defensive weapons to Ukraine so it can defend itself, ""while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.""

""Our framework for POTUS to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities,"" it said.

The Department of Defense did not reveal the details of the planned defensive aid to Ukraine that came after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reportedly ordered weapons deliveries to Kyiv to halt, citing concerns over the U.S. military stockpile.

The statement came hours after Trumptold reportersduring a dinner at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Ukraine was in need of weapons.

""We're going to send more weapons. We have to,"" Trump said.

""They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now. They're getting hit very hard. We're going to have to send more weapons, your defensive weapons, primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in that mess.""

Trump, who campaigned heavily on being able to end the Ukraine-Russia war within 24 hours of returning to the White House, has been seeking to secure a cease-fire deal, while his pause of weapons deliveries to Ukraine occurred as the Kremlin was hammering its neighbor with air barrages.

The future of U.S. support was uncertain under the Trump administration, as Trump has been critical of sending weaponry to the country and is known for praising Putin.

On returning to office on Jan. 20, the administration proclaimed that an end to the war would not see Ukraine return to its old borders, an announcement that was criticized as a capitulation to Russia.

Last week when asked about the decision to halt some weaponry to Ukraine, Trump responded by blaming his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for having ""emptied out our whole country"" of weapons.

""We have to have enough for ourselves,"" he said.

A second federal district judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate AmeriCorps workers who were laid off without notice in April and to restore $400 million in funding and grants to nonprofit organizations.

Thepreliminary injunctionhanded down Monday by District Judge Matthew Maddox comes a month and two days after a similar ruling in a separate AmeriCorps case in Maryland by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman — whose ruling is quoted heavily by Maddox.

Both judges blocked moves by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to shut down AmeriCorps programs, including the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and various state and private grant programs.

Boardman ruledin favor of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued to block the DOGE cuts. Maddox ruled in favor of a number of nonprofits from around the country, members of an AmeriCorps labor union and three AmeriCorps service members.

Both cases were a response to DOGE moves in mid-April to immediately terminate all NCCC projects, along with 2,000 NCCC participants, and to put more than 600 AmeriCorps staffers — about 85% of the agency’s staff — on administrative leave, to be laid off less than two weeks later. Workers were ordered to immediately stop working and were locked out of AmeriCorps offices, email and other systems.

About $80,000 raised to support Maryland AmeriCorps programs gutted by Trump

Maddox said the workers and nonprofits that sued the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs AmeriCorps, were likely to win on their claims that the abrupt government cuts were made without authority, failed to follow appropriate procedures and were likely to cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.

Maddox wrote that the government “cancelled approximately $400 million in AmeriCorps grants and terminated funding to both direct grantees and subgrantees of State Service Commission…. These actions have led to significant disruptions in the delivery of services that were previously funded by AmeriCorps and provided by the Nonprofit Plaintiffs.”

“This disruption has included the termination or suspension of assistance with college applications, provision of teachers to Indigenous school districts, housing assistance for low-income families, childhood literacy programs, summer and afterschool learning programs, and neighborhood revitalization programs, among other services,” he wrote.

Maddox orderedthe return of roughly $400 million in funding to 14 nonprofits that had grants to do AmeriCorps work, the reinstatement of hundreds of AmeriCorps Employees Union Local 2027 members who were put on administrative leave on April 15 and subsequently laid off, and the return of three AmeriCorps members who lost their positions as a result of the cuts.

Boardman had ordered much of the same in herJune 5 order.

Besides Maryland and Washington, D.C., other states that sued, and are subject to Boardman’s preliminary injunction, are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Maddox’s order affects three unnamed AmeriCorps members as well as about 400 members of AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027. It also applies to 14 nonprofits: Elev8 in Baltimore; Red Cloud Indian School in South Dakota; Bur Oak Land Trust in Iowa; Partners for Campus-Community Engagement in Pennsylvania; National College Attainment Network in Washington, D.C.; Michigan College Access Network; North Carolina Housing Coalition; Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey; Handson Suburban Chicago; Democracy Maine; the Service Collaborative of WNY in New York; Rainbow Labs in California; the SEED Coalition in Minnesota; and the Aspire Afterschool Learning in Virginia.

Maddox gave the government 24 hours to file a status report confirming that all parties had been notified of his order and that the government was complying with it. It is to file an updated status report every two weeks."

The weather service states, “Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.”

“Numerous showers and thunderstorms will develop late this afternoon and persist into part of the evening. The strongest storms will be capable of producing torrential rainfall in a very short period of time. The potential exists for some locales to receive 1′ to 2′ of rain in an hour. This will result in the potential for localized flash flooding, particularly if this were to occur over a vulnerable urban center,” comments the weather service. “You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flash Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.”

Flash flood warning: Take action!

A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it’s crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall.

Flood warning: Take action!

A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring.

Flood advisory: Be aware:

A flood advisory is released when flooding is not expected to reach a severity level necessitating a warning. Nonetheless, it can still cause considerable inconvenience and, without exercising caution, potentially lead to situations that threaten life and/or property.

Flood watch: Be prepared:

A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn’t guarantee that flooding will occur, but it signifies that the possibility exists.

In flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver:

Seek higher ground:

If you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.

Adhere to evacuation orders:

When local authorities issue an evacuation order, promptly comply. Before leaving, secure your home by locking it.

Disconnect utilities and appliances:

If time permits, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This precaution minimizes electrical hazards during flooding.

Avoid basements and submerged areas:

Avoid basements or rooms submerged in water with electrical outlets or cords. Preventing electrical accidents is crucial.

Swift evacuation for your safety:

If you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping sounds, evacuate without delay. Do not enter water that may carry an electrical charge.

Refrain from walking in floodwaters:

Never attempt to walk through floodwaters. Even just 6 inches of swiftly moving water can forcefully knock you off your feet.

Seek high ground if trapped:

In the event you become trapped by moving water, make your way to the highest point available and contact emergency services by calling 911.

During heavy rain, flooding is possible, especially in low-lying and flood-prone areas. Never drive through water on the road, even if it does not appear to be deep. It takes just 12 inches of rushing water to carry away most cars, according to the weather service. Stay safe by being prepared and informed.

When heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here’s your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours:

Beware of swollen waterways:

Avoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Slow down and stay cautious:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.

Visibility matters:

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Don’t follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Heavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas.

If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center laid off the staff of its LGBTQ Health Program in late June, effectively shuttering a resource that helped LGBTQ+ people access and navigate healthcare for the last decade.

Members of the institution’s LGBTQ Health Community Advisory Board and a former member of the program’s office staff say VUMC quietly eliminated the office and its Trans Buddy program on June 24 with no notice to the community or the patients served by the program’s resources.

Instead, the Community Advisory Board learned of the layoffs from affected employees and shared the information along with an open letter to VUMC administratorson social media.

The layoffs did not impact medical staff at VUMC’s Vivid Health Clinic, which continues to offer medical care, according to Community Advisory Board Chair Ray Holloman and Dahron Johnson, the board’s immediate past chair.

Spokespeople for VUMC did not respond to multiple requests for comment or detailed questions about the staff terminations. VUMC previously issued a statement on June 30 confirming that it expects to lay off650 research, administrative and support employeesdue to grant and funding cuts made by the Trump Administration.

The news spurred the Metro Council of Nashville’s LGBTQ Caucus to publish a letter to the health organization on July 1, expressing its “deep disappointment” in VUMC’s “pattern of decisions — both actions and inactions — that have left a once-loyal community feeling misled, abandoned, and deeply betrayed.”

Caucus members cited VUMC’s 2022 pause of gender-affirming surgeries for minors, 2023 release of transgender patients’ medical records to the Tennessee Attorney General, April 2025 elimination of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs and the institution’s withdrawal of medical support from the 2025 Nashville Pride Festival as reasons for the caucus’ statement of no confidence in VUMC leadership.

“This is not about red tape or resources. This is about values. Each of these moments was a chance to show conviction. Instead, you revealed where your priorities lie,” the caucus letter states. “You failed us. You stood on our backs as we lifted you up. You benefitted from our trust, our pride, and our presence. And when we needed you most, you betrayed us. We will not forget.”

Johnson, a transgender woman who graduated from Vanderbilt Divinity School in 2008 and has gone on to become a chaplain and serve on multiple community boards, described the LGBTQ Health Program’s abrupt closure as a betrayal of VUMC’s clinical promises to put patients’ needs first.

“There is no hiding the fact that (the LGBTQ+ community) have been targeted in the ways we’ve been targeted,” Johnson said. “When you offer care, we as patients, as a community, are looking for you to stand by the thing that you have willingly, openly committed yourself to. This type of last-second, in-the-middle-of-the-night closure is just absolutely reprehensible and an utter dereliction of the basics of care, whether that’s (for) trans folks or any other type of person.”

LGBTQ CAUCUS_LETTER TO VUMC_2025

Quinn Bacon was preparing to train her replacement as coordinator for VUMC’s Trans Buddy program when she was told the position was eliminated, effective June 30 – the last day of Pride Month.

Bacon, a transgender woman, started in the role in January 2023, ensuring that the program’s phone line was staffed 12 hours each day to answer questions about resources, community, safety, and more. People could also call the line to request a “Trans Buddy” — one of the volunteers trained by Bacon — to accompany them to any appointment at any VUMC location for support.

“There were times that patients were put in unsafe situations or were experiencing medical neglect, and by having a Trans Buddy there to provide community support while also advocating for them to be treated fairly in the hospital, we were able to help people get what they needed and feel humanized at the same time,” Bacon said.

She planned to leave in August upon completing graduate school. Bacon, her boss and her predecessors believed the role was a part-time federal work study position, she said. While she could not continue work study, she planned to keep volunteering with the program.

During a call with VUMC Human Resources staff in late June, Bacon found out she’d lost her job, and she wouldn’t be offered any severance because the role was classified as temporary, she said. (VUMC’s June 30 statement said it would provide severance and other assistance to affected employees).

It’s become very hard to have a lot of trust in this mammoth institution that has been kind of a pillar in the community for forever, and now just kind of see them say, ‘You know what? We are going to back away from everything. We’re not going to try to fight.

– Ray Holloman, LGBTQ Health Program Community Advisory Board Chair

The HR team was at first unaware that she still worked at VUMC, and didn’t know she was still a student, despite her work badge identifying her as a student worker, she said.

They also told her the position was not, in fact, paid through work study. Bacon said she thought of the opportunities she’d passed on in order to stay eligible for the coordinator position — a fellowship she turned down when she found out it was funded through federal work study, and her library job she had to quit “because I was told that the Trans Buddy program maxes out my hours.”

VUMC representatives did not respond to questions about Bacon’s termination.

The end of the Trans Buddy program is also personal for Johnson, who called the program’s number in early 2020 after having her own “now or never” moment, Johnson said. The person she spoke with helped her connect with clinical providers and informed her on routes to set up a visit. That person was one of the people who lost their job in June, Johnson said.

A call to the Trans Buddy phone number Monday rang through to an error message after multiple rings.

Johnson said the LGBTQ Health Program office and the Trans Buddy program also served as a sort of clearinghouse for LGBTQ resources at VUMC, an entry point and navigator for patients seeking care and a source of education for hospital services and providers.

Holloman said the office staff provided awareness training to “ensure that if trans or queer people are interacting with these staff, they don’t get misgendered, they’re looking at their records, they push to get gender identity and sexual orientation and legal sex and all of these things into the health record so that people would feel comfortable coming there.”

Bacon said patients planning to go to VUMC now “should plan to bring people with them that they want to protect them. They should not expect that the hospital will provide people that will do that sort of advocacy work.”

The Trans Buddy program and gender-affirming care were part of theTennessee Office of the Attorney General’s demand for documents in 2023for what it said was an investigation into possible violations of the Tennessee Medicaid False Claims Act.

The demand included volunteer resumes, emails sent by members of the general public to an LGBTQ+ health questions portal and communications with outside therapists, in addition to the names of people who were referred to Vanderbilt for transgender care but opted not to pursue it. Any medical records reviewed under investigations into billing are kept confidential, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s office stated in 2023.

A VUMC spokesperson at the time stated the institution did not comply with every demand for records, without elaboration.

Patients sue Vanderbilt for releasing transgender clinic records to Tennessee AG

Several patientssued VUMC in Davidson County Chancery Courtfollowing the disclosure of their medical records. The case went into mediation on May 30 and was settled as of June 11, according to court records that do not specify the terms of the settlement.

A representative for Skrmetti’s office could not be immediately reached for comment on the result of the office’s investigation into VUMC’s billing practices for gender-related treatment.

Holloman, a transgender man who has received care through the Vivid Clinic, said administrative decisions have eroded trust in VUMC in recent years. The Community Advisory Board for the LGBTQ Health Program anticipated the program would be dismantled given “the way Vanderbilt has been trending over the last few years.”

“It’s become very hard to have a lot of trust in this mammoth institution that has been kind of a pillar in the community for forever, and now just kind of see them say, ‘You know what? We are going to back away from everything. We’re not going to try to fight,’” Holloman said.

If Holloman had a “magic wand,” rebuilding trust in the community would start with bringing back the terminated positions and the employees who filled them, but it would be a “long road,” he said.

“Trans Buddy and all of the other programs that they had made it so people could access healthcare,” Holloman said. “They are a healthcare organization … with the moves that they’ve just made, they are discouraging people now from accessing health care until it becomes an emergency.”

On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture — a century and more of Coco Chanel’s revolution in how women dress — it blew up its atelier as a giant set inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show atParis Couture Week.

Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches — from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus.

It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off — and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel'snew designer Matthieu Blazy.

Penélope Cruz, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell, Kirsten Dunst and the house’s tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel — intimate yet monumental, Old World yet futuristic.

“It just felt special,” Campbell said, “like stepping into a memory and something completely new. There’s warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works.""

Chanel goes country

More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn’s hush. Bouclé tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur.

Gold-sprayed wheat ears — the house symbol of abundance — were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest’s seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to “roughing it.”

Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lamé so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard’s abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness.

That obsessive handwork matters — not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion’s juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7 billion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world’s most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals.

New era for the luxury giant

Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais.After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era.

Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft.

Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: “He’s focused, open-minded — he’ll bring something special.”

Tuesday’s show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d’Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multiyear restoration co-funded by Chanel. It’s more than a venue; it’s an advertisement of the house’s power and commitment to Parisian heritage."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/genetics-not-just-parenting-skills-160521855.html,2025-07-08 16:45:00,"Genetics, not just parenting skills, decide how long your baby cries","How much a baby torments its parents with its cries is determined by its genes and not just parenting techniques, new research has shown.

After a study on hundreds of twins, a team of scientists in Sweden has concluded that how long a baby cries for is largely determined by genetic factors and not only its wellbeing.

The child's sleep quality and ability to be soothed during its first few months are also influenced by genetic predisposition.

""For parents, it may be a comfort to know that their child’s crying is largely explained by genetics, and that they themselves have limited options to influence how much their child cries,"" said study leader Charlotte Viktorsson from Uppsala University in Sweden.

The team's analysis is based on questionnaires completed by the parents of 998 same-sex identical or fraternal twins when the children were two months and five months old.

Among other things, the parents were asked how long the children cried, how often they woke up at night, and how long it took to calm them down. Twins were chosen because they share key factors such as the home environment, family situation and socioeconomic status, which also influence crying behaviour.

Identical twins develop from a single egg cell and therefore have identical genetic material (DNA), while fraternal twins are as genetically different as siblings born in different years. If identical twins are more similar in a particular trait than fraternal twins, we can infer that genetics play a role in the expression of that trait.

On average, more than an hour of crying every day

The survey revealed immense individual differences. For example, some children woke up as many as 10 times a night, while others almost never did.

On average, the twins cried for about 72 minutes daily at the age of two months, woke up more than twice a night and took about 20 minutes to calm down each time. By the age of five months, the average crying duration had decreased to 47 minutes, but the twins still woke up twice a night and took about 14 minutes to calm down.

However, it should be noted that a ""sibling effect"" may come into play: If one twin starts crying, the other often joins in. If both cry, it can take longer for them to calm down.

The clearest evidence for a predominantly genetic basis was found for the duration of crying. At the age of two months, genetics explained about 50% of how much the children cried, according to the study published in the journal JCPP Advances. By the age of five months, this figure had risen to 70%.

The number of night-time awakenings, however, was found to be far less influenced by genetics. Factors such as sleep routines and the environment in which the child sleeps could play a more significant role, the researchers suggested. However, the study does not allow conclusions to be drawn about particularly effective methods for addressing these issues.

When it comes to soothing, the environment appears to have a strong influence only in the first months of life. By the age of five months, the ability to be soothed was primarily determined by genetics, according to the survey data.

The researchers acknowledged limitations, noting that the data is based on parental reports and may not accurately reflect sleep and behaviour. Additionally, the results cannot automatically be applied to single children due to the interaction between twins and the higher demands placed on parents by having two babies. Both factors influence the measured outcomes.

However, an initial sample found no significant differences between twins and single children in terms of crying and soothing behaviour, although there were differences in the number of awakenings. Interestingly, twins woke up less frequently than single children.

The researchers did not explore potential reasons for this unexpected difference. It is possible that a baby feels more secure when its ever-present twin is sleeping nearby, or that it is less easily startled by night-time noises due to its busy environment.

How to soothe a crying baby in 13 minutes

Some time ago, another research team investigated how to calm babies most quickly and developed a minute-by-minute guide.

Parents were told to hold their crying child close to their body and walk at an even pace for about five minutes, avoiding abrupt movements, the researchers explained in the journal Current Biology. Once the baby has fallen asleep, parents should sit with the child for about eight minutes before laying it down to sleep.

The team also provided an explanation for the calming effect of walking: the so-called transport response. This innate effect is observed in many young mammals, such as mice and monkeys that are not yet able to care for themselves. The young animals calm down and their heart rate decreases when they are picked up and carried."

* I still have no idea why the Department of Homeland Security launched an unnecessary operationat MacArthur Park: “Federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out around a mostly empty Los Angeles park in a largely immigrant neighborhood on foot, horseback and military vehicles on Monday for about an hour before abruptly leaving, an operation that local officials said seemed designed to sow fear.”

* For the record, a total of30,000 layoffsis better than the original 83,000 layoffs, but it’s still a lot: “The Department of Veterans Affairs said Monday that it will no longer be forced to conduct a large reduction in workforce, unlike several other federal agencies that were forced to make mass layoffs because of the Trump administration’s U.S. DOGE Service.”

* It’s now OK tokeep your shoeson at some airports’ security lines: “The Transportation Safety Administration will allow passengers at selected airports to keep their footwear on as they go through security checkpoints, a senior government official tells NBC News. People in screening lanes will have to keep their shoes on at selected airports, but the source said the relaxation of the rules could expand nationwide in the near future.”

* Some welcome newsout of Minnesota: “The Minnesota state senator who, along with his wife, was among the first victims in a June shooting spree that took the life of a fellow lawmaker was released from intensive care. Sen. John Hoffman is out of a hospital intensive care unit, his wife, Yvette Hoffman, who was released five days after she was treated for injuries sustained in the June 14 attack, [officials] confirmed Monday.”

“I hated my body,” the nonbinary 16-year-old said. “I hated looking at it.”

When therapy didn't help, Pitchenik, who uses the pronoun they, started going to the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the country’s biggest public provider ofgender-affirming carefor children and teens. It changed their life.

But in response to the Trump administration’sthreat to cut federal fundsto places that offer gender-affirming care to minors, the center will be closing its doors July 22. Pitchenik has been among the scores of protesters who have demonstrated regularly outside the hospital to keep it open.

“Trans kids are done being quiet. Trans kids are done being polite, and trans kids are done begging for the bare minimum, begging for the chance to grow up, to have a future, to be loved by others when sometimes we can’t even love ourselves,” Pitchenik said, prompting cheers from dozens of protesters during a recent demonstration.

They went to the center for six years.

“There’s a lot of bigotry and just hate all around, and having somebody who is trained specifically to speak with you, because there’s not a lot of people that know what it’s like, it meant the world,” they told The Associated Press.

The center's legacy

In operation for three decades, the facility is among the longest-running trans youth centers in the country and has served thousands of young people on public insurance.

Patients who haven't gone through puberty yet receive counseling, which continues throughout the care process. For some patients, the next step ispuberty blockers; for others, it’s also hormone replacement therapy. Surgeries are rarely offered to minors.

“I’m one of the lucky ones,” said Pitchenik, who received hormone blockers after a lengthy process. “I learned how to not only survive but how to thrive in my own body because of the lifesaving health care provided to me right here at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.”

Many families are now scrambling to find care among a patchwork of private and public providers that are already stretched thin. It’s not just patient care, but research development that’s ending.

“It is a disappointment to see this abrupt closure disrupting the care that trans youth receive. But it’s also a stain on their legacy,” said Maria Do, community mobilization manager at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. “I think it showcases that they’re quick to abandon our most vulnerable members.”

The closure comes weeks after theSupreme Court upheldTennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, amid other efforts by the federal government to regulate the lives of transgender people.

The hospital initially backed off its plans to close after announcing them in February, spurring demonstrations, but later doubled back.

The center said in a statement that “despite this deeply held commitment to supporting LA’s gender-diverse community, the hospital has been left with no viable path forward” to stay open.

“Center team members were heartbroken to learn of the decision from hospital leaders, who emphasized that it was not made lightly, but followed a thorough legal and financial assessment of the increasingly severe impacts of recent administrative actions and proposed policies,” the statement said.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta haswarnedthat by closing the center, the hospital is violating state antidiscrimination laws, but his office hasn't taken any further action. Bonta and attorneys general from 22 other states suedPresident Donald Trump's administration over the executive order in February.

“The Trump administration’s relentless assault on transgender adolescents is nothing short of an all-out war to strip away LGBTQ+ rights,” Bonta told the AP in an email. “The Administration’s harmful attacks are hurting California’s transgender community by seeking to scare doctors and hospitals from providing nondiscriminatory healthcare. The bottom line is: This care remains legal in California.”

LGBTQ+ protesters and health care workers offer visibility

Still wearing scrubs, Jack Brenner joined protesters after a long shift as a nurse in the hospital’s emergency room, addressing the crowd with a megaphone while choking back tears.

“Our visibility is so important for our youth,” Brenner said, looking out at a cluster of protesters raising signs and waving trans pride flags. “To see that there is a future, and that there is a way to grow up and to be your authentic self.”

Brenner, who uses the pronoun they, didn’t see people who looked like them growing up or come to understand what being trans meant until their mid-20s.

“It's something I definitely didn’t have a language for when I was a kid, and I didn’t know what the source of my pain and suffering was, and now looking back, so many things are sliding into place,” Brenner said. “I’m realizing how much gender dysphoria was a source of my pain.”

Trans children and teens are at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, according to a 2024 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Brenner described encountering young patients in the emergency room who are trans or otherwise on the gender-nonconforming spectrum and “at the peak of a mental health crisis.” Brenner wears a lanyard teeming with colorful pins emblazoned with the words “they/them” to signal their gender identity.

“I see the change in kids’ eyes, little glints of recognition, that I am a trans adult and that there is a future,” Brenner said. “I’ve seen kids light up when they recognize something of themselves in me. And that is so meaningful that I can provide that.”

Beth Hossfeld, a marriage and family therapist and a grandmother to an 11- and 13-year-old who received care at the center, called the closure “patient abandonment.”

“It’s a political decision, not a medical one, and that’s disturbing to me,” she said."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-hosts-west-african-leaders-113047014.html,2025-07-09 12:00:00,Trump promises West African leaders a pivot to trade as the region reels from sweeping aid cuts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumppromised West African leaders a pivot from aid to trade during a White House meeting Wednesday as the region reels from the impact of sweeping U.S. aid cuts.

Trump said he sees “great economic potential in Africa” as the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau boasted of their countries' natural resources and heaped praise on the U.S. president, including their thanks for his help in settling a long-running conflict between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Trump described the nations represented at the meeting as “all very vibrant places with very valuable land, great minerals, and great oil deposits, and wonderful people” — a definite shift from his first term, when he used a vulgar term to describe African nations.

The meeting comes amid a shift in U.S. global and domestic priorities under Trump's leadership. Earlier this month, U.S. authoritiesdissolved theU.S. Agency for International Developmentand said it was no longer following what they called “a charity-based foreign aid model” and instead would focus on partnerships with nations that show “both the ability and willingness to help themselves.”

The five nations whose leaders were meeting Trump represent a small fraction of U.S.-Africa trade, but they possess untapped natural resources. Senegal and Mauritania are important transit and origin countries when it comes to migration and along with Guinea-Bissau are struggling to contain drug trafficking, both issues of concern for the Trump administration.

In their speeches, each African leader adopted a flattering tone to commend Trump for what they described as his peace efforts across the world and tried to outshine one another by listing the untapped natural resources their nations possess.

“We have a great deal of resources,” said Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, president of Mauritania, listing rare earths, as well as manganese, uranium and possibly lithium. “We have a lot of opportunities to offer in terms of investment.”

Last month, the U.S. administration facilitated a peace deal between Rwanda and Congo to help end the decadeslongdeadly fightingin eastern Congo, while enabling the U.S. to gain access to critical minerals in the region. But analysts said it won’t end the fighting because the most prominent armed group said it does not apply to it.

During the meeting, Trump described trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade “seems to be a foundation” for him to settle disputes between countries, he said.

“You guys are going to fight, we’re not going to trade,” Trump said. “And we seem to be quite successful in doing that.”

He added, addressing the African leaders: “There is a lot of anger on your continent.”

As he spoke, the U.S. administration continued sending out notifications to developing countries about higher tariff rates effective from August 1. The five Western African nations were not among them.

The portion of the lunch meeting that was open to the press didn't touch much on the loss of aid, which critics say will result in millions of deaths.

“We have closed the USAID group to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” Trump said Wednesday. “And we’re working tirelessly to forge new economic opportunities involving both the United States and many African nations.”

West African countries are among the hardest hit by the dissolution of USAID.The U.S. support in Liberiaamounted to 2.6% of the country’s gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.

Liberian President Joseph Nyuma Boakai in a statement “expressed optimism about the outcomes of the summit, reaffirming Liberia’s commitment to regional stability, democratic governance and inclusive economic growth.""

During the meeting, Trump reacted with visible surprise to Boakai's English-speaking skills, which he praised. English is the official language of Liberia, which was established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed African slaves and free-born Black citizens from the United States.

Gabon, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal are among 36 countriesthat might be included in the possible expansion of Trump's travel ban.

Experts said that the meeting highlighted the new transactional nature of the relationship between the U.S. and Africa.

“We are likely to see a trend where African countries will seek to leverage resources such as critical minerals, or infrastructure such as ports, to attract US commercial entities in order to maintain favourable relations with the current US administration,” aid Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at Control Risks, a security consulting firm. “Each of the African leaders sought to leverage natural resources in exchange for US financial and security investments, and appeared to view the U.S. intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo as a model to further cooperation.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/just-unfair-end-tps-means-093000906.html,2025-07-09 20:00:00,‘It’s just unfair’: What end of TPS means for Nicaraguans and Hondurans in the U.S.,"Virginia Guevara came to the United States from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in the 1990s, before the country was granted Temporary Protected Status following the devastating destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.

Guevara, 48 at the time, found a new and better life in the U.S. by working as a kitchen helper. Now, at 78, she faces possible deportation back to Honduras, a country she hasn’t been to in decades, after the Trump administration ended deportation protections for over 51,000 Hondurans on Monday.

Her family is now concerned about what will happen in September when TPS for Honduras officially expires. Her grandson, Isaac Dubon, is worried about what would happen to her if she’s detained in anImmigration and Customs Enforcement facility, after news reports ofmultiple deaths, including five alone in Florida.

“She is an elderly woman with high blood pressure and diabetes,” Dubon said of his grandmother, who lives in Oakland Park in Broward County.

Maria Elena Hernandez, a 67-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant, has been living and working in the U.S. for nearly 30 years with TPS. She worked as a cleaner at a university for 18 years, and two years ago, she began receiving Social Security benefits.

On Monday, Hernandez, who lives in Broward, became part of a group of 2,900 Nicaraguans who learned that the Trump administration is ending their TPS, the measure that grants deportation protection and work permits to immigrants in the U.S. from countries in turmoil. In September, she could face deportation to a country she has not been to in decades, unable to manage her two chronic diseases and separated from her family, who are U.S. citizens.

The terminations of TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua announced on Monday are set to take effect on Sept. 8.

TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua was first granted in January 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. In the years since, multiple U.S. attorneys general and Homeland Security secretaries have extended those protections due to ongoing recovery challenges, subsequent natural disasters, and worsening economic and political crises.

Hernandez is among a dozen Honduran, Nicaraguan and Nepali TPS holders who filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Monday regarding its decision to end the protections for their nationalities. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco, argues that the administration is determined to dismantle TPS entirely regardless of current real-life conditions in those countries or any legal considerations.

The nation of Nepal, also named in the lawsuit, was first designated for TPS in June 2015 following a catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of severe aftershocks that killed nearly 9,000 people and displaced millions. In June, the Trump administration announced the termination of Nepal’s TPS designation, with protections set to end on Aug. 5. Altogether, the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal will strip legal status and protections from approximately 61,000 people—51,000 from Honduras, 7,200 from Nepal, and 2,900 from Nicaragua.

“The termination of TPS is very terrifying for me. It has affected me emotionally and financially, as we would lose our jobs and our health insurance,” Hernandez said. She said that since receiving TPS, she has paid taxes and contributed both economically and culturally to the United States.

“I have lived here for over 25 years,” she added. “Now they want me to return to Nicaragua, where there are so many problems, to the point that this government recommended its citizens not to visit it.”

Florida is home to more than 40% of Nicaraguans living in the United States, including many like Hernandez, though not all are TPS holders. Many reside in the Miami area, particularly in the city of Sweetwater, often referred to as “Little Managua” for itshigh number of Nicaraguan residents.

This is the second time Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders experience uncertainty a about their fate as the Trump administration takes steps to end their protections for a second time. A similar attempt was made in 2017 during Trump’s first term, targeting those countries as well as Sudan, Haiti and El Salvador. That effort was successfully challenged in federal court. Now, eight years later, these communities are being forced to fight the same battle all over again. El Salvador’s TPS is the only deportation protection the Trump administration has not terminated, allowing the extension granted under the Biden administration to stand. A close ally in Trump-era immigration crackdowns—including the controversial deportation of Venezuelans to its mega-prison, CECOT—El Salvador remains an exception, as TPS for Venezuela, Haiti, Cameroon and Afghanistan has been ended.

Harold Rocha, president of the Nicaraguan American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said his group had anticipated the decision by the Trump administration. The organization had been part of a coalition advocating for the Biden administration to grant a new TPS designation for Nicaraguans who had recently arrived as well as those in the U.S. since 1999.

“We actively tried to get the previous administration to grant the new designation because we feared what we are seeing now was going to pass,” he said.

Rocha said the group had been close to achieving a new TPS designation, but the Biden administration instead began a new humanitarian parole program to help reduce the number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. At the time, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told his group the new designation was being put on hold so the administration could determine if the new program was being effective.

The humanitarian parole program, known as CHNV for the Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who benefited from it, allowed more than 500,000 peoplelegally came to the United States. But it was abruptly terminated mid-stream by the Trump administration.

Rocha said his organization is pivoting to educate and provide information on what to do now for Nicaraguans who may now face deportation after decades of living in the United States.

“Many of them have been active members of the communities where they lived and work. They are full members of those communities. Many of them are spouses or parents to US citizens. How do they leave that behind?” Rocha said.

The Trump administration, in its decisions to terminate TPS for multiple countries, has consistently labeled those nations as sufficiently safe for their nationals living in the U.S. to return to.

But that has contradicted the administration’s own advisories regarding U.S. citizens visiting those countries. Nicaragua and Honduras are both listed by the State Department at Travel Advisory Level 3 — “Reconsider Travel” — citing high crime rates, risks of wrongful detention and lack of fair trials. U.S. citizens face a blanket prohibition from traveling to one department in Honduras, Gracias a Dios, because of high levels of criminal activity from drug trafficking, according to the State Department advisory.

The lawsuit filed in San Francisco by the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law, the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance highlights what the groups say is a pattern repeated from the previous round of TPS terminations.

The suit says DHS Secretary Kristi Noem cited certain positive developments—such as increased tourism and real estate investment—as reasons for ending protections, while ignoring key country conditions that had previously justified TPS, including “political violence” and “staggering levels of crime.”

The 60-day timeline provided for the termination of TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans is unlawful, the lawsuit argues, because it leaves long-time TPS holders—many of whom have lived and worked legally in the United States for decades—with virtually no time to prepare for losing their legal status and employment authorization.

“The decisions to strip legal status from people who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years, and in most cases at least 25, and followed all the rules, are not just callous. It’s also illegal,” said Jessica Bansal, attorney at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. “The administration cannot manufacture a predetermined outcome without regard for its statutory obligations.”

According to the attorneys, no TPS termination in the past 20 years, including those under the first Trump administration, has provided such limited notice to individuals with long-standing protections.

Maureen Porras, the vice mayor of Doral who immigrated to the United States from Nicaragua in 1996, said she found the Trump administration decision “disheartening.” She cited the 2018 protests against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s government that led to widespread crackdowns on citizens as signs of concern for people returning to the country.

“I don’t think the socio-economic and socio-political conditions are favorable for or safe enough for these folks to return,” she said.

Republican U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Miami said in a posting Monday on X that he is“profoundly concerned for those who cannot safely return to Nicaraguadue to the dangers they are likely to face.” He called on the Trump administration to reconsider its TPS decision the Central American nation.

“For years, the Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo regime has deprived the Nicaraguan people of their fundamental freedoms, forcing thousands into exile in numerous countries, including the United States,” his comment on X said.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said on X on Monday that the decision to end TPS for both countries is“a heartbreaking setback”for hundreds of thousands of immigrants across the country, including many in Miami-Dade.

“For decades, TPS holders from Honduras and Nicaragua have lived and worked here under lawful protection, helping to strengthen our economy and enrich our society,” she said. “Forcing them to return to nations still struggling with widespread insecurity and instability is both inhumane and counterproductive.”

Miami-Dade County Commissioner Marleine Bastien called on Congress to pass legislation to grant permanency to families with TPS.

“Once again, this abrupt and shortsighted reversal puts families at risk of separation and creates unnecessary fear and instability in cities like ours, where TPS recipients are vital members of the workforce and economy,” Bastien said in a statement.

Bastien’s concerns are deeply personal for longtime Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders living in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, whose families now face the threat of separation and loss of stability.

Guevara’s grandson, Dubon, said his family fears she will lose all the retirement benefits she earned.

“All she ever did was work,” he said. “It’s just unfair.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/tensions-eased-arizona-grants-kane-192230479.html,2025-07-09 20:00:00,Tensions eased: Arizona grants Kane County Hospital leeway to provide ambulance service,"Kane County Hospital ambulances have more leeway to respond to emergencies in neighboring Arizona following an abrupt halt to service late last week that prompted alarm among some.

In asocial media postTuesday, Kane County officials said emergency responders from the county have received permission from Arizona authorities to service the adjacent state “in emergency situations and when Arizona resources are not available.” Nevertheless, an emergency declaration issued on Friday due to theturn of eventsby officials in Fredonia, Arizona, across the state line from Kanab, remains in effect.

Fredonia Mayor Don Johnson will lift thedeclaration“once he feels that the residents of Fredonia are no longer in danger,” Fredonia Town Clerk Tracy Stumpf said Monday in an email to leaders in the border area, supplied to KSL.com.

Emergency service responders from the Kane County Hospital in Kanab have served adjacent areas of northern Arizona — including Fredonia, other Arizona locales and even the North Rim of the Grand Canyon — for some 40 years. However, after hospital officials ran into roadblocks in securing the required permission from Arizona to serve the adjacent state, they announced a halt to service last Wednesday, worried they could face penalties from Arizona officials.

Fredonia leaders, in response, approved the emergency declaration on Friday, stating that leaders from the locale would seek emergency medical assistance “from any and all resources” if and when needed, even from Kane County Hospital. The message blasted the Arizona Department of Health Services in its dealings with Kane County Hospital emergency responders on the permitting question, saying the state agency has “imperiled the lives, health and safety” of Fredonia residents.

The tense situation seems to be thawing, though. The Arizona Department of Health Services issued a statement last week, as the concerns reached a crescendo, stating that other ambulance providers were available in northern Arizona to serve the areas typically served by Kane County responders.

Kane County Commissioner Celeste Meyers said Tuesday that the situation is “on its way to being solved.”

The issue intensified early last week after the Arizona health department announced Kane County emergency responders’ operations in Arizona violated state law because they didn’t have a “certificate of necessity,” according to the Fredonia emergency declaration. Hospital officials say they’ve been seeking certification, but have repeatedly encountered roadblocks in their dealings with Arizona authorities, though Meyers said the efforts will continue.

The Kane County Hospital is publicly owned, part of an independent special district, and is a key health care provider in the area along the Utah-Arizona state line."

Bondi has drawn criticism from far-right influencers and conservative internet personalities over the Justice Department’s abrupt refusal to release additional documents from theJeffrey Epsteinsex trafficking investigation.

Trump’s move Monday to send more weapons to Ukraine has also drawn skepticism from the MAGA base. His comments appeared to be an abrupt change in posture after the Pentagon announced last week that it would hold back delivering to Ukraine some air defense missiles, precision-guided artillery and other weapons.

The senior White House official said Trump approved an assessment on aid to “all” countries, including Ukraine. While that review was taking place, the Pentagon took it upon itself to hit pause on the aid to Ukraine. However, the source said, “Trump does not view Hegseth as working ‘unilaterally’ in any way.”

The source did say Trump is frustrated by the war and is “equally” frustrated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin and finds both “impossible” to deal with.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-deportations-could-cost-6m-193200660.html,2025-07-10 20:00:00,"Trump's deportations could cost 6M jobs, report finds","Jul. 10—President Donald Trump's deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.

If successful, Trump's goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

EPI's analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.

The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.

Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation's workforce last year, according to federal data.

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.

Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.

""Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,"" the analysis said.

The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.

Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.

That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.

""While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,"" Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/20-best-girls-episodes-ranked-191500534.html,2025-07-10 20:00:00,"'Girls' Best Episodes, Ranked","When “Girls” premiered, there was no other character like Hannah Horvath on TV. Created by multi-hyphenate Lena Dunham, only 26 at the time, Hannah was shamelessly self-absorbed, but also charming and ambitious. Predictably, Dunham took much of the flak for Hannah’s indiscretions; as the daughter of artist Carroll Dunham and photographer Laurie Simmons, she was saddled with accusations of nepotism that threatened to overshadow her talent. Nevertheless, “Girls” dominated 2010s culture, updating the “Sex and the City” template for a much more downwardly mobile set of New York City strivers: Hannah; her college BFF, uptight gallerist Marnie Michaels (Allison Williams); Jessa Johansson (Jemima Kirke), a beautiful, self- destructive Brit; and Shoshanna Shapiro (Zosia Mamet), a college student who matures much faster than her older friends. By crossing the river into Brooklyn, “Girls” stripped away Carrie Bradshaw’s glamour to paint a refreshingly realistic picture of one’s early 20s as a minefield of awkward sex and unpaid internships. Tocelebrate the debutof Dunham’s latest project, the Netflix series “Too Much,”Varietylooks back on the 20 episodes that show “Girls” at its best.

By Season 5, the girls have moved from their early 20s to the solid middle. With the passage of time comes new milestones, and Marnie’s ill-advised union with philandering musician Desi (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) brings “Girls” into the world of wedding culture. Marnie is, of course, born to be a bridezilla, a prima donna instinct only aggravated by rain, an overbearing Rita Wilson as her mother and a terrible makeup artist, played by the great Bridget Everett. No wonder Hannah has to sneak away and have car sex with her new boyfriend (Jake Lacy) to blow off some steam. Little does she know, Adam (Adam Driver) and Jessa are off starting their own affair, a pairing with seismic consequences down the road. But the world-historical awfulness of the Marnie-Desi marriage is enough to make a comic set-piece on its own. This is hiseighthengagement! Even torch-carrying Ray (Alex Karpovsky) can finally admit they deserve each other.

Hanah’s maternal grandmother, Flo (a delightful June Squibb), appears to be dying. Flo’s decline summons Hannah; her mother, Loreen; and Loreen’s sisters Sissy (Amy Morton) and Margot (Deirdre Lovejoy) to upstate New York, where “Girls” paints a complete family portrait in just half an hour. We quickly pick up on Sissy’s resentment as the childless caretaker and see how Hannah and her cousin Rebecca (Sarah Steele), a workaholic med student, are destined to resent, rather than relate to, one another. “Flo” distills how young adults start to understand their parents as people with baggage and childhood scars of their own — which only adds weight to Loreen’s advice about Hannah’s floundering relationship with Adam: “I don’t want you to spend your life socializing him like he’s a stray dog,” she warns. “It’s not easy being married to an odd man.” That “Flo” has shown Loreen’s own life to be far from perfect ironically helps her point. She’s lived enough life, some of which we’ve just seen the fruits of, to know of what she speaks.

Even on a show with a well-earned reputation for cringe, “On All Fours” stands above. Hannah, in the midst of a downward spiral fueled by an OCD flare-up, punctures her eardrum with a Q-tip, a scene that still evokes a sympathetic shudder. Adam has odd, alienating and borderline violent sex with his new girlfriend, Natalia (Shiri Appleby), which unleashed a firestorm of online discourse at the time. Amid steep competition, Marnie manages to take the cake for most humiliating stunt when she serenades her ex-boyfriend Charlie (Christopher Abbott) with an acoustic cover of Kanye West’s “Stronger” at a party for his app. All three incidents leave lessons to be learned: Hannah’s mental illness poses a danger to her well-being; not all of Adam’s partners will accommodate his proclivities the way that Hannah did; and Marnie, to quote Charlie, has gotta get her shit together. But this wouldn’t be “Girls” if the characters were all that self-aware.

Dunham is a born-and-bred New Yorker, raised in the artistic enclaves of pre-Giuliani SoHo and private school Brooklyn. All the more remarkable, then, how completely she captures the experience of the transplant visiting the middle American hometown she’s worked so hard to distance herself from. Hannah goes back to Michigan for her parents’ anniversary party, treating the high school classmates she encounters there with a mix of naked disdain and poorly disguised envy. “You are from New York. Therefore, you are naturally interesting,” she tells herself in the mirror as part of a pre-date hyping up routine. The line verbalizes a common, unspoken belief in such plain terms it reveals the sentiment’s comic absurdity. As much as contemporary commentators assumed “Girls” was a work of straightforward autobiography, “The Return” is a sterling example of Dunham stepping outside herself to hit on a broader truth.

Hannah’s complications made “Girls” as delicious (and, at times, as controversial) as it was, but even by the show’s high standard, “Dead Inside” is unusually alert to her hypocrisies. After the death of her book editor (John Cameron Mitchell), Hannah’s singleminded focus is on the fate of her project; attempts by Adam and by his sister Caroline (Gaby Hoffmann) to evince from her even a little sympathy go unheard. The episode’s cleverest gambit comes in the final moments. Here, Hannah repurposes a made-up story Caroline had told her about Adam’s goodness, to try to get Hannah to cry and thus prove her humanity, as a story starring herself, indicating that she really does care about the world beyond herself. As a character study, it’s pitch-dark, but the tone stays aloft thanks to playful dialogue and a sense that Hannah, if narcissistic, is at least trying not to beseenas narcissistic. Perhaps that’s a first step!

When Hannah learns Adam has acquired a whole new girlfriend while she’s been in Iowa, it kicks off the closest thing “Girls” has to a true bottle episode: an installment confined to a single preexisting location, in this case Hannah’s Greenpoint apartment. Hannah barricades herself in her former bedroom — the very place Adam has been shacking up with his new flame without officially dumping his old one — and refuses to leave. Instead, everyone from Marnie to Jessa to Shoshanna to Ray comes to visit her, helping her process the end of the relationship. It’s like a shiva, but for realizing just how much you’ve grown apart from your ex. For once, Hannah’s self-indulgent wallowing is very much earned, but she’s eventually able to accept that the end of her time with Adam is for the best.

Hannah’s professional life provides some of the series’ most well-observed humor. Dunham, then a very online individual who was by Season 3 a generation-defining media phenom herself, knew about the culture industry enough to skewer it with precision. That’s exactly what’s at play in this episode, as Hannah’s new opportunity — a job at GQ — is only exhilarating for a day or two before she realizes that she’s writing branded content and that her colleagues have put their ambitions on hold in the name of material comfort. (The lovingly shot office fridge that gives the show its title comes to seem a bit sinister.) None other than Jenna Lyons — at that moment defining a certain preppy American sangfroid as the creative director of J. Crew, with “The Real Housewives of New York City” still in her future — played Hannah’s new boss. Her deadpan, glamorous presence speaks to the genius of the “Girls” approach to casting, as Lyons adds to both the aspirational quality and the chilly remove of the GQ gig.

An immersive theatrical re-creation of the 1964 killing of Kitty Genovese — a crime perpetrated in front of dozens of witnesses — gives this episode its title and impact. As Adam appears in the production, Hannah, watching, experiences the slow-rolling revelation that he has taken up with Jessa. That those around her seem blind to her horror ends up rhyming with the events of the production. Elsewhere, Elijah’s (Andrew Rannells) disappointment with his wealthy boyfriend, Dill Harcourt (Corey Stoll), provides Rannells with something juicy to play, and offers a sharply drawn look at power dynamics in relationships. Dill commanding Elijah to leave his party if he can’t accept the older man’s philandering makes for a jarring moment in what seemed like a dream relationship. It’s the kind of tonal shift at which “Girls” excelled.

That Hannah’s parents (Peter Scolari and Becky Ann Baker) played sizable roles in “Girls” is only surprising until one considers the period of life the series documents. Hannah is only just emerging from the nest and relies on her mom and dad for more than she’d like to admit. The portrait of Tad and Loreen Horvath that comes into view is a sorrowful one: These two people spent their adult lives talking past one another to get through raising their child. Now, with Hannah in New York, they’re forced to see themselves and each other more clearly. This episode features the long-foreshadowed moment when Tad comes out as gay. And his relentless self-scrutiny, as well as his wife’s sharp sense that what’s being done is a punishment, are beautifully written and performed. They also provide new angles from which to see Hannah.

Hannah’s move to the Midwest to attend the Iowa Writers’ Workshop reboots many of the show’s relationships. Indeed, while Hannah video-chats with an exasperated Marnie, attempts to call Shoshanna and is visited by Elijah, old dynamics have shifted. But starting over isn’t easy: “Triggering” deftly introduces a classroom full of potential new friends for Hannah, only to promptly depict them as alienated both by her work — barely concealed memoir presented as fiction — and her demanding presence. Hannah facing criticism tends to bring out an intriguing side of her character. Interrogating how resistant she can be to opportunities for growth — and looking with care rather than scorn at the kind of writer she actually is — “Triggering” stands out among the short run of Iowa episodes and gives a welcome glimpse into Hannah as writer, and how she’s perceived by her peers.

“Welcome to Bushwick” marks the first time all the major players are gathered in one place: a warehouse party on the bleeding edge of Brooklyn gentrification. Many streams that were separate cross in this episode to disastrous, yet hilarious, effect: Marnie is horrified to discover that Charlie has moved on to a new love, played by Dunham’s real-life friend Audrey Gelman. Jessa accidentally invites her older boss (James Le Gros), a cool dad who can’t hang like he used to. And Hannah realizes she doesn’t know much about Adam outside their situationship, from his friends to his past struggles with addiction. Shoshanna’s crack-smoking misadventure, which inaugurates her relationship with the misanthropic Ray when he’s assigned to babysit her, is just the cherry on top of an already chaotic evening, even if it’s the best-remembered part.

“Girls” bids goodbye to its most significant relationship by having Hannah and Adam spend a day speed-running a potential life together, play-acting the stable partnership they were never able to forge. Adam makes a sudden, radical proposal to a visibly pregnant Hannah: What if he abandoned his girlfriend, Jessa, so they could parent the baby together? Hannah almost gives herself over to the fantasy, but when Adam brings up serious practicalities like marriage, it’s all too much. Dunham and Driver are never better than when playing out their characters’ dawning, unspoken understanding that this isn’t going to happen. “What’s the rest of your night look like?” Adam asks a weeping Hannah, because they won’t be spending it — or any other — together. Unlike so many series in their final days, “Girls” resists the easy satisfaction of sending Hannah and Adam off into the sunset.

“Girls” would technically continue for another three-plus seasons after “Beach House,” but this iconic episode makes what would become the series’ closing argument: that as they get further away from college and into their actual lives, the girls — three of whom met at Oberlin — don’t have much in common anymore. They discover this over the course of a weekend on the North Fork of Long Island organized and micromanaged by Marnie, who wants to “prove to everyone via Instagram that we can still have fun as a group.” When she puts it that way, the mission is doomed even before Hannah reconnects with Elijah, who invites his friends over to the house, further aggravating Marnie’s control-freak tendencies. On top of that, Shoshanna unloads on everyone in a fantastically vicious monologue. “Beach House” is an early indication that Shosh, the youngest of the group, will also be the first to outgrow it. She knows, and deserves, better.

Jessa can be a challenging character: Affecting an attitude of being above her friends’ petty dramas, she resists being drawn into the show’s stories. Here she receives special consideration, as a trip she and Hannah take together to visit Jessa’s neglectful father (Ben Mendelsohn) forces her to confront emotions she would rather avoid. Kirke does her best acting of the series opposite Mendelsohn; her declaration that she deserves more care than he ever gave her — “I’mthe child!” — resonates throughout the show. The episode takes its name from Jessa’s stepmother (Rosanna Arquette) declaring that what we perceive as the world is a simulation. Hannah is sympathetic to this perspective; she has a sexual interlude with Jessa’s teen stepbrother (Nick Lashaway), as if to prove to herself that nothing really matters. For the moment, it doesn’t, but as in other of the best “Girls” episodes, reality is beginning to intrude.

Though it disrupted the plan for the show, Christopher Abbott’s abrupt departure from “Girls” after the end of Season 2 did conclude a storyline that was threatening to run out of road. (Abbott’s Charlie, the on/off boyfriend of Marnie, had finally committed to love after 20 episodes of turmoil.) It turned out a radical new direction was available! When Marnie encounters a transformed Charlie — once docile, now a Stanley Kowalski type — she reconnects with him to hide out from the dramas of her real life. Their blissed-out night together has an insidious undertow, as Marnie, gleefully pushing past her instincts, overlooks that Charlie is now a cocaine dealer. Once Marnie wakes up, she realizes she must return to her old life. This was, perhaps, one of the last moments Marnie could contemplate a full- scale reinvention, and Williams’ performance is imbued with a wistful acknowledgment of the passage of time that hits with a wallop.

For all intents and purposes, “Goodbye Tour” is the series finale of “Girls”; the actual last episode is more of a coda. It’s in “Goodbye Tour” that Hannah, Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna are in the same place for what will probably be the last time. The friend group has already drifted so far apart that Shoshanna has gotten engaged without inviting Hannah to the celebration, or even telling her she’s dating someone. “I think we should all agree to call it,” Shoshanna says. “Girls” began with Shoshanna drawing attention to the forced feeling of the TV-show friend group (“Why are we all standing in a line?”). It ends with her once again acknowledging what TV so rarely does: that friendships can outlive their usefulness as the friends’ circles expand along with their lives. Without a community in New York, there’s nothing to keep Hannah from accepting a teaching job upstate. When she sees a couple of best friends shopping for their first apartment, she’s looking back in time at her Season 1 self, underscoring how far “Girls” has followed these characters past their starting point. But friendships fade, new chapters open and TV series come to a close.

The Hannah-Marnie relationship can go under-discussed in evaluations of the “Girls” legacy in part because of just howrealit was; it evolved, changed forms and even faded from view in the way of real friendships. Perhaps the moment that crystallized it was the ending of “All Adventurous Women Do,” in which Hannah — having come to terms with various personal dramas — brings Marnie into her bedroom for a dance party culminating in an embrace. What came before, in this episode, was the glimmering sense of how many surprising challenges adult life might come to present: Hannah’s ex Elijah came out to her, and she was diagnosed with HPV. Hannah is a congenital overthinker, and spends much of the episode agonizing over how her life is changing, but her choice to let things go and to lean on her complicated, beloved best friend makes for an all-timer of a closing sequence.

Landing only months before the 2017 revelations of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual abuse kicked off the #MeToo movement, this episode exemplifies Dunham’s uncanny ability to pick up on moods thrumming beneath the surface of the culture just before they break into view. Here, Hannah visits the home of celebrated novelist Chuck Palmer (Matthew Rhys), at his invitation, to discuss rumors that he is a sex pest. (She’s written about the rumors; he denies them.) The story trickily shifts, and then shifts again — Hannah is taken in by Chuck’s worldliness and charm before he, as if by compulsion, exposes his genitals. Much writing would be produced, in the months and years after “American Bitch,” about the problem of what to do with men who exploit power imbalances. This episode doesn’t have an answer, but it rigorously and honestly documents what it feels like to be, for a tense and painful moment, inside the question.

One shocking three-word statement from her mother shifts Hannah from bougie comfort to the precarity that defines the entirety of “Girls”: “No more money.” After being cut off by her parents, Hannah attempts to turn her internship at an independent publisher into a real job and fails. Then she tries to reconnect with her old friend Jessa and can’t. Finally, she tries to escape it all by drinking opium tea and ends up weepily confessing her ambition — and her need for recognition — to her parents. From this first episode, “Girls” was made with a startling confidence. Hannah emerges as an utterly believable character, down to her episode-ending decision to steal a tip her parents left for their hotel maid. But a greater feat may be the seamless and complete world she inhabits, with her family and friends introduced with wit and carefully chosen detail.

“Girls” is the defining text of a deeply millennial experience: the feeling that — to quote another HBO masterpiece, “The Sopranos” — the protagonists’ generation “came in at the end of something.” No episode illustrates that thesis as well as “One Man’s Trash.” After Hannah goes to apologize to Joshua (Patrick Wilson), the handsome doctor in whose trash cans she’s been dumping garbage from the coffee shop where she works, she finds herself enjoying a lost weekend ensconced in the wealth and stability that feel so unattainable to her as a freelance writer and barista. The rest of the world — including the rest of the main cast — falls away, in the first and best example of “Girls” breaking form to tighten its focus, an approach that would pay dividends in seasons to come. To the episode’s eternal credit, Joshua is no mere fantasy for Hannah to project onto; he’s recently separated and just as adrift in his way as his temporary fling. Hannah’s dawning realization that she may crave comfort and support as much as exotic experiences to fuel her artistry gives “One Man’s Trash” its enduring impact. In the long aftermath of the stock market crash of 2008, literary renown is a lofty dream, but basic prosperity feels even more out of reach.

President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.

If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

EPI’sanalysisfound California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.

The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.

Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of thenation’s workforcelast year, according to federal data.

If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.

Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.

“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.

The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated$170 billionfor immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.

Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to theFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy,told Forbesthis week.

That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.

“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/nh-judge-blocks-trump-attempt-202719974.html,2025-07-10 21:00:00,"NH judge blocks Trump attempt to end birthright citizenship, grants class action status","Deputy Director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project Cody Wofsy (center) speaks to reporters after a U.S. District Court of New Hampshire hearing in which Judge Joseph Laplante said he would block President Donald Trump’s anti-birthright citizenship executive order, July 10, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)

A federal district court judge in New Hampshire said Thursday he will issue an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and will hold that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.

Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t now have injunctions, but it will be stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.

Issued in January,the executive order, titled, “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid.

On Thursday, Laplante agreed.

“The deprivation of U.S. citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”

Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the forthcoming ruling in a press conference after the hearing.

“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”

Laplante’s ruling came weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class actions — national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held.

Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action designation to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action within days of theCasadecision in June.

The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities.

Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants.

Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.

Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.

“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said.

The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there.

Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump.In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order.

In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/energy-experts-alarmed-budget-bill-071000120.html,2025-07-11 09:15:00,Energy experts alarmed after budget bill keeps cuts to solar tax credits: 'Take action now',"Despite increased pressure from environmental groups and solar energy advocates, the controversial ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" has been signed into law. Because of this, the residential solar tax credit is now set to expire by the end of 2025.

In an officialreleasefrom the White House, the signing ofH.R.1was confirmed on July 4.

""Today, President Donald J. Trump officially signed The One Big Beautiful Bill into law — a once-in-a-generation piece of legislation that makes good on his campaign promises and puts America First,"" the release read.

According to the White House, the bill will help drive down ""energy costs with a massive expansion of domestic oil and gas production capacity."" This development aligns with the Trump administration's goal of ""Unleashing American Energy"" in an effort to make use of ""affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.""

But as EnergySagenoted, this unleashing of energy will likely not include wind and solar energy resources. And perhaps more importantly to homeowners, H.R.1 failed to include an extension of the 30% residential solar tax credit.

The bill eliminates the Residential Clean Energy Credit, also known as the solar ITC, for purchases made after December 31, 2025. This means that homeowners who purchase and install solar panels, battery storage, and geothermal heat pumps must have their systems installed by the end of 2025 to be eligible for the 30% tax credit.

""The abrupt elimination would further disrupt the solar market, which is already facing economic headwinds due to Trump's tariffs and an earlier pause onIRAfunds,"" wrote EnergySage.

By reducing the upfront cost of solar installations, the solar ITC aimed to make solar power more accessible and accelerate the transition toward cleaner energy sources.

Solar energy is a clean, renewable resource that produces zero pollution and reduces our reliance on dirty fuels. This can help in our fight against the steadily increasing global temperature.

Additionally, solar panels can significantly lower electricity bills, potentially increasing your home's value.EnergySagegives you access to its free tools to help get quick solar installation estimates and compare quotes.

While it is now too late for that to change, speaking up is still valuable to show representatives what voters care about. In the meantime, with the solar ITC set to expire by the end of the year, you might not have a better opportunity to save money while helping cool down our planet.

President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.

If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.

The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.

Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of thenation’s workforcelast year, according to federal data.

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.

Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.

“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.

The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated$170 billionfor immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.

Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to theFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy,told Forbesthis week.

That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.

“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

(FOX 56) — Kaylieb Thompson said it was seven years of love—in every sense of the word—between him and his girlfriend, Reacheal Dawson.

He even planned to propose to her on July 2, but their time together would come to an abrupt end just days before he was about to get down on one knee.

“This person right here. That was — that’s who loved me. That’s who accepted me. And that’s who wanted to build a life with me. And I don’t have that anymore. I have a piece of paper and ashes soon,” Thompson said while holding a picture of his girlfriend.

On Thursday, June 26, Thompson said he had not heard from Dawson for a few hours and couldn’t get in touch with her, which was unusual.

Court documents allege Winchester man tied to deaths of 2 women at motel, Airbnb

When his son called him, saying “Ree-Ree,” as Thompson referred to her, was not home, he knew something was wrong.

“I went outside, and I screamed for her. I screamed until some of our furthest neighbors around our one-lane road heard because I couldn’t stop. I just kept screaming for her. I just kept calling her phone. She wasn’t answering,” he told FOX 56.

Her family reported her missing shortly after midnight on June 27.

Dawson’s sister pinged her phone’s location, which showed that she was at the Red Roof Inn on Interstate Drive in Winchester.

When first responders got there, they found Dawson dead in one of the rooms inside. According to authorities, that room was rented out by Brian Epperson.

He was arrested on June 27and later charged with murder in connection with another death — the May 31 overdose of 32-year-old Kristen Morris, who was found dead inside a Powell County Airbnb.

Investigators said she had an extremely high level of methamphetamine in her system.

Epperson allegedly admitted to filling capsules with methamphetamine. Police said they found such capsules at both the Powell County Airbnb and the Winchester motel.

Thompson said Dawson never did drugs. Now, he is left wondering how and why this could’ve happened to her.

“This was going to be my wife. This was going to be the mother of my children. And now everything’s gone. Why am I left with that?” he asked.

Epperson has not been charged with Dawson’s murder, but police said he is a prime suspect. They are still waiting on a toxicology report.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-parental-rights-restored-mahmoud-110000894.html,2025-07-11 14:15:00,Opinion - Parental rights restored: Mahmoud case is a victory for families and faith,"Three years ago, the doors of my daughter’s school abruptly closed on my role as her mother. They dismissed my voice and removed my ability to make decisions regarding her education.

Last month, the Supreme Court restored what should have never been taken away.

The Court’s 6-3 ruling against Montgomery County School Board is a lifeline for parents like me, reaffirming a bedrock principle of our nation’s fabric: Parents have the right — and the responsibility—to raise their children according to their faith and values. It is not the government’s place to dismantle that sacred bond.

The storybooks at the heart of this dispute were championed as tools for “inclusivity,” but they contradicted this label. Rolled out in 2022 for pre-K through fifth-grade classrooms, these materials went beyond their facade of promoting kindness. Instead, they aimed to immerse children — some as young as three — in complex and radical ideas about gender and sexuality.

One book, written for preschoolers, introduced obscure symbols such as the “intersex flag” and “leather” alongside celebratory nods to drag culture. These topics are ill-suited for children who rely on bedtime stories to ease them into sleep.

Initially, concerned parents were given the option to opt-out of lessons containing these books. This was entirely consistent with Maryland law, which permits exemptions from coursework on human sexuality, as well as Montgomery County’s longstanding Religious Diversity Guidelines. Under those guidelines, all families — whether Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, or from any other background — were assured the right to excuse their children from material contrary to their beliefs.

But that promise proved fleeting. In 2023, the school board made an abrupt and heavy-handed reversal. Parental notifications ceased, and opt-out requests would no longer be respected. Suddenly, choices that rightfully belonged to parents were stripped away.

For my family, this policy wreaked havoc. My 12-year-old daughter, a child with Down syndrome, faces profound challenges in a school setting. She is deeply trusting of authority and struggles to reconcile conflicts between what the parents teach at home and what her teacher presents in the classroom. Her faith, like her trust, is tender and unguarded. The trust we built with her over years can be eroded with a single lesson that contradicts our Catholic convictions.

We were forced into an impossible situation, choosing between her education and her spiritual well-being. With much prayer and deliberation, my husband and I made the wrenching decision to withdraw her from the public school system altogether.

The cost of homeschooling — financial, emotional, and logistical — has been immense. Specialized resources for a child with learning disabilities are not inexpensive, nor are they easy to replicate outside a structured classroom. But we believed we could not stand by while the school undermined our faith within the very institution meant to nurture her growth.

We are not alone in this experience. Parents across the country have been grappling with these same dilemmas. Some have resorted to homeschooling, like us, bearing the enormous burden of going it alone. Others, lacking the resources or circumstances to make that pivot, found themselves compelled to send their children into classrooms where they feared what their children were being taught and what they might uncritically absorb.

This is not just about child-inappropriate books or curricula. It is about trust. It is about parents having confidence that their role in shaping their children’s hearts and minds is being respected and not overridden.

When officials choose to betray that trust, what recourse remains other than to fight back?

That’s what brought our family, along with many others of diverse faiths, to federal court. Together, we sought not to censor, ban, or isolate, but to reclaim our rightful place in these consequential decisions. We asked, plainly and simply, to be notified when such topics would arise in the classroom and to be allowed the choice to opt-out. For more than two years, the lower courts sided with the school board, leaving our pleas unheard.

Finally, last month, we received the affirmation that had been so long denied. The Supreme Court ruled, in no uncertain terms, that parents do not relinquish their rights at the schoolhouse doors.

Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, captured the heart of the victory, stating, “It is both insulting and legally unsound to tell parents that they must abstain from public education in order to raise their children in their religious faiths.”

This ruling is not about denying children their opportunity to learn about the broader world. Rather, it is about restoring a vital balance — ensuring that education does not come at the expense of family values or parental authority.

For me, this fight was never about convenience or personal gain. It was about protecting the sanctuary of our home and the spiritual foundation we strive to install in our children. Sacrifice is at the core of parenthood, and sometimes, that sacrifice leads you to places where you never expected — like a courtroom.

Today I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the Justices who chose to honor the sacred bond between parent and child. No government should hold the power to sever that bond. Parents know what their children need, and now, we have the affirmation to act on that knowledge once again.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/flash-flood-warning-franklin-hampshire-215330488.html,2025-07-11 23:30:00,Update: Flash flood warning for Hampshire County Friday evening caused by thunderstorms,"At 7 p.m. on Friday, the National Weather Service issued an updated flash flood warning in effect until 8:45 p.m. for Hampshire County.

""At 7 p.m., Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between 2 and 4.5 inches of rain have fallen according to Doppler radar estimates. Additional rainfall amounts up to 1 inch are possible in the warned area. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,"" states the weather service. ""Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.""

Locations impacted by the warning include Holyoke, Northampton, South Hadley, Easthampton, Hadley, Hatfield, Williamsburg, Huntington, Westhampton, Whately, Chesterfield and Goshen.

The weather service comments, ""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads. In hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are potentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded roads. Find an alternate route.""

Flash flood warning: Take action!

A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood-prone area, move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain.

Flood warning: Take action!

A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring.

Flood advisory: Be aware:

A flood advisory is released when flooding is not expected to reach a severity level necessitating a warning. Nonetheless, it can still cause considerable inconvenience and, without exercising caution, potentially lead to situations that threaten life and/or property.

Flood watch: Be prepared:

A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.

Floods can pose a significant threat, especially if you live in a flood-prone area or find yourself camping in a low-lying region. To ensure your safety, the weather service offers essential flood safety guidelines:

Seek higher ground:

If you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.

Adhere to evacuation orders:

If local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.

Disconnect utilities and appliances:

If time allows, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This reduces the risk of electrical hazards during flooding.

Avoid basements and submerged areas:

Steer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.

Evacuate promptly for safety:

If you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.

Stay away from floodwaters:

Never attempt to walk through floodwaters, even if they appear shallow. Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can forcefully sweep you off your feet.

Seek high ground if trapped:

Should you become trapped by moving water, reach the highest point possible and dial 911 to contact emergency services.

When heavy rain occurs, there is a risk of flooding, particularly in low-lying and flood-prone regions. It is important to never attempt to drive through water on the road, regardless of how deep it appears. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rushing water can sweep away most vehicles. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared.

When heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here's your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours:

Beware of swollen waterways:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Reduce speed and drive cautiously:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.

Visibility matters:

Turn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.

If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/current-severe-thunderstorm-warning-expiring-220430032.html,2025-07-12 01:15:00,Update: The current severe thunderstorm warning will be expiring at 7 p.m.,"The warning had been issued for Middlesex and Worcester counties.

""The storm which prompted the warning has weakened below severe limits, and no longer poses an immediate threat to life or property. Therefore, the warning will be allowed to expire. However gusty winds and heavy rain are still possible with this thunderstorm,"" says the National Weather Service.

Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.

To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, keep these recommendations in mind:

Lightning safety plan:

When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.

Stay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's a clear indication of nearby lightning.

Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors.

Indoors safety measures:

Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors.

These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways.

Wait for the all-clear:

After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.

Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution.

When indoor shelter isn't available:

If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:

Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.

Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.

If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.

Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.

Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.

In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety.

When heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards:

Beware of rapid water flow:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Reduce speed and drive cautiously:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.

Prioritize visibility

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

https://www.yahoo.com/news/pentagon-probes-examine-key-hegseth-194038865.html,2025-07-14 20:15:00,Pentagon probes examine key Hegseth allies,"Two of the Pentagon’s top investigative bodies are digging into a pair of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s close aides and their role in the controversy surrounding government use of the Signal app to discuss sensitive information, according to three people familiar with the probes.

The Defense Department Inspector General’s office first opened an investigationin early Aprilinto whether Hegseth violated the agency’s standards for sharing classified information by using the commercial messaging app to discuss active attack plans in Yemen.

As part of that probe, investigators are looking into whether senior Hegseth aide Ricky Buria helped the Pentagon chief set upan unsecured internet linethat bypassed the agency’s security protocols and allowed Hegseth to access Signal, according to the three people, all of whom were interviewed recently by officials about the situation. The Signal app isnot approved for government use when discussing classified informationbecause of security concerns.

In aseparate inquiryled by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, a federal law enforcement agency within the Pentagon, investigators are asking whether Buria could have been a source for leaks when he sat in on sensitive meetings as a military aide earlier this year and had access to Hegseth’s devices, according to the three people.

Investigators for the Air Force agency, known as OSI, also want to know whether the Pentagon chief’s personal attorney, Tim Parlatore — whoserves as atop DOD adviser — attended meetings beyond his clearance level where classified information was discussed, and his role investigating the leaks, the three people said. The focus of the DOD probes on the two top Hegseth aides has not been previously reported.

The inquiries into the actions of Hegseth and his inner circle could further destabilize the Pentagon’s top ranks after aspate of firings in a leakinvestigation left the Defense secretary without a chief of staff or a top policy adviser for months. The Air Force investigation began this spring.

“Ricky and Tim are some of the folks that they’re zeroing in on as they try to get to the root of everything,” said one of the people familiar with the two probes. This person, like the others, was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive ongoing investigations.

Buria didn’t respond to a request for comment, while Parlatore declined to comment. The DOD IG declined to comment, citing longstanding policy not to talk publicly about the scope or timeline of oversight projects. The Air Force declined to discuss details about the probe.

Buria, the top military aide who recently transitioned to a senior DOD civilian job, and Parlatore, Hegseth’s longtime lawyer, have emerged as two of the Pentagon chief’s most trusted allies.

But officials have hinted that the administration’s patiencemay be wearing thinfrom repeated missteps by Hegseth and his close allies— includingcatching much of Washington off guardon key policy decisions ranging from the freeze of Ukraine military aid to reviewing the AUKUS submarine deal.

That Defense Department investigators have homed in on Buria and Parlatore also represents a possible step forward in a probe that has consumed the Pentagon for months.

The Pentagon IG probe came afterreports in The Atlanticthat Hegseth in March had used Signal to discuss details of military operations in Yemen with top Trump administration officials.

Questions the IG investigators have asked witnesses include, “Who wrote the information attributed to the Secretary of Defense in The Atlantic regarding the ‘Houthi PC Small Group’ Signal chat?” and “Please describe who was present with the Secretary of Defense on March 15, 2025,” the day he sent the messages, according to an email to potential witnesses ahead of interviews and obtained by POLITICO. The questions werefirst reported by the Associated Press.

Investigators have asked about the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the Signal app, how extensively Hegseth used it and the veracity of messages reported by The Atlantic, according to the three people and the emails.

The IG and OSI have also questioned witnesses about whether they were ever asked to delete Signal messages off their phones, according to two of the people,which could violate federal records laws, such as the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act. These may carry civil and administrative penalties. Officials can also be sentenced to jail time and forced to pay fines if they are found guilty of removing classified information or destroying government records under similar laws.

One of the people said that OSI investigators asked by name whether Buria or Parlatore made those requests.

The Pentagon did not answer questions about probes into Hegseth or his allies at the Defense Department, but it championed the Pentagon chief’s resume. “Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has successfully reoriented the Department of Defense to put the interests of America’s Warfighters and America’s taxpayers first, and it has never been better positioned to execute on its mission than it is today,” Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Sean Parnell said in an emailed statement. “The success speaks for itself.”

An Air Force spokesperson confirmed OSI is “conducting an investigation into allegations of unauthorized disclosures” on behalf of Hegseth’s office, but declined to comment on the specifics of the probe. One of the people with knowledge of the matter said the investigators have been talking to witnesses since late April.

The investigations have intensified questions about Hegseth’s leadership in the department, one of the people familiar with the probe said. POLITICOpreviously reportedthat Hegseth was deferring to U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Erik Kurilla as planning for American military strikes against Iran ramped up last month. U.S. allies havealso been caught off guardby the Pentagon’s abrupt pause of some weapons shipments to Ukraine.

Hegseth’s closest allies maintain that he has played a key role in the strikes, pushing NATO allies to a 5 percent defense spending target, and boosting recruiting. “None of this would have been possible without the complete unity and discipline of the OSD team and the vision and leadership of our commander-in-chief,"" Parnell said in the statement.

Parlatore’s presence in Hegseth’s inner circle has raised questions about conflicts of interest, as hehas been involved in multiple legal cases opposingthe U.S. government, including defending retired four-star Adm. Robert Burke against charges of alleged corruption. Parlatore, who has said he doesn’t market himself to clients as a Navy reservist or a Hegseth adviser, has dismissed the notion that his lawsuits represent an issue."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/despite-trump-saying-no-more-201433977.html,2025-07-14 21:00:00,"Despite Trump saying there are no more Epstein files, Lara Trump says he will release more Epstein files","President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump has claimed that his administration will “probably” release more documents about Jeffrey Epstein, despite his repeated statements to the contrary.

Inan interviewwith right-wing broadcaster Benny Johnson on Monday, Lara Trump — who is married to Trump’s son Eric — said the President wanted to “set things right” and would release more documents sooner rather than later.

“There's no great plot to keep this information away that I'm aware of. I just believe that maybe it's been slow-rolled, for reasons that hopefully we understand down the line,” the Fox News host and former Republican Party official told Johnson.

Her answer contradictedthe Trump administration’s announcement last week there is actually no “Epstein client list”and that no further disclosures are “appropriate or warranted”, as well asTrump’s own pleading with his supporters to drop the subject.

That came after many months of Trump officials and outriders trumpeting the imminent release of bombshell secret Epstein documents,including the convicted sex offender financier’s supposed “client list”.

The abrupt about-facesparked fury among Trump’s fan base, who had been primed to expect the unraveling of a vast child abuse conspiracy centered on Trump’s political opponents.

“Look, I don’t know what truly exists there, but I know this is something that’s important to the president as well,” Lara Trump said in her interview with Johnson.

“He does want transparency on all these fronts, everything we’re talking about. Because it’s frustrated him as well. He sat for four years like the rest of us did and saw lie after lie and our country just being sent down the wrong path...

“I know this is probably not his number one thing he’s focused on... but he hears all the noise, and he hears all the consternation out there, and I think he’s gonna want to set things right as well.

“So I believe that there will probably be more coming on this, and I believe anything that they are able to release — that doesn’t damage any witnesses or anyone underage, or anything like that — I believe they’ll probably try to get out sooner rather than later.”

Trump’s own statements have set a very different tone, suggesting that the so-called “Epstein files” were merely a hoax concocted by his enemies in order to persecute him.

“We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people” are trying to hurt it — all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” he said on his social network Truth Social on Saturday.

“For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again... let’s not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

At a press conference last week, he also admonished a reporter who asked him about Epstein, saying: ""This guy's been talked about for years... we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. And are people are still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.""

Epstein’s own abuse of minors has been extensively documented, and his “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell was criminally convicted for her role in trafficking girls for him. Allegations he also provided victims to rich and powerful “clients” have never been definitively proven.

Thousands of pages of documents have already been made public, including Epstein’s address book. The term ‘Epstein list’ often simply means a list of all the people mentioned in these documents,which includes victims and bystanders as well as alleged associates.

But in recent years, Trump and his allies have embraced the idea that there is another “list” the government is covering up: a client list containing the names of everyone who abused girls trafficked by Epstein.

That was red meat for the ardently conspiracist MAGA movement and theprofessional fantasists who sustain it, many of whom see Epstein as merely the tip of an iceberg involving more fanciful theories such asQAnon.

On Sunday the official account of Sesame Street muppetElmo even weighed in, having been temporarily taken over by an unknown hacker.

""RELEASE THE FILES @realDonaldTrump CHILD F*****,"" wrote the hacker, in between calls for genocide against Jews."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/flash-flood-warning-place-franklin-190430969.html,2025-07-14 21:15:00,Update: Flash flood warning in place for Hampden and Hampshire counties until Monday night due to thunderstorms,"An updated flash flood warning was issued by the National Weather Service on Monday at 5:55 p.m. in effect until 9 p.m. for Hampden and Hampshire counties.

""At 5:55 p.m., Doppler radar indicated thunderstorms producing heavy rain across the warned area. Between 1.5 and 2 inches of rain have fallen. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly,"" states the weather service. ""Flash flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas.""

Locations impacted by the warning include Southampton, Huntington, Russell, Westhampton, Chester, Blandford, Chesterfield, Worthington, Montgomery and Middlefield.

According to the weather service, ""Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.""

Flash flood warning: Take action!

A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it's crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall.

Flood warning: Take action!

A flood warning is declared when flooding is on the verge of happening or is already underway.

Flood advisory: Be aware:

A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.

Flood watch: Be prepared:

A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.

In flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver:

Move to higher ground:

If you reside in a flood-prone region or are camping in low-lying terrain, the first step to safety is relocating to higher ground.

Follow evacuation orders:

If local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.

Disconnect utilities and appliances:

If time allows, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This reduces the risk of electrical hazards during flooding.

Avoid basements and submerged areas:

Steer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.

Swift evacuation for your safety:

If you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.

Stay away from floodwaters:

Never attempt to walk through floodwaters. Even just 6 inches of swiftly moving water can forcefully knock you off your feet.

Seek higher ground when trapped:

In the event you become trapped by moving water, make your way to the highest point available and contact emergency services by calling 911.

During heavy rainfall, there is a risk of flooding, especially in low-lying and flood-prone areas. Remember to never drive through water on the road, even if it seems shallow. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most cars. Stay safe by being prepared and informed.

When heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here's your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours:

Beware of rapid water flow:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Slow down and drive with care:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.

Prioritize visibility:

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Heavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/scale-afghans-returning-iran-overwhelming-120941807.html,2025-07-15 12:45:00,"The scale of Afghans returning from Iran is overwhelming, says UN official","ISLAMABAD (AP) — The pace and scale of Afghans returning from Iran are overwhelming already fragile support systems, a senior U.N. official warned Tuesday, with tens of thousands of people crossing the border daily exhausted and traumatized, relying on humanitarian aid.

So far this year, more than 1.4 million people have returned or been forced to return to Afghanistan, including over 1 million from Iran.

IranandPakistanin 2023 launched separate campaigns to expel foreigners they said were living in the country illegally. They set deadlines and threatened them with deportation if they didn’t leave. The two governments deny targeting Afghans, who have fled their homeland over the decades to escape war, povertyor Taliban rule.

The U.N. special representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, called for immediate international support for Afghanistan following a visit to the Islam Qala border crossing in western Herat province near Iran.

The “sheer volume of returns —many abrupt, many involuntary,” should be setting off alarm bells across the global community, Otunbayeva said.

“Without swift interventions, remittance losses, labor market pressures and cyclical migration will lead to devastating consequences such as the further destabilization of both returnee and host populations, renewed displacement, mass onward movement, and risks to regional stability,” she said.

Returns from Iran peaked in June following a 20 March government deadline requiring all “undocumented” Afghans to leave. The U.N. migration agency recorded more than 28,000 people crossing back into Afghanistan on June 25.

Afghanistan is a ‘forgotten crisis’

Most Afghans depend on humanitarian assistance to survive. But deepfunding cutsareworseningthe situation, with aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations forced to cut education and health care programs.

Nicole van Batenburg, from the International Federation of the Red Cross, said Afghan children returning from Iran are developing scabies, fever and other illnesses because of deteriorating conditions at the border and the hot weather. Her colleagues were reuniting hundreds of children daily who got separated from their parents.

People lost their belongings and documents in the chaos of hasty exits. Most were only able to take a few suitcases with them, and some were now using their luggage as makeshift furniture.

“Afghanistan is an unseen crisis, and there are so many crises going on at this moment in the world that it seems to be forgotten,” van Batenburg told The Associated Press by phone from the border.

“The problems and the challenges are immense. We’re only talking about the situation here at the border, but these people have to return to some areas where they can live longer and where they can rebuild their lives.”

Last week, the Norwegian Refugee Council said many of its staff were hosting returning families in their homes. Authorities were doing their best to mobilize the few resources they had, but local systems were not equipped to cope with “such tremendous” needs.

(Screencap)

Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in filing suit against President Donald Trump’s administration over $6.8 billion in unexpectedly frozen funds for education initiatives like summer programming and adult learning.

Thelawsuitwas filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. The complaint is the first legal response to a June 30 email memo sent from the U.S. Department of Education to education departments nationwide detailing the abrupt suspension of billions in federal education grants.

A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments werepausedon June 30, the last day of fiscal year 2025. The maneuver’s timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha suggested during a virtual press conference Monday with the Attorneys General of California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, who co-lead the lawsuit.

“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year…when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.

The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. In states like Massachusetts, the grants also subsidized education for children of migrant workers.

Rhode Island would lose an estimated $29 million in federal funds. Across New England, Massachusetts would see a loss of over $100 million, and Connecticut would receive $50 million less. Vermont and Maine would lose $25 million each. New Hampshire, which would also see a $25 million loss of grant funding, is the only New England state not listed as a plaintiff in the suit.

The grants now depend on a review meant to ascertain whether “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” according to the three-sentence email from the education department sentJune 30.

The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”

The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multi-state lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted the press conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.”

“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.

The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. Apairof court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”

Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having justwrapped upits legislative session three weeks prior.

“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure.

But the AG said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January.

Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Greenpreviously denouncedthe funding freeze at a July 9 press conference. In a Monday statement, Infante-Green again decried the funding stoppage as one that “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The $29 million loss of Congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said.

“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk. RIDE is working closely with education leaders across the state, and across the country, doing everything we can to protect our students and limit disruptions to their learning.“

Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Neronha’s office. His office’s  website hastalliedits salvoes against the Trump administration since March 13. Thus far, Neronha has co-led or joined26 lawsuitsagainst the Trump administration.

Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.

“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record…we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tylenol-parent-kenvue-ceo-lots-155028888.html,2025-07-16 00:15:00,Yahoo Finance,"Two years ago, when Johnson & Johnson announced it was spinning off its consumer brands including Tylenol, Band-Aid, Motrin, Sudafed, and Neutrogena into a new company called Kenvue, investor anticipation was high. The thinking was simple: The company was packed with household names that had room to grow, untethered from all the problems of the J&J mothership.

Kenvue shares rose 22% in their trading debut in May 2023. But the honeymoon was short-lived. Barely 15 months after the spinoff, activist investors tired of anemic growth, started to demand change. Since last autumn, Starboard, Third Point Capital and Toms Capital Investment Management have all pressured the company to find ways to accelerate growth and increase profit margins.

All that culminated on Monday withthe abrupt resignationof Kenvue CEO Thibaut Mongon, his replacement by board director Kirk Perry on an interim basis, and the confirmation that Kenvue is undertaking a strategic review in the hopes of “optimizing” a sprawling portfolio and boosting profitability.

“Kenvue has world-class brands in attractive categories and a strong global platform. The actions announced today are to ensure we have the right talent, brand portfolio and operational foundation to fully capitalize on those strengths, accelerate profitable growth and best position the Company for future success,” said Larry Merlo, Kenvue’s chair and the former CEO ofCVS Health.

The leadership shakeup comes on the heels of a rough earnings call. Kenvue announced on Monday that in its most recent quarter, it expects net sales to fall 4%, continuing a downward trend. As a result of that weak performance, shares fell from their all time high of about $27 in 2023 to around $21.25 today. In contrast, the S&P 500 has risen more than 40% in the last two years.

Kenvue’s challenges stem from the same factors that created so much optimism at its debut. J&J spun off its consumer business to focus on its highly profitable pharmaceutical businesses, much asMerck,Sanofi,PfizerandGSKhad in previous years. The goal was to streamline J&J, not make Kenvue’s portfolio composition ideal from the start.

The practice is not unusual in corporate America; spinoffs are often repositories for brands the parent company did not want. But Kenvue struggled to balance and diversify its own brand portfolio, and figure out a formula that would work outside of the J&J umbrella. In retrospect, a boosterish comment from Mongon on the day of the spinoff, who had been leading J&J’s consumer business since 2019, seems like a warning sign. “We are the only company of our size covering all of consumer health,” Mongon said in 2023.

Fortunewas unable to reach Mongon for comment.

Ultimately, the activists pressuring Kenvue to sell off some brands, or even consider selling itself entirely (its market capitalization is $40 billion) have prevailed. Last month,Reutersreportedthat Kenvue was focusing on its marquee brands like Neutrogena, and considering selling many others including Clean & Clear, Maui Moisture, Neostrata, its German baby care brand Bebe, and Japanese brand Dr.Ci:Labo.

With Perry at the helm now, Kenvue has a leader who is  a veteran of Procter & Gamble, and intimately familiar with periodic portfolio resets that activists have clamored for.

But Kenvue’s shares barely budged after the CEO and strategic overview news. That suggests investors are not expecting Perry—or whoever becomes permanent CEO—to turn things around quickly.

The green light came after a last-minute thumbs-up from Ald. Scott Waguespack, 32nd, clearing the way for an approval from the full City Council. Waguespack’s endorsement also means Sterling Bay will avoid challenging the city’s long-standing tradition of aldermanic prerogative, which typically gives local aldermen the final word on zoning decisions in their ward.

Sterling Bay recently agreed to several major changes to its proposal, bringing an abrupt end to a yearslong battle with Waguespack, who originally said the $350 million development at 1840 N. Marcey St. was out of scale with the surrounding neighborhood.

“We are pleased with the approval of 1840 N. Marcey, which was a result of extensive community input and engagement that enhanced this proposal to what it is today,” said Sterling Bay Principal Fred Krol in a prepared statement. “The advocacy by labor and affordable housing advocates helped to showcase the real strength and benefits of this $350M investment. It is a win-win for Chicago, and we look forward to bringing the project to life.”

Sterling Bay plans to construct 16- and 19-story skyscrapers on the site, near the CTA’s Red Line and sandwiched between the Bucktown neighborhood and the Clybourn Corridor retail district. The complex will provide around 600 total apartments, including 124 affordable units.

The developer had originally proposed taller buildings, as well as 360 parking spaces, igniting opposition from many local homeowners. But after negotiations with Waguespack, it agreed to shorten the structures and drop the number of parking spaces to 147.

“While it’s not, you know, perfect, it’s enough to get it over the hump,” Waguespack said. “We were trying to make sure that there was community input. That’s the No. 1 thing.”

The project, which had the support of Mayor Brandon Johnson, first won approval from the Chicago Plan Commission in June 2024, but it later stalled in the Zoning Committee after Waguespack spoke out against it.

Sterling Bay then announced it would try the first-everend-runaround an alderman through a 2022 zoning reform. Known as Connected Communities, it allows developers proposing large amounts of affordable housing in high-cost, transit-rich areas such as Lincoln Park to get an up-or-down vote from the City Council, even if the local alderman opposes the project.

Aldermanic prerogative was a contentious issue throughout much of Tuesday’s zoning meeting. After a raucous debate, committee members voted 13-7 to support Johnson’s proposal to expand citywide a pilot program allowing the construction of coach houses and“granny flats”without requiring burdensome zoning changes.

Many aldermen complain that the plan, which still needs full City Council approval, would loosen their control over development in their wards. Waguespack said they had a point.

“(Aldermanic prerogative) is a very important aspect of governing in Chicago,” he said. “It really gives people in the communities the front seat in trying to determine what is good urban planning in this city.”

Sterling Bay has put forward a lot of ambitious proposals, some unsuccessful, for the Near North Side. It surrendered control earlier this year of the 53-acre Lincoln Yards megadevelopment site, a mostly vacant stretch of land along the North Branch of the Chicago River just south of 1840 N. Marcey St., after failing to secure enough investment to kick off construction of a $6 billion community. Chicago-based JDL Developmentsaid last weekit had an agreement to purchase the northern half of Lincoln Yards and wants to launch a scaled back residential development.

No one spoke against Sterling Bay’s 1840 N. Marcey St. proposal during the Zoning Committee’s public comment period. Several North Side residents said the city sorely needed new housing, so they supported both 1840 N. Marcey St. and new granny flats.

“This is an incredible step for Chicago residents and for those who want to move to Chicago,” said Joshua Chodor, a graduate student and resident of the North Side’s Ranch Triangle neighborhood. “(1840 N. Marcey St.) will also bring some much needed life to the area.”

Software developer Tasnim Tanveer said it’s now much harder to find affordable apartments than when she moved to Chicago 10 years ago, and green-lighting new developments will help new residents live near public transit.

“It will allow young people to set down roots in Chicago the way I did,” she said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-beaten-down-growth-stock-003800618.html,2025-07-16 11:15:00,Yahoo Finance,"PayPal's stock has plummeted 76% from its all-time high of $310.

With a 71% penetration rate in the U.S. payment app market, PayPal is a leading choice for digital payments.

CEO Alex Chriss is shifting the focus from just payments to a broader commerce platform and reducing checkout times by 32%.

10 stocks we like better than PayPal ›

Shares ofPayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL)have certainly taken investors on a roller coaster ride in recent years, mostly descending into the depths of disappointment.

The stock soared to dizzying heights as everyone piled into fintechs in 2021. However, the party came to an abrupt end as the pandemic's tailwinds faded and the Federal Reserve tightened its grip by raising interest rates, sending the stock into a downward spiral.

Today, PayPal is 76% below its all-time high price of $310 per share and has traded in a range between $50 and $95 over the past couple of years. It is priced at a cheap valuation, and under CEO Alex Chriss, who took over in 2023, the company is looking to reignite growth and get back on track. Here's why investors may want to consider this fintech giant today.

PayPal grew a lot during the pandemic, adding customers at a staggering pace as digital payment adoption accelerated. Its rapid growth had investors paying a steep premium for the stock. At that time, the fintech was valued at as much as 109 times earnings and as much as 16.9 times sales.

Investors were highly optimistic about its prospects, but the company was unable to deliver, and the stock took a massive hit instead. With shares well below their peak, they trade at reasonable valuations today: a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 2.39 and aprice-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of 16.7. At these valuations, investors are showing little optimism about the company.

The company has a few things working in its favor. It has one of the most-used payment apps in the U.S., with a 71% penetration rate, according to Morning Consult. In a survey by Motley Fool Money, 85% of respondents who use digital payment apps said they use PayPal, significantly outpacingBlock's Cash App (54%), which was second.

The fintech continues to grow steadily, too. Last year, revenue rose 7% to $31.7 billion, while its diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.99 were up around 4% year over year. However, to warrant a higher valuation and grab investor interest, PayPal will need to improve its margins and accelerate its growth.

Under Chriss, the company aims to transform from payments to a comprehensive commerce platform. Part of this approach is to create a ""winning checkout"" by accelerating the rollout of an upgraded online checkout,with its Fastlaneoffering playing a key role.

According to the company, this one-click solution significantly reduces checkout times by 32%. It boosts conversion rates for merchants and is an integral part of its small and medium-size business (SMB) strategy.

Other recent news that could bode well for PayPal is the recent stablecoin initiatives in the U.S. The Senate recently passed the bipartisan Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act for short), which provides a framework for regulating digital tokens pegged to the value of assets. The bill requires full reserve backing for issuers, monthly audits, and money laundering safeguards, among other regulations.

PayPal was one of the first major financial institutions to enter the stablecoin market with the launch of its PayPal USD dollar-backed stablecoin (PYUSD) in 2023. The coin is pegged to real-world assets, including U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasury notes, and other similar cash equivalents. PayPal has even used its stablecoin for business-to-business payments, including transactions with Ernst & Young andAlphabet's Google.

PayPal views PYUSD as a tool to help connect the traditional economy and Web3. Chriss said that the company is committed to enabling a ""commerce-ready ecosystem"" through PYUSD for cross-border transfers, vendor payments, payouts, and bill paying. This is one way the fintech is looking to spur growth and stay ahead in the highly competitive and evolving payments landscape.

PayPal is working to reignite growth, and its stablecoin is one part of the puzzle. The company is integrating PYUSD into more products to help facilitate faster, cheaper payments for merchants. This can help lower costs in cross-border transactions and improve the back end of payments, which tends to rely on older infrastructure.

And it will continue to push and improve its SMB offerings with the PayPal Complete Payments platform and grow its digital advertising business, too, as it aims to expand its commerce platform.

The stock is relatively cheap, and the company is undertaking several initiatives that I think have the potential to spur growth. It guided for gross profit to grow 5%, while adjusted EPS growth will be around 8% at the midpoint this year.

Management is targeting what it terms a ""low teens-plus"" EPS increase by 2027 and has aspirations for 20%-plus EPS growth in the longer term.

I think PayPal is worth taking a chance on. Its cheaper valuation gives some margin for safety if growth doesn't pick up. And if it can reignite growth, it could lead to a revaluation and send the stock higher from here.

OKLAHOMA CITY – A man who faced execution nine times and had his conviction vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court is asking a judge to enforce what he says is an agreement between him and the state’s attorney general that could set him free immediately.

But while Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office acknowledges that there were discussions about a plea deal with Richard Glossip, they said no formalized agreement was reached.

Glossip’s attorneys though said Drummond in 2023 agreed to let the then-death row inmate plead guilty to accessory after the fact and receive a 45-year sentence in connection with the 1997 killing of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese, according to court documents filed Wednesday.

With good time credits, Glossip would be eligible for immediate release, his legal team said.

In return, Glossip, who was twice convicted and sentenced to death for paying another man to kill his boss, would not seek damages from the state, the filing said.

The agreement is an enforceable lawful contract, the filing argues.

Glossip’s attorneys said the plea agreement was agreed upon before the U.S. Supreme Court decided to consider the case. In February, the nation’s highest courtdetermined Glossip’s constitutional rights were violated because prosecutors withheld evidence that would have aided his defense.

The nation’s high courtvacatedthe conviction, a move Drummond supported.

Last month, Drummond said Glossip would not face the death penalty, but would be re-prosecuted with non-capital murdercharges. He was seeking a life sentence, Drummond said then.

Drummond’s office said in court filings Wednesday that it wasn’t until June 28, four months after the nation’s high court ruled, that Glossip’s lead attorney suggested there was a binding agreement. They said it was never executed.

A plea bargain is not binding on either party unless and until the court accepts it, the state argued.

“Contrary to defense counsel’s abrupt, new theory, the parties have never reached a plea agreement in this matter,” the state’s filing said. “Defense counsel premises the existence of a supposedly binding agreement on an email exchange between himself and Attorney General Drummond on April 1, 2023.”

In addition, Drummond could not have lawfully approved a plea agreement without consulting the victim’s family, the state’s filing said.

The victim’s family has criticized Drummond for advocating for clemency and his handling of the case. Drummond said although he didn’t think Glossip was innocent, he didn’t get a fair trial.

The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board in 2023 declined to recommend clemency. Glossip is being held in the Oklahoma County jail after being transported from Oklahoma State Penitentiary, while awaiting a new trial.

The man who confessed to beating Van Treese to death, Justin Sneed, is serving life without the possibility of parole. Sneed has said Glossip paid him to kill Van Treese.

(Via STORMTOOLS)

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined his second multistate lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration this week, signing on to a 20-state challenge against the dismantling of a key disaster mitigation program.

Thesuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, means to undo the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Under BRIC, FEMA funds states, tribes, and local government projects that help fortify people and property against natural disasters. Funding can go toward things like flood barriers, building reinforcements, improving wastewater infrastructure, or hardening electric grids. The funds can also be used to prepare emergency plans or identify hazards within communities. FEMA typically covers up to 75% of a project’s cost, although smaller, rural communities can receive up to 90%.

In a statement Wednesday, Neronha said the program’s termination could hurt Rhode Island’s coastal communities.

“There’s no denying that Rhode Island is particularly susceptible to the ever-increasing effects of climate change, which is why we need to stay ahead of the curve on mitigating risk,” Neronha said.

This is the Attorney General’s27th legal effortagainst the Trump administration since January. Neronha is not a co-leader on Wednesday’s suit, unlike the onefiled Mondayin Rhode Island over education funding cuts. The suit is co-led by Attorneys General Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts and Nick Brown of Washington.

Other attorneys general involved are from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, as well as the governor of Pennsylvania.

Since opening for applications in 2020, BRIC has funded over 2,000 projects with about $4.5 billion in funds. According to the lawsuit, the University of Rhode Island has been using BRIC money to develop a modeling tool for flood risks in Rhode Island’s coastal and inland waters. The project was allocated for fiscal years 2020 through 2023 and was awarded$976,488across multiple BRIC grants, according to a January 2025 presentation made by the tool’s developers to a legislative study commission on climate change. The lawsuit cites a $348,978 grant for one project as being endangered by the BRIC termination.

“URI’s BRIC project cannot move forward without BRIC funding,” the lawsuit reads. “As a result of the termination of the BRIC program, Rhode Island will have less data and information regarding inland flooding and inland flood risk.”

The lawsuit alleges that BRIC’s suspension violates the separation of powers as well as the Administrative Procedure Act. Lawsuits against the Trump administration over funding cuts have frequently employed similar arguments.

“The President understands that he and his Administration do not have the power to unilaterally withhold Congressionally allocated funding to the states, and yet here we are again,” Neronha said in his statement.

The lawsuit also argues that the elimination of BRIC defies theAppointments Clauseof the Constitution. The official who ended the program — Cameron Hamilton, who served as acting administrator of FEMA from January until hisfiringin May — “was never nominated to serve as FEMA Administrator, nor was he confirmed by the Senate,” according to the suit.

FEMA, which is itself an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately return a request for comment about the lawsuit Wednesday. The agencyposted a noticeabout the program’s termination to its website on April 4, although the link now returns a “Page not found” error as of this writing.

A cachedversionof the memo stored on Archive.org reads, “The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.”

AnApril 16 memoclarified that FEMA would cancel applications for the 2024 funding cycle, as well as all BRIC projects not yet obligated from fiscal years 2020 through 2023, and annul obligated projects yet to begin construction. Unspent funds, which FEMA cited at over $3.6 billion, would be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund. The advisory noted that FEMA would craft a new mitigation strategy that is “more responsive to state and local requirements.”

Wednesday’s lawsuit claims that the abrupt termination of funding “has caused serious harm” as states are not able to move forward with projects and will end up wasting time, effort and money.

“Each day that passes causes more harm and increases the chances that these projects will not be able to go forward, as communities face expiring permits, escalating costs, and eroding stakeholder trust,” the suit reads.

FEMA’s efforts to harden communities against disaster began with pilot programs in the late 1990s, and were formalized in 2002 with thePre-Disaster Mitigationprogram, which also offered subsidies for mitigation. In response to Hurricane Katrina a year prior, Congress passedlegislationin 2006 that furthered mitigation funding as one of FEMA’s key functions. In 2018, legislationreformedFEMA offerings to make them more consistent, and in September 2020, the first applications for the BRIC program opened.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/west-bottoms-business-owners-ask-230859462.html,2025-07-17 02:00:00,West Bottoms business owners ask for help after property tax hike,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Business owners in the West Bottoms are calling for help from city and state officials for their county property taxes.

Now that the appeals deadline has passed, the president of the Historic West Bottoms Association says that they are running low on options and running out of time, while some owners are facing six-figure tax payments that haven’t been budgeted for.

“We understand taxes. We understand the need to generate revenue for the county with all these improvements that have been promised,” said the association’s President, Tom Esselman.

“But the steepness of the increases were so abrupt and they were so uncommunicative.  Some of them are as “low” as 300%. We have one of them that’s over 1,000% increase, ten times what they paid last year in this year’s tax bill.”

Missouri making changes to temporary tag, vehicle registrations next month

At Blip Coffee Roasters, they saw an increase of 626% in their assessment.

“I would love to speak to any business owner, CEO, or executive of any of any business who can say with a straight face that they were able to raise their costs onto their customers by, you know, 600, 700 or 1,000% overnight and expect their customers to be coming back,” said Ian Davis, owner of Blip.

Davis says the officials he’s spoken with at the county have been “not helpful. We’re trying to run businesses, own property, employ people,” he said.

“You know, we are Kansas City. We are the city. When people visit here, these are the places they want to come to.”

Both Davis and Esselman say that if there’s not a viable solution to the tax increase soon, businesses may be forced to close.

“You guys want to bring the draft here. You want to develop the areas, you want to bring the World Cup here. You want storefronts full of people. You want customers,” said Davis.

“That’s who and what we are. And all we’re hearing is we’re not going to get any help. And this is going to result in the closure of businesses and the sale of properties by the ownership that are here now.”

That’s why Esselman wrote a letter from the association asking for help from city and state officials to help find a solution for vulnerable businesses.

“We want to raise awareness among the other elected officials that we’ve always worked with and who have always supported the West Bottoms at the city and at the state level to say, how can we work together as a group of elected officials to support businesses that are really, truly vulnerable?” he said.

“At the end of the day, they represent us and we need to hear from them,” Davis said.

“So if Jackson County isn’t going to help us at all, if Jackson County isn’t going to move off of these tax assessments, if they’re not going to, you know, allow for a longer ramp-up process for these types of payments, fine. Let’s hear from the city. Let’s hear from the state. Tell me to my face that we must sell our property.”

Esselman says he’s meeting to discuss the assessments with Jackson County officials this week, but says that he has a lot of questions for city and state officials.

“Are there grant programs? Are there credits that can be created? Is there some way we can pool our funds collectively at the state and the city and the county level to make available relief, emergency relief, just like what we did when COVID was around?” he asked.

“Taxation is supposed to be fair and reasonable. And when it’s not, we’ve got to find ways to fix it. Let’s find some funding that can help some of these smaller businesses get that done. While there’s more of a transparent review of how can we make this better as a process going forward.”

Davis says that if they don’t get help, then everyone in Kansas City and Missouri will feel the effects.

“Collectively, we want to run good businesses. We want our buildings to get fixed up. We want to support our community. We want to pay our fair share of taxes,” he said.

“We also want to stay in business. We also want to, you know, support our families. And we’re not going to be able to support our staff. We’re not going to be able to stay in business, or own property in the county, if this is how they treat their constituents.”

Comey, as it happens, embodied several unlikely coincidences within the administration. First and foremost she is the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired in 2017 over the bureau’s investigation of the president’s alleged ties to Russia. She also worked on the federal case against Jeffery Epstein before his death by an apparent suicide in 2019, and later led the successful prosecution against Epstein’s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Diddy Trial Lead Prosecutor – and James Comey’s Daughter – Fired by Trump DoJ

It’s unclear if Comey was fired specifically over the outcome of the Combs trial. But according to ABC News, Donald Trump has privately expressed anger about having a member of the Comey family working in his administration. The failure to secure conviction against the rap mogul on all but 2 minor charges may have provided justification.

Combs faced multiple serious charges that could have seen him sentenced to life in prison. But on July 2, the jury found him not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges, and only convicted him on two minor prostitution charges.

Epstein meanwhile is back in the news due to a major schism within the Republican Party caused by the abrupt declaration last week from Attorney General Pam Bondi that the billionaire sex offender never kept a list of clients or other incriminating blackmail information. Just months earlier Bondi declared authoritatively that she was in fact in possession of that list and would release it soon.

Since then, Trump himself has attempted to downplay or even dismiss Epstein’s importance, and core supporters have since been rocked by infighting even at the highest levels of the party. For examples, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino reportedly threatened to step down over Bondi’s claim, and several prominent right wing media personalities have argued bitterly over the matter.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/lack-trust-mattoon-community-powering-012050404.html,2025-07-17 04:15:00,‘Lack of trust’; Mattoon community powering through second ‘do not drink’ order,"MATTOON, Ill. (WCIA) — Sunday’s glimmer of hope came to an abrupt end Tuesday night in Mattoon. Two days after the initial “do not drink” order was lifted, another one was put in place following IEPA testing.

This time around, toxic algal bloom levels were higher than what prompted the first “do not drink” order last Thursday.

UPDATE: Mattoon do not drink order ‘may continue’ for 3-4 days

Community members said while they know the city is working to combat this issue, they could also work on communication. Genna McCaslin said she and others who live slightly outside the city have gotten some emergency alerts to their phones, but not consistently.

McCaslin said she’s relied on social media and news outlets more than the city to keep her informed. She did not get an alert about the reissued order on Tuesday.

“I think the biggest thing for our family is just the lack of trust that we have now, and just trying to restore that trust,” McCaslin said.

Kelli Armes, who lives in the Village of Gays, said she’s never gotten an alert to her phone from the initial order until now.

While the city has been posting regular updates on Facebook, Armes said officials shouldn’t rely on that as their main way of getting the word out. She said people, whether they’re in the city limits or not, should get emergency alerts to their phones if they’re affected.

Mattoon tap water ‘not safe to use’ due to harmful algae bloom, could ‘result in illness’

“Some people do not have Facebook, maybe they don’t even watch the news, but the elderly need to know through some type of communication that there is some type of issue,” Armes said. “This could be very harmful to them, especially the ones that are sick or ailing for some reason.”

Communication is key for families like McCaslin’s, who has an immuno-compromised daughter. McCaslin said that on Tuesday, prior to the initial “do not drink” order, her daughter’s liver levels were higher during routine testing.

Knowing what she does now about the drinking water situation, she wonders just how long the issue had been developing.

“There are children in our area that are immuno-compromised, and that’s really sad to learn via Facebook that this problems causes issues, so sorry it’s just a little frustrating,” McCaslin said.

Aside from the health and communication concerns, the reissued order also poses problems for restaurants.

While some have chosen to close, others like Great Food & Spirits have stayed open from the start. They’ve replaced their usual dishes and silverware with single-use plastic to keep.

While it’s allowed them to keep their doors open, manager Rob Perry said it’s an unexpected financial burden.

“It’s just the cost of doing business,” Perry said. “It’s not only that, it’s the water filters, it’s the ice you’re throwing away, it’s also the cleansing and the sanitation. It’s a lot of extra work, but it’s still worth it. That has to happen because we don’t want sick folks.”

Although it may seem like a lot of bad news, there is still some good to be found. Just like during the first order, Lytle Park and Williams Elementary School are passing out water and filling up jugs.

Lytle Park Superintendent Jacob Fryman said they’ve given out tens of thousands of gallons over the last few days. When he learned that the city was back in need of water, he said there was no shortage of volunteers willing to help out.

PREVIOUSLY: Lytle Park now the main water distribution center in Mattoon

“It’s just been wonderful for the community  to come together,” Fryman said. “I’ve [gotten] to know a lot of people. It’s been a great opportunity to host, but it’s been awesome distributing the water… It’s also the relationships we make with people and we’re all wishing each other the best and stay hydrated, all the things.”

An emergency alert was sent out Wednesday afternoon saying the current water conditions could continue for the next three to four days. It said, per IEPA, two consecutive positive tests results are required before lifting the advisory.

WCIA has been working to talk with the IEPA and the Coles County Public Health Department, but has yet to hear back. We will continue to share updates as we learn more.

The firing of Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was reported byThe New York Times,PoliticoandNBC News, with each outlet citing numerous unnamed sources.

The reason for the abrupt firing was unclear, but it comes amid fractures erupting within President Donald Trump's far-right, conspiracy-believing base over his administration's reluctance to release files related to the Epstein case.

Epstein, the disgraced wealthy financier, died by suicide in 2019 in his Manhattan jail cell as he was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges in connection with allegations of running a child sex-trafficking ring. His death, as well as his association with celebrities, including Trump, has led to rampant conspiracy theories. The files, some contend, contain evidence that some of Epstein's high-profile associates also participated in his alleged sex crimes.

Trump, who was a friend of Epstein from the late 1980s until the early 2000s, and his administration have been battling criticism, including from his own Make America Great Again base, over not releasing the files. Early this month, the Justice Departmentreleased a memostating there is ""no incriminating 'client list'"" and that ""there was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions."" It also states that Epstein died by suicide, an assertion supported by video footage though three minutes were not available.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, a known conspiracy theorist, reportedly feuded at the White House following the memo's release, with Bongino stating he might resign in response.

Bongino and his boss, FBI Director Kash Patel, had been prominent voices supporting the full release of the Epstein files.

Trump on Wednesday attempted to deflect the issue as one being pushed by Democrats, stating ""Their new SCAM is Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,"" while describing conservatives who are demanding the files be released as his ""PAST supporters.""

""All these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein HOAX,"" he said onhis Truth Social media platform, claiming the issue was taking attention away from his ""successes.""

""I don't want their support anymore!"" he said.

To reporters on Tuesday, Trumpclaimed the Epstein fileswere ""made up"" by James Comey, former President Barack Obama and former President Joe Biden.

Comey's firing is the most high-profile exit from her Manhattan office since February,when several federal prosecutors resignedafter the Justice Department ordered criminal corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams to be dropped.

Comey, who earned her law degree from Harvard, had worked at the Southern District of New York office since 2015. Along with the Epstein case, she had worked on the federal cases against Epstein's close associate, Maxwell, who was sentenced in 2022 to 20 years behind bars, and Combs, who was convicted on two counts of prostitution charges earlier this summer and is now awaiting sentencing.

In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court in Palm Beach County to two felony charges: soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution.

He was sentenced to an 18-month sentence, but served only 13 months, mainly under a work-release program.

In 2019, he was arrested again on federal charges of sex trafficking minors in Florida and New York."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/colorado-rules-pet-care-businesses-025245663.html,2025-07-17 07:00:00,New Colorado rules for pet care businesses concern small groomers,"Update, July 18:After this story aired, Jennifer Foreman was able to get in touch with PACFA and have her questions answered. A department spokesperson said Foreman does not need any additional licenses to operate her grooming business, and that a refund was issued for a license she was not required to obtain. PACFA says it is committed to working with license holders through the transition and welcomes continued stakeholder feedback.

Original story, July 16:DENVER (KDVR) — New state rules are now in effect for pet care businesses across Colorado — impacting groomers, dog daycares, shelters and boarding facilities.

The changes fall under the Pet Animal Care and Facilities Act, or PACFA, and were enacted by the Colorado Department of Agriculture on July 15. State leaders say the updates are aimed at improving animal welfare — but some small business owners say the rollout was rushed and confusing.

“We got an email yesterday at 3, and it said effective tomorrow,” said Jennifer Foreman, owner of Praise the Paw Dog Grooming in Denver. “These rules make more sense for corporations, not little mom-and-pop shops. It feels like they’re running us out of business.”

The updated regulations outline new requirements for staffing levels, vaccine recordkeeping, and cleaning protocols. They also clarify how dogs from different households can be housed or handled together, particularly in grooming settings where dogs may interact off-leash.

“Some of the grooming facilities were letting their dogs run while they are grooming dogs,” said Nick Fisher, Section Chief for the PACFA Program. “So part of it is a supervision right, but the other part is a cleaning and sanitation issue.”

According to Fisher, the rules went through a standard rulemaking process and are the first significant overhaul in several years. He says the department is focused on education and offering time for facilities to come into compliance.

“Within the rules, the facility has an opportunity to correct a violation,” Fisher said.

Still, Foreman says the changes feel abrupt, and she’s not alone in feeling left out of the process.

“I think if you’re going to make rules like this they should be voted on by the grooming community,” she said. “Somebody who understands what happens in a grooming salon on a day-to-day basis should be involved.”

She also says communication with the state has been lacking.

“I really don’t know what that entails yet. No one’s reached out to me, I’ve emailed, no one’s gotten an email back,” Foreman said.

The Department of Agriculture has published a detailed guide to help facilities understand the new expectations. That guide, along with the full text of the PACFA rules, can be found on theColorado Department of Agriculture’s website.

For most pet owners, the impact will be minimal, as long as their pets are current on vaccinations. But for those running pet care businesses, the new requirements could mean adjustments to operations, staffing, and layout.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/early-construction-begins-reimagined-little-132910033.html,2025-07-17 16:00:00,Early construction begins on reimagined Little Italy food hall,"SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) – As early construction begins, the vision for the reimagined Little Italy food hall is coming into focus just months after its abrupt closure.

Tucked away in the European-inspired Piazza della Famiglia on Date Street–between India Street and Columbia Street–is a quiet corner.

After it closed in February, the lively food hall that once occupied the space is no longer part of the scene and it caught locals off guard.

“I would go in after I go to the farmer’s market, so I was really surprised when it closed,” said Cathy Vu, who works in the area.

The 4,685-square-foot space is cooking up a fresh start.

“So much historic value in this area and such close-knit community that it was important for us to put some revitalization into reopening the project,” said Tiger Hospitality CEO, Jim Krieger.

Krieger and his team are leading the transformation, which will include a new centrally positioned bar that connects the indoors with the plaza.

The new food hall will fit 85 to 100 people and feature five culinary concepts, including one with a focus on fresh pasta hand-made daily in an area that used to be the old bar.

Dining options will also include smash burgers from cosmos burgers, a taste of the ocean from Lobster Lab, and healthy eats from La Vida, concepts already featured at the Windmill food hall in Carlsbad, in addition to pizza.

“We want to bring some different vibe of the pizza. It’s going to be a Detroit deep dish pizza concept in there,” said Tiger Hospitality Partner, Eren Unur.

Aside from local craft beer and cocktails, diners can expect a soft serve ice cream cart for the sweet tooths just outside.

The Tiger Hospitality team is partnering with BASILE Studio who are the design creatives behind Born and Raised and Morning Glory, among others.

Beyond dining, the revitalized space will serve as a vibrant cultural hub with daily live cooking demos, music performances, holiday celebrations, and seasonal events to activate the Piazza, which received 1.1 million visits in 2024.

“People can come in and enjoy a night out and an experience,” said Krieger.

The operators said while the early build-out and design is currently underway, they expect to open in late fall or early 2026.

Meanwhile, anticipation over the final product will continue to build.

“Little Italy has a history with the Italian fisherman so it would be nice have a new eatery that features the history of the neighborhood that’s very unique to San Diego,” said local resident, Maria Talag. “And every time I have people come visit, I like to show them and tell them about the unique history.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-justice-department-wants-no-190546087.html,2025-07-17 19:30:00,US Justice Department wants no prison time for ex-officer convicted in Breonna Taylor raid,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department is recommending an ex-Kentucky police officerconvicted of using excessive forceduring the deadly Breonna Taylor raid should serve no prison time, an abrupt about-face after spending years prosecuting the former detective.

Brett Hankison is the only officer who fired his weapon the night of the March 2020 botched drug raid who has faced criminal charges. His shots didn't hit or injure anyone, though they flew through Taylor's walls into a neighboring apartment.

A federal judge will decide Hankison's sentence, which could amount to several years, on Monday at a hearing. But if the judge heeds the Justice Department's request, it would mean that none of the Louisville police officers involved in the botched raid would face any prison time.

The Justice Department, which has changed leadership under PresidentDonald Trumpsince Hankison's conviction, said in a sentencing memo this week that ""there is no need for a prison sentence to protect the public” from Hankison. Federal prosecutors asked the judge to sentence him to time already served, which amounts to one day, and three years of supervised probation.

Prosecutors at his previous federal trials aggressively pursued a conviction against Hankison, 49,arguing that he blindly fired 10 shotsinto Taylor's windows without identifying a target. Taylor was shot in her hallway by two other officers after her boyfriend fired from inside the apartment, striking an officer in the leg.

But in the sentencing memo, federal prosecutors wrote that though Hankison's “response in these fraught circumstances was unreasonable given the benefit of hindsight, that unreasonable response did not kill or wound Breonna Taylor, her boyfriend, her neighbors, defendant’s fellow officers, or anyone else.”

Activists who protested in the streets after Taylor's death in 2020 seized on the narrative that under the Department of Justice recommendation, Hankison would serve just one day in jail for the conviction.

Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who helped Taylor's family secure a $12 million wrongful death settlement against the city of Louisville, said the Justice Department's recommendation “is an insult to the life of Breonna Taylor and a blatant betrayal of the jury’s decision.”

“Recommending just one day in prison sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity,” Crump said in a statement on social media.

Shameka Parrish-Wright, who marched in numerous protests and ran for mayor after Taylor's death, called the Justice Department's memo “a devastating slap in the face.”

“To those directly impacted and to everyone who understands the broader systemic failures this case revealed, one day behind bars does not suffice,” Parrish-Wright, now a Louisville city council member, said in a media release. “This is not justice.”

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Hankison’s conviction “warrant a serious prison sentence.”

A presentence report from the U.S. Probation Office said Hankison should face a range of 135 to 168 months imprisonment on the excessive force conviction, according to the memo. But federal prosecutors said a number of factors — including that Hankison's two other trials ended with no convictions — should greatly reduce the potential punishment.

The memorandum was submitted by Harmeet Dhillon, the chief of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and a political appointee of Trump, who in Maymoved to cancel settlements with Louisville and Minneapolisthat had called for an overhaul of their police departments.

In the Taylor case, three other ex-Louisville police officers have beencharged with crafting a falsified warrant, but they have not yet gone to trial. None of them were at the scene when Taylor was shot.

The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked racial injustice protests nationwide that year.

A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison in 2023, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/senators-criticize-cfpb-dropping-action-191842110.html,2025-07-17 20:00:00,Senators criticize CFPB for dropping action on troops’ overdraft fees,"Eight Democrats in the Senate have expressed “profound alarm” about theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau’sdecision to terminate aconsent orderinvolving Navy Federal Credit Union’s alleged overcharging of overdraft fees.

Under the CFPB’s original order issued in November 2024, Navy Federal agreed to pay at least $80.2 million in restitution to its members who were allegedly charged overdraft fees on their accounts unfairly. TheCFPB issued a termination noticethis month for that November order, without stating a reason.

Neither Navy Federal nor the CFPB responded to questions from Military Times about how much restitution — if any — had been provided to members of the credit union. Its membership is mostly made up of service members, veterans and their families.

The settlement reached in November 2024 wasn’t clear about firm deadlines for paying restitution.

CFPB also didn’t respond to questions about why the consent order was terminated.

In a letter Wednesday to Russell Vought, President Donald Trump’s budget director and the acting director of the CFPB, the eight senators asked for an explanation for the termination. Among other requests for information, they want to know how much of the funds for restitution remains unpaid to affected consumers. They want answers by July 30.

CFPB’s July 1 decision to terminate the consent order “appears to prioritize financial institutions over the very service members the Bureau is charged with protecting,” the senators wrote. “The restitution funds intended to compensate harmed consumers are now at risk of being withheld.”

The original consent order alleged that Navy Federal charged customers surprise overdraft fees on certain ATM withdrawals and debit card purchases, even when customers’ accounts showed sufficient funds at the time of the transactions. In addition to the $80.2 million in restitution, CFPB ordered Navy Federal to pay a $15 million civil penalty to the CFPB’s victims relief fund, and to stop charging illegal overdraft fees.

In that consent order, CFPB stated Navy Federal officials neither admitted nor denied any of the CFPB’s allegations.

In a statement to Military Times, Navy Federal officials defended their overdraft program and said they supported CFPB’s latest decision.

“Navy Federal complied with all applicable laws and regulations at the time and continues to do so,” Navy Federal said in the statement. “We firmly believe CFPB’s decision to terminate the order was appropriate.”

They stated their overdraft program “allows our members to make necessary, everyday purchases without going into long-term debt or turning to payday lenders.”

Navy Federal is the largest credit union in the U.S., serving active-duty military, veterans, Department of Defense civilian employees and their families, of all branches of service. The credit union has nearly 15 million members and $190 billion in assets, according its website.

In 2024, the credit union took over the operation of the DOD’s Community Bank locations located on 60 overseas military installations.

In the November consent order, CFPB stated that starting in 2017, Navy Federal received complaints from consumers expressing anger and confusion about overdraft fees charged, even though their available balances were high enough to cover the transactions at the time they were authorized.

Navy Federal officials began investigating some of the overdraft issues as early as June 2018 and made changes to their overdraft policies starting in September 2020, according to the November order.

The senators, led by Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., noted that on April 16, CFPB pledged in a press release to “focus its enforcement and supervision resources on pressing threats to consumers, particularly service members and their families and veterans.”

But the senators contend the abrupt reversal of the consent order suggests the credit union’s “stated commitment to service members is little more than lip service.”

In addition to Gallego, the letter was signed by Sens. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

The senators asked how the action to terminate the consent order aligns with CFPB’s publicly stated priorities.

Among other questions, they asked how much of the $15 million originally designated for the CFPB victims relief fund was actually deposited. They also want to know whether affected consumers were notified about the termination of the consent order and that restitution requirements might be altered or withdrawn.

Democrat lawmakers and advocacy groups have expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s moves to cut back on CFPB’s work. In the nearly six months since the administration has had control of the bureau, its leadership has focused almost exclusively onrolling back any punishments, fines and penaltiesmade against companies during the Biden administration, The Associated Press reported."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-charged-hijacking-small-plane-200818182.html,2025-07-17 21:15:00,"Man charged with hijacking small plane shut down a large airport for ideological reasons, police say","A Canadian man has been charged with hijacking a small planethis weekand flying it over one of the busiest airports in Canada, prompting fears he would crash into something and causing flights to be delayed or grounded.

It began Tuesday at a flight school at Victoria International Airport, about 40 miles south of Vancouver, when 39-year-old Shaheer Cassim “threatened a flight instructor” and took control of a Cessna 172 aircraft, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

The plane belongs to the Victoria Flying Club, which operates about 12,000 flights a year, including sightseeing tours, charters and discovery flights.

“We’ve had people bang a wing tip into another plane, you know, fender benders … I mean, all of that stuff happens when you run a flight school because you are teaching people to fly,” club president Colin Williamson told CNN newsgathering partner CBC. “But this? No, never. It’s just completely out of the blue.”

He said the hijacker showed up and said he wanted to be a passenger on a flight.

After allegedly commandeering the small aircraft, Cassim took off by himself and flew north to Vancouver International Airport. He circled the runways, forcing nine other planes to divert and prompting controllers to warn aircraft to watch out for him.

“Encore 3584, the International’s been shut down due to terrorist activity,” a controller told a WestJet regional pilot in audio from LiveATC.net. “What is your alternate?”

“There is some type of protest going on above the airport with a Cessna,” another controller radioed multiple planes. “In case anything starts heading towards you, you have the ability to move at your discretion.”

Cassim acted with “an ideological motive to disrupt airspace,” police spokesperson Sgt. Tammy Lobb said in a statement.

Police did not say what he was protesting, however, CNN newsgathering partner, CTV, identified a social media account from a man with the same name who was a pilot in the area.

“I am a messenger of Allah. I am the messiah sent to save humanity from climate change and usher in an era of world peace,” the Facebook post said on Monday, the day before the hijacking. “The Arctic sea ice is going to disappear within two years. When that happens, huge amounts of methane are going to erupt from the Arctic Ocean, triggering abrupt runaway global warming, turning Earth into Venus.”

The North American Aerospace Defense Command scrambled fighter jets, but the Cessna safely landed before they arrived and Cassim was arrested.

Cassim appeared in court on Wednesday to face one count of hijacking. The judge ordered him to remain in jail until his next court appearance on July 22. The court currently does not have a lawyer listed for him.

UnderCanadian law, the crime of hijacking includes using force or threats of force to cause an aircraft to change from its flight plan.

Instead, he says, heaccepted the postas interim NYPD commissioner in September because he genuinely wanted to lend a hand.

“I have a great admiration and love for the NYPD. I knew they were having some issues and I wanted to bring my experience to help the rank and file,” said Donlon, 71. “I knew what I was walking into.”

What he found, he says, was “a lot of dysfunction” in the top leadership of the NYPD.

“Everyone was just doing what they wanted to do,” he says. “The feds have much better systems and structure. But they just didn’t get it.”

On Wednesday, Donlonfiled a lawsuitthat accuses Mayor Adams and top NYPD officials including former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, current Chief of Department John Chell, former top spokesman Tarik Sheppard and Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry ofrunning a “corrupt enterprise.”

In an interview withWPIXThursday morning, Sheppard responded by claiming Donlon was “isolated” from the start because “his phones were taken by the FBI.”

Sheppard also claimed, “He (Donlon) was showing many signs of some cognitive issues that he wasn’t up to the task of being police commissioner.”

But in the wide-ranging interview with The News, Donlon showed no signs of any cognitive problems.

“He’s just grasping at straws, it’s pathetic,” Donlon said, revealing a little of the city edge honed in his Bronx upbringing. “Of course he’s defaming me. But he’s used to getting his way all these years.

“Just about every day I was police commissioner, I was out in the community. Weekends. I never took a day off,” he said. “So, no, I wasn’t isolated. And no, the FBI never took my phones.”

Reps for the NYPD and Adams did not reply to requests for comment on Sheppard’s claims. City Hall spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak Wednesday described Donlon as a “disgruntled former employee who proved himself ineffective.”

“This suit is nothing more than an attempt to seek compensation at the taxpayers’ expense,” she added.

Donlon’s FBI career intersected with a number of the major federal gang and terror cases of the 1990s, including the1993 World Trade Center bombing, and theManila Air casewhich was masterminded by Ramzi Yousef who was also involved in planning the 9/11 attacks.

He retired in 2005 and later worked forstate Homeland Securitybefore forming a consulting company.

He says Mayor Adams instructed him to clear his initiatives with him, but “If I did a good job, I would become full police commissioner.” But he was immediately at a disadvantage from top subordinates like Maddrey, Sheppard, Chell and Daughtry.

“The core of the issue was I had no control over them,” he says. “Adams is protecting them. They know if they screw up they are not going to be in trouble.”

Donlon says he witnessed behavior among the top brass that would never be condoned in the FBI.

“You would be fired,” he says. “The lack of candor, the lying. In the FBI you would be gone the next day.”

In his first staff meeting, he directed all social media posts be cleared with NYPD legal.

“I said we need one voice here, we can’t act like cowboys,” Donlon said. “What do they do? They run over and complain to Adams. If I was up to me, I would have gotten rid of them.”

At one point, Daughtry told Donlon he thought up a prostitution task force from Roosevelt Avenue in Queens “in a dream.”

Donlon proposed bringing the feds in to use their power to make larger narcotics and sex trafficking case that would really stick. Chell, Daughtry and Maddrey didn’t want the feds involved.

“It was all about getting credit, it was all about them,” he says. “But it’s not about them. It’s about the community.”

Donlon came into office intending to examineevidence storage in the NYPD warehouses.

“I walk into Erie Basin, it was a disaster,” he says. “There were boxes all piled up in no kind of order. Maddrey was livid, Adams was livid. I said ‘What’s the problem? I’m doing my job.”

Soon after he took office, the FBI served a search warrant on him for documents from 30-year-old terror investigations. Donlon says he had had no contact with sensitive federal documents since he retired.

He says the documents were so old any restrictions on them had lapsed. “It was all generic stuff. If they had anything they would have charged me,” he said. “They also told me they did this because they thought there might be something with me and Adams,” he said. “But of course there wasn’t.”

On Nov. 20, he was called to City Hall for a conference. He says when he saw Jessica Tisch, he knew he was going to be replaced. The mayor had him sit down.

“He wasn’t very nice. I think he was mad about the warehouse thing,” Donlon says. “He says ‘If you want to stay (in city government), stay. If you want to go, go. He was very abrupt, not nice.”

Donlon recalled a previous meeting where he briefed the mayor as Adams perused a document, disinterested. “When I was done, there was no response and then he just said, ‘Anything else?’” Donlon said.

Donlon departed the department skeptical of whether the top leadership was really prepared to deal with a major disaster.

“They were cowboys, they just didn’t really know what they were doing,” he said.

He also thinks the department is insensitive to the needs of the rank and file.

“You can’t treat people like robots; they have lives,” he says. “These guys need some care and compassion.”

But Donlon opted to stay on in City Hall working on law enforcement grants, until he was dismissed in April. “I still wanted to stay involved in law enforcement and public safety and I wanted to keep working,” he says.

Donlon remains angry about the treatment his wife received when she was detained for two hours in the 17th Precinct after a fender bender on the East Side on Dec. 16.

Almost immediately, the private cell numbers for Donlon and his wife Deirdre O’Connor-Donlon were leaked to the media.

“That was Tarik. That was put out to hurt me,” Donlon says, an allegation contained in his lawsuit. “They should have just given her a summons at the scene and let her go. It was very very upsetting to be treated this way.

In the end, Donlon, after much consideration, decided to file the lawsuit.

“I have a high tolerance level but for me to sit back and take this guff was unbearable,” he said."

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined another challenge to President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday, aligning himself with 20 other states in a lawsuit against recent federal rules surrounding health coverage purchased viaAffordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces.

Thesuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, argues that aJune 25 final ruleissued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would make health care harder to access under the ACA, especially for transgender people.

The rule, set to take effect Aug. 25, heightens eligibility requirements and narrows the open enrollment window for health plans purchased through state marketplaces. Some consumers who previously qualified for $0 premiums could possibly see new monthly charges on their health plans.

“We expect these actions will provide immediate premium relief to families who do not qualify for Federal premium subsidies and reduce the burden of improper ACA premium subsidy expenditures to the Federal taxpayer,” the rule reads.

Neronha lambasted the new rule as “unnecessary and irresponsible” in a statement Thursday.

“We should be making it easier, not harder, for Americans to obtain health care coverage,” Neronha wrote. “And yet, this Administration is intent on making life harder for everyday Americans while lining the pockets of the ultra-rich.”

The lawsuit is seeking a preliminary injunction to block the law from becoming active before the Aug. 25 start date. The lawsuit is co-led by Attorneys General Rob Bonta of California, Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, and Matthew Platkin of New Jersey.

Signed onto the suit are attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, plus the governor of Pennsylvania.

Neronha performed a hat trick this week, joining three lawsuits against the Trump administration across four days. On Monday, Neronha co-led a casefiledin Rhode Island over education funding. On Wednesday the AG allied himself with a blue state coalition hoping toundo cutsto a disaster preparedness program. Overall, Neronha has joined or co-led28 lawsuitsagainst the Trump administration since January.

The lawsuit argues that the final rule would cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their health insurance, and it would increase premiums, copays and deductibles for millions more.

“We know millions are already expected to lose health coverage under the President’s recent legislation, which cuts $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next 10 years,” Neronha added. “Now, with this final rule, over a million more could be one medical emergency away from bankruptcy.”

According to Neronha’s office, health insurer HealthSource RI estimates the rule would reduce enrollment in the Ocean State by 3%, or about 1,380 people.

The CMS rule also strikes drug therapies like hormone or puberty blockers used in gender transition-related care from the federal roster ofessential health benefits. That would mean states who decide to subsidize such treatments would need to rely on their own coffers, rather than federal ones, if they mandate coverage among state health plans. These drugs fell under the banner of gender-affirming care in the Biden years, but the new CMS ruling prefers the label “specified sex-trait modification procedure” and distinguishes such medication from other non-pharmaceutical or non-surgical therapies.

The lawsuit argues that the final rule’s “sweeping changes” will remove “States’ substantial autonomy to set their own policies” when it comes to health care marketplaces. It additionally argues that the “abrupt decision to exclude services … on the very basis of gender identity is highly disruptive” and will disproportionately affect transgender and gender non-conforming people.

“Notably, the only individuals who might seek services with the express purpose of aligning their gender identity and their body, and their gender identity differs from their sex, are transgender individuals,” the lawsuit reads, quoting language used in the federal law.

An hour after the attorneys general announced their lawsuit, CMS issued itsown press release. Although not specifically in response to the lawsuit, the agency defended imminent changes to ACA plans as measures that will “crush fraud, waste, and abuse in America’s healthcare programs.”

The agency wrote that a recent software-led analysis of historical enrollment data found that, in 2024, nearly 2.8 million Americans were improperly enrolled in multiple public insurance programs, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans purchased on ACA marketplaces. The agency says ending duplicate enrollments could save approximately $14 billion annually in taxpayer spending.

“The Biden Administration struggled to ensure that individuals were only enrolled in the single Medicaid or Exchange plan for which they were eligible, that ends today,” CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “CMS is restarting these important checks to follow federal law. We are going to work with states to identify individuals enrolled in multiple programs and fix the duplicate enrollment problem to save taxpayers billions of dollars, while minimizing inappropriate coverage loss.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/canadian-man-charged-hijacking-caused-014009471.html,2025-07-18 02:30:00,Canadian man charged with hijacking that caused security scare at Vancouver airport,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — A Canadian man has been charged with hijacking a small plane after he caused a security scare at Vancouver’s airport this week.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Thursday Shaheer Cassim, 39, has been charged with hijacking, constituting terrorism, over the incident Tuesday that saw the North American Aerospace Defense Command scramble F-15 fighter jets before the plane safely landed.

The RCMP said he seized control of a Cessna at Victoria International Airport on Vancouver Island by threatening a flight instructor, before flying about 40 miles (64 kilometers) to Vancouver.

“Investigators have determined the suspect acted with an ideological motive to disrupt airspace,” said Sgt. Tammy Lobb in a statement late Wednesday.

A man with the same name and who resembles Cassim posted on social media that he was a “messenger of Allah” and a “Messiah” sent to save humanity from climate change.

He said “the Angel Gabriel appeared before me and gave me a message from Allah.”

Cassim’s last post warns about “abrupt runaway global warming” that will cause humans to go extinct within a few years.

Cassim also said in the post that he is “Sam Carana,” who runs the “Arctic News” blog that describes itself as a place where contributors “all share a deep concern about the way climate change is unfolding in the Arctic and the threat that this poses for the world at large.”

His Facebook profile says he was employed from 2008 to 2010 by now-defunct KD Air, a small airline based on Vancouver Island.

The airline’s former owners, Diana and Lars Banke, said in an interview Wednesday that Cassim was one of the smartest and best pilots they ever worked with, calling him a fast learner who was highly intelligent.

But Lars Banke said Cassim left the airline after getting “bored” and then went to medical school. He also said Cassim believed the world was coming to an end.

Diana Banke said she was “very surprised” to hear of Cassim’s charges, saying he was quite young when he worked for them and was “like a kid.“

Lars Banke said he recalled that Cassim was somewhat interested in environmentalism, but he was unaware of any kind of religious beliefs.

“He never spoke religion with us,” Diana Banke said.

“I’m really surprised that he would’ve done something like this,” she added.

In 2012, Cassim held a news conference before going on a cross-country bicycle ride to raise awareness for global warming.

British Columbia Premier David Eby said when asked about the incident Thursday that it was a “bizarre moment,” and the fact that it ended without a more significant disruption at the airport is a “testament” to the skill of responders who talked the suspect down."

Ronald Arthur Burdick, 45, of Burkburnett, was indictedby a Wichita County grand jury for the murder of Michael Randall, who died from a gunshot wound to the head on the morning of June 9, 2023, on Sheppard Road.

Ajury of five men and seven women was seated on Monday, July 14, 2025, in the 30th District Courtroom, with Judge Jeff McKnight presiding. A recap of previous proceedings can be found below:

Day 1 — Jury seated, testimony begins in Ron Burdick murder trial

Day 2 — Testimony resumes in Wichita Falls murder trial

Day 3 — Victim’s brother testifies in Ron Burdick murder trial

Prosecuting the case on behalf of the state is Jarret Noll, of the Wichita County District Attorney’s Office, with Kyle Lessor assisting. Jeff Eaves, a Wichita Falls defense attorney, is representing Burdick, with the assistance of Colin Jordan.

PREVIOUS STORY: Victim’s brother testifies in Ron Burdick murder trial

If convicted, Burdick faces a punishment range of 5 to 99 years, or life in prison. Before his trial began, Burdick elected to have his sentence set by the jury.

Proceedings in Burdick’s trial resumed on Thursday, July 17, 2025, at around 9 a.m., with Noll recalling Sgt. Eric Wisch with the Wichita County Sheriff’s Office. Sgt. Wisch began testifying on Wednesday afternoon, July 16, but was released from the stand to accommodate the schedule of another witness from outside the area.

Sgt. Wisch previously testified that he responded to the scene of the deadly shooting at Lindemann Welding on Sheppard Road and worked as one of the investigators.

The jury was shown a video recording of an interview between Burdick and Sgt. Wisch. During the interview, other WCSO detectives also questioned Burdick regarding the fatal shooting of Randall.

During the interview, Burdick said that Randall made a lunge for his gun from inside the pickup. Burdick told authorities during the interview that he apologized to Randall’s brother, who was inside the pickup and witnessed the fatal shooting.

Noll questioned Sgt. Wisch about his custodial interview with Burdick after the video concluded. Sgt. Wisch testified that during the interview, Burdick seemed “unusually calm” for someone who was involved in a life-or-death struggle. He testified that he did not observe Burdick showing any signs of remorse for shooting Randall.

Noll questioned Sgt. Wisch about a statement made by Burdick during the interview, in which Burdick indicated that he had been threatened by Randall. Sgt. Wisch testified that during the course of his investigation, he found no evidence on Burdick’s phone to corroborate that Randall had made any death threats against Burdick.

Sgt. Wisch testified that in his experience, a suspect may exaggerate certain details during an interview in order to minimize the perception that they acted in a criminal manner.

PREVIOUS STORY: Day 2 of Ron Burdick murder trial underway in Wichita Falls

Sgt. Wisch testified that Burdick seemed to shift the blame from himself to Deputy Patrick Bradford, who testified on Wednesday as well. Sgt. Wisch testified that Burdick seemed to suggest that Bradford had instructed him to keep Randall at the scene by any means necessary.

Sgt. Wisch testified that while reviewing a text message conversation between Burdick and Randall, he observed an exchange about Randall’s car, which Burdick had towed from the parking lot of Lindemann Welding.

Sgt. Wisch testified that Randall texted, “Either way, you’re paying for this,” and while Burdick perceived this as a threat, Sgt. Wisch perceived the text to mean that Randall expected Burdick to pay the cost of recovering Randall’s car.

Sgt. Wisch testified that several details of the crime scene that he observed contradicted Burdick’s statement that Randall was hanging out of the window of the pickup while the truck was moving forward.

“The statement that was given did not match the evidence that I observed at the scene,” Sgt. Wisch testified.

Sgt. Wisch testified that he observed no visible defensive wounds on Burdick, suggesting that there was no struggle between Randall and Burdick before Burdick shot him. He also testified that he didn’t observe any blood on Burdick’s clothing, suggesting that he wasn’t within a foot of Randall when he shot him.

Sgt. Wisch also testified that Randall was discovered inside the pickup sitting in an upright position and holding an envelope in his hands. He testified that if there was a struggle, he would’ve expected to find Randall in a different position.

Sgt. Wisch also testified that Burdick’s act of approaching the pickup and knocking on the window contradicted his previous statement that he was in fear of Randall. He also testified that Burdick never said that Randall touched his firearm, just that he’d lunged for it.

Eaves then cross-examined Sgt. Wisch, questioning him on his experience dealing with subjects who’d used methamphetamine. Sgt. Wisch testified that in his experience, people who were high on methamphetamine tended to act more aggressive and fidgety, adding that in a “fight or flight” situation, they’d often choose “flight”.

Sgt. Wisch testified that while individuals using methamphetamine tended to be more volatile and unpredictable, it didn’t necessarily mean that the individual would be more violent.

Eaves questioned Sgt. Wisch regarding Randall’s autopsy results, asking if he was aware of the toxicology results. Sgt. Wisch testified that he was not, but that he knew that Randall had an issue with using methamphetamine.

Sgt. Wisch also testified that he did not doubt that there was a heated verbal exchange between Randall and Burdick on June 9, 2023, before Randall was fatally shot by Burdick. He testified that Burdick never denied shooting Randall.

Sgt. Wisch also testified that given the chaotic nature of the shooting, it would not shock him if Russell Randall, Michael Randall’s brother, who witnessed the fatal shooting, did not immediately recall every detail of “a chaotic, traumatic event”.

On re-direct examination from Noll, Sgt. Wisch testified that verbal provocation did not give a person the right to use deadly force, and that a person doesn’t lose the protection of the law just because they had methamphetamine in their system.

At around 11:45 a.m., after Sgt. Wisch was released from the witness stand, Judge McKnight dismissed the jury for a lunch break. At around 1:30 p.m., the jury was called back into the courtroom. Noll, on behalf of the prosecution, rested the state’s case.

Judge McKnight notified Eaves that the defense may call its first witness. Eaves recalled Sgt. Wisch and briefly questioned him. Eaves then called a co-worker of Burdick, who also testified for a short time.

PREVIOUS STORY: Jury seated, testimony begins in Ron Burdick murder trial

The next witness called to testify on Burdick’s behalf by Eaves was the defendant’s wife, Lisa Burdick. She testified that she was at Lindemann Welding on June 8 and 9, 2023.

Lisa Burdick testified that she and Benny Lindemann, owner of Lindemann Welding, were friends, and that she and her husband would often help Lindemann with doctor’s appointments.

As Eaves questioned Lisa Burdick about the events of June 8 and 9, 2023, Noll made several hearsay objections when Mrs. Burdick would begin to testify regarding what someone else said. Judge McKnight instructed Mrs. Burdick not to include statements made by others in her testimony.

Lisa Burdick testified that on June 9, 2023, Lindemann’s daughter, Cami Thornton, asked her to place Randall’s final check outside, and that Randall would be by to pick it up later that morning. She testified that WCSO Deputy Patrick Bradford, who testified on Wednesday, instructed her to place the envelope in a blue bucket on Lindemann’s property. She testified that Ron Burdick was with her at that time.

Lisa Burdick testified that after she placed the envelope in the bucket, she saw a black truck pull onto Lindemann’s property. She testified that once the truck stopped, Randall got out of the truck and picked up his check.

Lisa Burdick then testified that when Randall leaned down to the bucket, he turned and looked at her. She began to tear up as she testified regarding what Randall said to her. Noll again made a hearsay objection, which was sustained by Judge McKnight.

Lisa Burdick testified that Randall spoke to her and made her uneasy. She testified that he was acting aggressively and she would never forget the face he made at her. She testified that he cursed at her, but when she began to testify regarding what Randall said, Noll again objected.

Judge McKnight then dismissed the jury for a brief recess. Judge McKnight then instructed both attorneys regarding how they were to proceed with objections made during testimony. He then instructed Lisa Burdick once again not to include what another person said in her testimony.

After the jury returned to the 30th District Courtroom, Noll cross-examined Lisa Burdick. During the prosecution’s cross-examination, several exchanges between Noll and Mrs. Burdick became tense and heated.

Noll asked Lisa Burdick if she had a vested interest in the outcome of the trial. When Mrs. Burdick responded, “He’s my husband,” Noll objected that the witness was being nonresponsive. Judge McKnight instructed Mrs. Burdick to only answer the question asked by the attorney.

Noll then asked Lisa Burdick if she would ever come into court and say anything against her husband. On multiple occasions, Mrs. Burdick testified that it was self-defense. Each time, Noll objected that the witness was nonresponsive.

On multiple occasions, Judge McKnight instructed Mrs. Burdick to listen carefully to the questions being asked and answer them.

Noll then asked Mrs. Burdick if she had asked Lindemann’s daughter not to tell police about an assault rifle on the property that belonged to her husband.

After several tense exchanges between Noll and Mrs. Burdick, many of which included objections from Noll, Judge McKnight halted proceedings and dismissed the jury from the courtroom for a second time.

While the jury was still outside the courtroom, Judge McKnight instructed Mrs. Burdick once again to only answer the questions that were asked by the attorneys. Judge McKnight said that if an attorney needed more information from her, they would ask follow-up questions, adding that counsel for the defense will have the opportunity to ask more questions if needed.

PREVIOUS STORY: Man indicted for murder in shooting on Sheppard Road

Judge McKnight admonished Mrs. Burdick that if she could not follow that instruction, she might be removed from the courtroom and held in contempt of court, which is a felony offense.

As Judge McKnight was admonishing Lisa Burdick, Ron Burdick, who was seated next to his defense counsel, collapsed to the floor. Members of the gallery stood, many with expressions of shock and concern on their faces, and several audible gasps were heard in the courtroom.

Lisa Burdick ran from the witness stand over to her husband. She asked a member of the gallery to get her bag, which contained medicine for her husband. She was heard describing her husband’s apparent medical episode as a seizure.

Judge McKnight asked the members of the gallery to exit the courtroom at around 2:45 p.m. Within minutes, first responders arrived at the 30th District Court to provide medical attention. Eventually, Burdick was wheeled from the courtroom on a stretcher.

Testimony in Burdick’s trial was set to conclude for the week on Thursday, regardless of how the day ended, in order to accommodate the 30th District Court’s weekly criminal hearing docket, typically conducted every Friday.

While proceedings were initially set to resume on Monday, July 21, 2025, Burdick’s health might delay when testimony will resume.

As of the publication of this story, it is unclear when testimony will resume in Burdick’s trial.

When testimony resumes, Burdick’s defense will continue calling witnesses to testify on his behalf. As is the case with all defendants on trial for felony offenses, Burdick has a right under theFifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitutionnot to testify.

After Burdick’s defense rests its case, the prosecution will have the opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses to testify, if they so choose. After both sides have rested and the prosecution is given the opportunity to call rebuttal witnesses, both the prosecution and the defense will close the case.

PREVIOUS STORY: Victim and suspect identified in Sheppard Road shooting

Once the case is closed by both sides, they must prepare the charge instructing the jury on how to proceed with its deliberation. Once the charge has been finalized, it will be read to the 12 men and women of the jury.

Both the prosecution and the defense will then have the opportunity to present final arguments to the jury. The prosecution has the opportunity to address the jury first, followed by the defense. The prosecution also has the opportunity to address the jury once again after the defense’s closing argument concludes.

After closing arguments are completed by both sides, the jury will then begin deliberating until they’re able to return a unanimous verdict.

The singer has reportedly put his $31.5 million settlement with Braun and his former company, HYBE Corporation, on hold. As per the source, the pop icon is relying on his wife’s billion-dollar Rhode deal settlement to move forward.

Justine Bieber might not settle his multimillion-dollar debt with former manager Scooter Braun and his former company, HYBE Corporation, anytime soon. A source has revealed that the singer is reportedly depending on his wife, Hailey Bieber’s Rhode deal payout to clear his debt.

An insider toldTMZthat the pop icon will not clear his $31.5 million debt until the funds from Hailey’s recent multibillion-dollardealwith e.l.f. Beauty is securely in the bank. The Rhode’s sale, valued at approximately $1 billion, will likely close “probably in a month or two.” Till then, the “Baby” singer is ready to wait for the settlement.

Although with the Rhode deal, it’s the model who will get the majority of the money, Justin will get some amount too, since he is an investor in the company. As per the report, the 31-year-old singer will get $50 million cut from the sale.

In May, an independent audit determined that the dad of one owes millions to Braun and his then-company HYBE due to the abrupt cancellation of his 2022 “Justice” world tour. The pop sensation was forced to cancel his tour after developing Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which caused facial paralysis.

At the time, HYBE paid AEG $26 million to cover the costs associated with the cancelled tour. As part of their settlement, Justin has agreed to pay the South Korean entertainment company, HYBE, the full $26 million. He has also agreed to half of the remaining commission debt, totalling approximately $31.5 million.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami. It seeks at least $10 billion in damages.

On Thursday,the Wall Street Journalpublished a story describing a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein’s 50th birthday.Donald Trumpdenied writing the letter, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory.”

Earlier Friday, theJustice Department asked a federal courtto unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein’s case amid heightened public interest in the disgraced financier’s connection to Trump and other leaders, and as controversy continues to surround the Trump administration’s handling of records related to Epstein.

Trump in recent days has called his own supporters “weaklings”for vying for more records from the Epstein probe.

Here's the latest:

Trump casts lawsuit against Wall Street Journal as part of his efforts to punish news outlets

The lawsuit over The Wall Street Journal’s reporting on a letter the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a birthday album for Epstein accuses the paper and its reporters of having “knowingly and recklessly” published “numerous false, defamatory, and disparaging statements.”

On Friday, Trump posted on his Truth Social site: “This lawsuit is filed not only on behalf of your favorite President, ME, but also in order to continue standing up for ALL Americans who will no longer tolerate the abusive wrongdoings of the Fake News Media.”

A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal’s publisher, responded, “We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.”

Both ABC and CBS have previously reached multimillion-dollar settlement deals with the president after he took them to court.

Trump says keeping promises is key to a stronger Republican majority in Congress

Trump heaped praise on the lawmakers at a White House dinner, telling them that no one has done what they’ve been able to accomplish, “and we did it all in six months.”

He ticked through legislation he has signed into law and said the Republican Party will have an “incredible record” to share with voters over the next 18 months.

“As long as we continue to keep our promises to the voters, Americans will continue to stand by our side and into 2026, the Republican majority, I think, is going to be stronger in both the House and the Senate,” he said.

Trump sues Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over reporting on Epstein ties

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami on Friday. It seeks at least $10 billion in damages.

Trump promised a lawsuit after The Wall Street Journal on Thursday described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein’s 50th birthday. Trump has denied writing the letter, calling the story “false, malicious, and defamatory.”

The letter was reportedly collected bydisgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwellyears before the wealthy financier was first arrested in 2006 and subsequently had a falling-out with Trump.

The Wall Street Journal describes the contents of the letter but did not publish a photo showing it entirely or provide details on how it came to learn about it.

Hegseth tells lawmakers about plan to detainimmigrantsat two bases

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey can temporarily house detained immigrants without affecting military readiness.

He notified members of Congress from both states this week of the proposal.

Trump has moved to aggressively detain and deport people in the country illegally, a push that has swept up large numbers of immigrants, including many with no prior criminal records, and forced federal authorities to find places to house them.

Hegseth said the presence of the detainees wouldn’t negatively affect the bases’ operations or training. Officials haven’t said when detainees could begin arriving at the facilities or if other military bases are under consideration.

What might be in the grand jury transcripts in the Epstein case?

The transcripts could include witness testimony and other evidence presented by prosecutors during court proceedings. They are rarely released, unless they need to be disclosed in connection with a judicial proceeding.

The Justice Department says it will work with prosecutors in New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personally identifying information before transcripts are released.

Even with the department’s endorsement, it could take weeks or months of legal wrangling to decide what can be released and how to protect witnesses and other sensitive victim information.

Justice Department asks court to unseal Jeffrey Epstein grand jury records

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche filed the motion urging the court to release the transcripts a day after President Trump directed the Justice Department to do so.

The Trump administration has been embroiled in controversy since the department last week announced it would not be releasing any more evidence in its possession from the Epstein investigation.

Trump’s demand to release the grand jury transcripts came after The Wall Street Journal reported on a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Epstein’s 50th birthday.

Trump denied writing the letter, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory.”

EPA eliminates research office, fires thousands of employees

The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday it is eliminating its research and development arm and reducing agency staff by thousands of employees.

The Office of Research and Development has long provided the scientific underpinnings for EPA’s mission to protect the environment and human health. The agency said Friday it is creating a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions that will allow it focus on research and science “more than ever before.″

EPA is eliminating thousands of jobs after a series of voluntary retirements, buyouts and other departures in recent months. Total staffing will go down to 12,448, a nearly 23% reduction from January when President Trump took office.

Venezuela releases jailed Americans in swap for deported migrants

Venezuela has released 10 jailed Americans in exchange for getting home scores of migrantsdeported by the United Statesto El Salvador months ago under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The arrangement Friday represents a diplomatic achievement for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, helps President Donald Trump in his goal of bringing home Americans jailed abroad and lands El Salvador a swap thatits president had proposed months ago.

“Every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Hegseth says all three Iranian nuclear sites ‘obliterated’ by US strikes

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed claims that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities failed to destroy their targets.

Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon ahead of a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Hegseth said the three nuclear sites were “obliterated” by the strikes.

“The more we report and the more we see, the more we understand how devastating those attacks were on all three of those nuclear sites,” Hegseth said.

A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessmentsaid Iran’s nuclear program was set back only a few months afterAmerican strikes on three sitesin June. But Trump and other top national security officials have disputed that conclusion, with Trump saying the sites were “completely and fully obliterated.”

Trump signs stablecoin bill into law

Trump said the new law means the future of crypto and the crypto industry “is going to be stronger and bigger and better than ever before.”

Numerous members of Congress joined him at the White House for the event.

“We’ll sign this and get onto the next battle,” he said.

Trump says he backed crypto during campaign ‘for the votes’

The president lavished praise on crypto leaders during his speech, saying “nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time.”

Speaking of the industry, Trump said, “It’s good for the dollar and it’s good for the country. That’s why I backed you at an early stage.”

Then the president made a candid admission about the political calculus — “And I also did it for the votes,” he said, drawing laughter from the audience.

Trump jokes that stablecoin bill was named after him

Trump opened the bill-signing ceremony by joking that one of the bills was named after him.

“The GENIUS Act, they named it after me,” he said at the White House.

California sues the Trump administration for pulling $4B for the state’s high-speed rail project

The California High-Speed Rail Authority says the Federal Railroad Administration made an abrupt decision to end the funding agreements. The federal government should have collaborated with the authority to address concerns over thelong-delayed project, the suit alleges.

The project’s price tag exceeds $100 billion, more than triple its estimated cost in 2008, when voters approved a bond to help pay for it.

The Trump administrationannounced its final decisiontopull the fundsearlier this week. Authority CEO Ian Choudri called the move illegal.

“This is no time for Washington to walk away on America’s transportation future,” he said in a statement.

But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the authority had proven it could not build the bullet train on time or on budget.

“It’s time for this boondoggle to die,” he said earlier this week. “President Trump and I will always fight to ensure your tax dollars only go to projects that accomplish great, big, beautiful things.”

The U.S. Transportation Department and Federal Railroad Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

One big, beautiful dinner?

The president is hosting Republican senators at the White House for a dinner Friday night to celebrate the recent passage of the party’s massive tax-and-border bill.

The purpose of the dinner, noted on Trump’s daily schedule, was confirmed by two people who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private gathering.

The White House declined to comment.

USDA terminates contracts with foreign researchers following review

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it has dismissed about 70 contractors from foreign countries such as China following a national security review.

“The individuals working on these contracts from countries of concern will no longer be able to work on USDA projects,” the department said.

The announcement came more than a month after Sen. Tom Cotton, R.-Arkansas, introduced a bill seeking to ban federal funding for laboratories or research centers that have nationals from China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, or North Korea working on agricultural research.

Patrick McCann, press secretary for Cotton, said the senator believes that “nationals from adversarial nations like Communist China have no business working for our nation’s federal agencies.”

“This is especially true when it comes to our food supply chain and national defense,” McCann wrote in an email.

Sen. Cotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today wrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requesting information about any contractors that employee people in China to perform services for U.S. defense systems.

Jamie Lee Curtis speaks out against Colbert cancellation

“They’re trying to silence people, but that won’t work. Won’t work. We will just get louder,”the actor,who has previously criticized Trump and is set to visit Colbert’s show in coming days, told the AP.

CBS said “Late Show” was canceled for financial reasons, not for content. But there’s no ignoring Colbert’s relentless criticism of Trump and his denunciation of the $16 million settlement offered to Trump while the parent company’s sale awaits federal approval, said Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift.”

“If CBS thinks people are just going to swallow this, they’re really deluded,” Carter said.

GOP using ‘transparency’ as their message on Epstein. Democrats call it a ‘fig leaf’

“The House Republicans are for transparency, and they’re looking for a way to say that they agree with the White House. We agree with the president. Everything he said about that, all the credible evidence should come out,” HouseSpeaker Mike Johnsonsaid as demands to release sex-trafficking case files threatened to derail the recission vote.

Democrats vehemently decried the GOP resolution’s lack of force and pushed their own legislation, with support from nine Republicans, that would require the Justice Department to release more information on the case.

Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern called the Republican resolution “a fig leaf so they can move on from this issue.”

Under pressure from his own GOP members, Johnson had to demonstrate action on the Epstein files or risk having Republicans support the Democratic measures that would force the release of nearly all documents.

Trump gloats over Colbert’s ‘Late Show’ cancellation

The president applaudedCBS’ decision to end “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”next May.

“I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings,” the longtime target of Colbert’s comedy and criticism posted on Truth Social.

Colbert has led the late-night network competition for years. CBS has said “Late Show” was canceled for financial reasons, not for its content. But the timing — three days after Colbert criticized a legalsettlement between Trump and Paramount Globalas the CBS parent company seeks approval for a merger — led two U.S. senators to publicly question the motives of the cancellation.

Trump’s post also took shots at late-night hosts on ABC and NBC, and declared that Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld “is better than all of them combined.”

Third former Biden aide declines to answer House GOP questions about his age

Annie Tomasini, a former Biden White House deputy chief of staff, cited her Fifth Amendment rights in declining to answer questions from the House Oversight committee.

Tomasini was subpoenaed by House Republicans to testify about Biden’s age, alleged cognitive decline and the use of the autopen for executive orders, pardons and the signing of laws in the previous administration.

Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., vowed to press on. The committee has scheduled interviews with nine more former Biden administration officials in the coming weeks, and hasn’t ruled out requesting that members of Biden’s family or Vice President Kamala Harris appear to answer questions.

Trump appointees pushed the Fed building marble now under White House attack

Trump has looked to the marble finishes in a $2.5 billion renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters toclaim groundsto fire Chair Jerome Powell, with whom he has tussled for years over interest rates. But all that marble followed pressure from Trump appointees.

As the Fed moved forward with plans to renovate its Great Depression-era headquarters in Washington during Trump’s first term, its architects said the central bank had wanted glass walls to reflect the Fed as a transparent institution. Three Trump appointees called for more “white Georgia marble” instead.

Russ Vought, Trump’s top budget adviser, cited “premium marble”in a letterto Powell last week as an example of the “ostentatious overhaul.” Powellrespondedlate Thursday that “new domestic marble” would be used to address concerns.

Most US adults think the GOP tax bill will help the wealthy and harm the poor, AP-NORC poll finds

Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy.

About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect it will help the rich, according to the poll fromThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 6 in 10 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people, and about half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them.

Republicans advertisementsframe the legislationas a tax cut for all Americans. Democrats make the case that the wealthiest will benefit as Medicaid and food assistance programs are cut.

Trump’s approval rating on government spending has fallen, suggesting disapproval of how the law adds billions to the deficit.

Trump threatens to sue Rupert Murdoch over WSJ report on Epstein birthday note

Trump threatened on social media to sue the Wall Street Journal and its owners, News Corp, after the paper reported on his alleged involvement with a 50th birthday gift to Jeffrey Epstein.

The newspaper said it had reviewed a typewritten letter bearing Trump’s signature, framed by the seemingly hand-drawn outline of a naked woman, that Ghislaine Maxwell included in a 2003 birthday album. Trump denied writing the letter or drawing the picture, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory.”

Trump specifically went after its billionaire owner, Rupert Murdoch, who also owns the Fox Corporation that controls Fox News.

“I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his ‘pile of garbage’ newspaper, the WSJ,” Trump said on Truth Social. “That will be an interesting experience!!!”

Senate Intelligence Chairman seeks Pentagon review of Chinese contractors

Republican Sen. Tom Cotton is seeking an investigation into the hiring practices of Department of Defense contractors to see if they have hired Chinese citizens to perform sensitive tech work.

The Arkansas Republicanwrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Fridayrequesting information about any contractors that employee people in China to perform services for U.S. defense systems. Hiring employees living in China could unwittingly put sensitive systems and information at risk of Chinese espionage, Cotton wrote.

“The U.S. government recognizes that China’s cyber capabilities pose one of the most aggressive and dangerous threats to the United States, as evidenced by infiltration of our critical infrastructure, telecommunications networks, and supply chains,” Cotton wrote.

Cotton’s request comes after national security officials have linked China’s government to hacking campaigns targetingprominent Americansand critical U.S. systems.

For Sale: Trump is leveraging power of his office to reap profits for family businesses

If one theme has emerged in Trump’s second term, it’s how he’sleveraged presidential powerfor personal gain unlike anyone before in history.

From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election, an unprecedented flood of often shadowy money frombillionaires, foreign governments and cryptocurrency tycoonswith interestsbefore the federal government.

The dealmaking is a rejection of Trump’s first-term pledge to “drain the swamp.”

“It’s the Mount Everest of corruption” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.

Republicans grasp for response to demands for Epstein case transparency

The final House vote early Friday approving Trump’s request to claw back billions in congressionally approved spending came after hours of debate over a response to the administration’s handling of records in theJeffrey Epsteinsex trafficking case. The GOP ultimately settled on putting forth a resolution for a vote that could come next week. It nods to thebacklash from the Republican basebut carries no legal weight.

With Trump now dismissing the entire Epstein story asa “hoax” spread in part by “stupid Republicans,”the House resolution demonstrates that practically no one is moving on from Attorney General Pam Bondi’spromises to publicly release the case files.

Republican leader praises ‘fiscal sanity.’ Democrat says ‘no one is buying’ the GOP line

Republicans who approved Trump’s request to claw back about $9 billion in congressionally approved spending praised the early Friday vote as a strong move to eliminate government bloat.

“We need to get back to fiscal sanity and this is an important step,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Opponents voiced concerns about Congress ceding its spending powers to the executive branch. These cuts are just a sliver of federal spending and come after Republicans also muscled through Trump’s tax and spending cut bill without any Democratic support. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that measure will increase the U.S. debt by about $3.3 trillion over the coming decade.

“No one is buying the the notion that Republicans are actually trying to improve wasteful spending,” said Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Wall Street Journal reports a sexually suggestive Trump letter to Epstein

The president promised a lawsuit afterThe Wall Street Journaldescribed a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album for Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th birthday.

Trump denied writing the letter, calling it “false, malicious, and defamatory.” The newspaper report comes amid an uproar among Trump supporters over the administration's about-face on releasing criminal case files from the Epstein investigations.Trump has labeled “weaklings” his supporters who insist on exposing the records.

Swollen legs led to the President being diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. It’sa fairly common conditionamong older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of the swelling.

Colbert blames Trump deal for cancelation of ‘The Late Show’

CBS iscanceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert”. The talk show host told his audience that their last show will be next May, shuttering a decades-old TV institution and removing from air one of Trump’s most prominent and persistent late-night critics.

Thursday’s announcement followed Colbert’scriticismof asettlement between Trump and Paramount Global, parent company of CBS, over a “60 Minutes” story.

In his monologue Monday, Colbert said he was “offended” and joked that the technical name in legal circles for the deal was “big fat bribe.”

Paramount and CBS executives said in a statement that the cancellation “is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”

Inside the cuts to foreign aid

Among the foreign aid cuts are $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and family reunification for refugees and $496 million to provide food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts. There also is a $4.15 billion cut for programs that aim to boost economies and democratic institutions in developing nations.

Democrats argued that the Republican administration’s animus toward foreign aid programs would hurt America’s standing in the world and create a vacuum for China to fill.

The White House argued that many of the cuts would incentivize other nations to step up and do more to respond to humanitarian crises and that the rescissions best served the American taxpayer.

Recission cuts are a heavy blow to local radio stations across rural America

The cancellation of $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting represents the full amount it is due to receive during the next two budget years.

The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.

The CPB distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming.

Lawmakers with large rural constituencies voiced particular concern about what the cuts to public broadcasting could mean for some local public stations in their state.

House gives final approval to Trump’s clawing back of $9 billion in appropriated funds

The package cancels about $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and nearly $8 billion for a variety of foreign aid programs, many designed to help countries where drought, disease and political unrest endure.

The vote marked the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a rescissions request to Congress, and the White House suggested it won’t be the last. Some Republicans were uncomfortable with the cuts, yet supported them anyway, wary of crossing Trump or upsetting his agenda.

The House passed the bill by a vote of 216-213. It now goes to Trump for his signature.

This follows the federal government’s decision to dismantle the LGBTQ+ support branch of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. In his post, Pascal shared crucial resources from The Trevor Project, which continues to offer support.

Pedro Pascal recently took toInstagramto raise awareness about the abrupt end of a critical mental health program serving LGBTQ+ youth.

The actor used his platform to inform followers that the LGBTQ+ Youth Specialized Program, previously operated under the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, has been officially terminated by the Trump administration. The initiative was managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). It had offered support to over a million young LGBTQ+ individuals across the country before being discontinued.

To help bridge the gap in available mental health services, Pascal directed attention to The Trevor Project. This organization continues to provide crisis support to LGBTQ+ youth. In his caption, the actor wrote, “Counselors will still be available 24/7/365. Help close the care gap by supporting #TheTrevorProject Lifeline. Fundraising link in my bio. #988 #MentalHealth.” He also shared the group’s contact details, including call, text, and website access.

Pascal’s post has drawn praise online, with fans applauding his efforts to highlight the issue. One user commented, “Thank you for always using your platform.” Another commented, “They so lucky to have you @pascalispunk as they voice, the world needs more Pedro Pascals in the world.”

Earlier this year, Pascal joined more than 100 high-profile figures in expressing opposition to a proposed federal budget cut that targeted mental health services for LGBTQ+ youth. The draft, which was leaked in April, outlined plans to withdraw $50 million in funding allocated for suicide prevention programs connected to the national 988 crisis hotline.

The open letter drew support from a wide range of celebrities. These included Jamie Lee Curtis, Sarah Paulson, Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter, and others.

In a heated debate over the administration’s handling of the Epstein files debacle onThursday’s episodeofThe Source with Kaitlan Collins,Moreno danced around criticisms related to the scandal.

“You know what we’re not talking about, the autopen scandal,” Moreno said to Collins. “Did you guys spend 30 minutes talking about the autopen scandal? Did you spend 30 minutes talking about the fact that Democrats hid the knowledge that President Biden was compromised?”

Collins interjected to remind Moreno that her colleague, Jake Tapper, wrote a book dedicated to investigating the White House’s handling of former president JoeBiden’s alleged declining health.

“Jake Tapperwrote an entire book on it, and we covered it at length. I think you can do both things, you can walk and chew gum at the same time, senator, with all due respect,” Collins said.

Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno defended the Trump administration on Thursday evening while speaking with CNN White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins (Getty Images)

The autopen scandal refers to the belief among Republicans and the president that Biden staffersusedthe autopen to have the former president sign official documentswithout Biden’s knowledge. It’s part of their larger theory that the White House concealed evidence that Biden’s cognitive and physical health was in decline.

Biden has denied those allegations.

Moreno’s attempt to redirect the conversation from the Epstein scandal to the autopen scandal appeared unsuccessful. Collins continued to press Moreno to provide some commentary aboutTrump pulling the rug from underneath his supporters, who hoped his administration would release documents related to the government’s investigation into Epstein.

“I understand you’re argument that you’re trying to blame it on the media and Democrats, but the whole point of this scandal, which, when the president said last week, ‘I can’t believe people are still talking aboutJeffrey Epstein,’ it’s his supporters who are talking,” Collins reminded Moreno.

Despite Trump, his Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino claiming they would release the Epstein Files, theadministration put an abrupt stop to speculation last weekwhen it released a memo stating there were no extraordinary findings.

The news disappointed people who had believed conspiracy theories that the secrecy around the Epstein investigation was to prevent the public from finding out other high-profile individuals were involved in Epstein’s decades-long sex abuse and child sex trafficking scheme.

Even some Republican lawmakers who have bolstered theories about the Epstein Files have pushed for Trump to release documents in the investigation.

On Thursday, theWall Street Journalpublished a report accusing Trump of sending Epstein a birthday letter in the early 2000s that includedlewd references to sexual relations with women.The president has denied the report.

Moreno defended the president on Thursday night, calling the report “a fake story.”

Despite Collins’ best efforts to get Moreno to provide commentary about the scandal, he continued to highlight the administration’s successes and downplayed the potential impact on Trump voters who werepromised the release of the Epstein Files."

According to reports, the extreme sports icon was involved in a fatal paragliding crash in central Italy.

Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian adventurer famously known for his supersonic freefall from the stratosphere in 2012, has reportedly died at age 56. Authorities in Italy confirmed that Baumgartner lost his life following a paragliding crash in Porto Sant’Elpidio, a seaside town along the central Italian coast.

According to local police, the fatal incident occurred on Thursday when Baumgartner, flying a motorized paraglider, lost control midair and crash-landed into the swimming pool of a hotel. Eyewitnesses, including individuals in the pool at the time, watched as he fell.

Although the precise cause of the crash has not been officially confirmed, preliminary reports from local officials suggest that he may have suffered an abrupt medical complication mid-flight (viaThe Guardian).

Firefighters who responded to the scene confirmed the paraglider had struck the pool and Porto Sant’Elpidio’s mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, publicly acknowledged Baumgartner’s passing onsocial media. The mayor expressed condolences to Baumgartner’s loved ones and described the late athlete as “a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flights.”

Baumgartner became a global sensation in October 2012 with his record-breaking space jump as part of the Red Bull Stratos project. Lifted by a helium balloon to more than 24 miles above Earth, he leapt from the stratosphere wearing a pressurized suit and reached an astonishing speed of 843.6 mph.

The nine-minute descent over the New Mexico desert included a dangerous 13-second flat spin at supersonic velocity, which he managed to recover from before safely parachuting to the ground. In more recent years, Baumgartner performed aerial stunts across Europe with the Flying Bulls team.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-appointees-pushed-more-marble-144659345.html,2025-07-18 23:00:00,Trump appointees pushed more marble in Fed building renovation White House now attacks,"WASHINGTON (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumphas looked to the marble finishes and hefty price tag of the Federal Reserve headquarters toclaim groundsto fire Chair Jerome Powell, with whom he has tussled for years over interest rates. But the extensive use of marble in the building is, at least in part, the result of policies backed by Trump himself.

As the Fed moved forward with plans to renovate its Great Depression-era headquarters in Washington during Trump's first term, it faced concerns in 2020 during a vetting process involving Trump appointees, who called for more “white Georgia marble” for the facade of the building.

The Fed's architects said the central bank wanted glass walls, to reflect the Fed as a transparent institution, but three Trump appointees to a local commission felt marble best fit the building's historic character. While most of the proposed glass exterior was kept, some marble was added as a result, according to the minutes of the Commission of Fine Arts, which advises the federal government on architecture.

The marble does not explain the roughly $600 million in cost overruns for the project, now budgeted to cost $2.5 billion, which also includes the addition of an underground parking garage and new glass atria in the building's courtyards. But the roots of its extensive use further muddies the White House's attempts to use the renovation to paint the central banker as a profligate spender as a possible pretext to removing him.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if the result costs more” because of the added marble, said Alex Krieger, a Harvard University emeritus professor who was a member of the commission and participated in hearings on the Fed’s proposal.

Russ Vought, Trump's top budget adviser, cited “premium marble”in a letterto Powell last week as an example of the “ostentatious overhaul.”

Ina responselate Thursday, Powell wrote that the project would “use new domestic marble"" for several reasons, including ""to address concerns raised by external review agencies.""

The National Capital Planning Commission, which also reviewed and approved the Fed renovation project, has started an inquiry into how Powell oversaw the updates.

“The Federal Reserve’s extravagant multi-billion dollar renovation happened on the watch of the Fed’s leadership, and the Fed’s leadership needs to own up for this mismanagement of taxpayer dollars – as well as its botched coverup job,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment.

There is an uncomfortable possibility that the fate of the U.S. central bank and its foundational role in the economy hinges on a dispute about renovation costs and architecture, one that could lead a broader legal battle as to whether Trump can dismiss a Fed chair he dislikes after the Supreme Court in Maydescribed the institutionas having protections against an abrupt firing.

Trump White House investigating renovation

Trump, who has redecorated the Oval Office in gold leaf, has argued that inflation is not a concern, so the Fed can dramatically slash its rate to encourage more borrowing. But Powell and other Fed committee members arewaiting to see whether Trump’s tariffslift inflation, which higher interest rates could help blunt.

The Fed chair pushed back against criticism during aJune congressional hearingthat the renovation was lavish by saying some features were removed due to cost, leading the White House to speculate as to whether Powell deceived lawmakers or made changes to the renovation plans without getting additional approvals. At that hearing, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., also cited “white marble” as an example of extravagance.

James Blair, a White House deputy chief of staff who was recently added to the planning commission, said Wednesday that he would send a letter to the Fed requesting any revisions to the project. His goal is to see whether Powell was accurate in his congressional testimony.

“He’s either telling the truth or he isn’t,” Blair told The Associated Press. “If he’s telling the truth, he can prove it by just submitting all the plans and revisions.”

Blair told reporters Friday that the Fed offered to let them inspect the construction site at 7 p.m. that evening, but the timing didn't work and officials would like to tour the area next week.

Trump said Wednesday that he’s “highly unlikely” to try to fire Powell unless there was what he deemed as “fraud.”

The attempt to remove Powell before his May 2026 term as chair ends could unleash a devastating financial blowback, as financial markets expect the Fed, with its mission of stabilizing prices and maximizing employment,to be free of White House politicking.The perception that the central bank would use its powers to serve Trump’s political ends could lead to higher interest rates on the U.S. debt and mortgages, instead of the declines being promised by the president.

Trump appointees push for more marble

The 115-year old Commission of Fine Arts reviewed the plans for the renovation three times in 2020.

Duncan Stroik, who was appointed to the commission in 2019 during Trump’s first term, “proposed an amendment requesting that the next submission include an alternative design in white Georgia marble, the same material used for the five existing buildings along the north side of Constitution Avenue,” theminutes of a Jan. 16, 2020, meeting said.

Stroik “does not think the proposed additions defer to the historic buildings as great marble edifices on an important street,” the minutes added.

Stroik’s amendment was voted down, but the commission didn’t fully endorse the Fed’s plans. The architects presented new plans in May 2020, though those didn’t appear to satisfy Trump’s appointees.

Some commissioners “continued to object to the addition as a glass box that is reminiscent of a commercial office building, glowing at night, that would present an unacceptable contrast to the solid masonry architecture of the historic building in its monumental context,” the commission wrote in aMay 2020 letterto a Fed official.

By July 2020, however, the Fed's architects came back with a new proposal, which included “panels of white Georgia marble"" which would be used for the “base, cornice, and other details, consistent with the historic building,"" the commission'sminutes said.

Neoclassical vs. modern designs

Stroik, now a professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame, said in an interview that “stone buildings don’t necessarily have to cost a fortune.” But he acknowledged that the commission had not discussed expenses, which has not been part of its mission.

“If they wanted to play the cost game, you do a marble facade and you do the glass facade and you compare the cost,” Stroik said. “And you know, they never did that.""

Krieger, the former commission member, noted that the body’s discussions became much more contentious after the Trump administration removed several members and replaced them with Stroik and James McCrery, a professor at Catholic University, whom he said often echoed the sentiments in a then-draft executive orderfrom Trump that extolled classical architecture.

“At the time, it was a fierce battle over how literal to the original design should the renovations be,” Krieger said. “Normally, that attitude does add costs to the construction project.” McCrery declined to comment.

Trump issued theexecutive order in December 2020, which criticized modernist architecture and expressed a preference for “beautiful"" classical buildings with more traditional designs. Biden revoked the order, and Trumpreissued itthe first day of his second term.

The commission did not fully approve the Fed’s project until September 2021, after McCrery and another Trump appointee, Justin Shubow, had been removed by then President Joe Biden.

Amid intensepublic criticism around the so-called “Epstein Files”,White Houseofficials and staffers were on “a f****** warpath” to try to prevent theJournalfrom publishing the alleged lewd letter, which contained a drawing of the outline of a naked woman,Rolling Stonereported Thursday.

Trump directed his staff to prioritize the matter. Staff reportedly reached out to several contacts and pitched different angles to try to get theJournal, which is owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, to drop the story.

Ultimately, the story was published, whichonly intensified scrutinyover the administration’s handling of the files.

While Trump has not been accused of any formal wrongdoing or charged with any crime, his proximity to Epstein, someone he once called a friend, hasheightened conspiracy theories that the government is withholding documentsthat could reveal embarrassing information about high-profile individuals.

Trump and the White House havedenied theJournal’s reportabout the president’s letter to Epstein.

“The Wall Street Journal published a hatchet job article with a FAKE ‘birthday letter’ that is supposedly from 2003,” White House Press SecretaryKaroline Leavitt wrote on X.

“The WSJ refused to show us the letter and conceded they don’t even have it in their possession when we asked them to verify the alleged document they’re basing their ENTIRE fake story on,” Leavitt added.

On Truth Social,Trump wrote,“The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don’t draw pictures. I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn’t print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I’m going to sue his ass off, and that of his third-rate newspaper.”

Tension around the Epstein Files came to a head last week when the Justice Department and FBI released a memo denying the existence of a “client list” and confirming Epstein died by suicide while in federal jail in 2019.

It was an abrupt ending to the years-long saga – especially disappointing for some because Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino had all promised to release the documents at various points.

Many of those disappointed were Trump’s own supporters, including prominent conservative influencers, and online personalities who hadbolstered conspiracy theories about Epstein for years.

Despite the president’s base having a reputation for absolute loyalty to him, many have called for Bondi, Patel, or Bongino to be held accountable for not releasing the documents.

However, after the WSJ’s story was published, many of those who had hit out at the administration’s handling of the Epstein caserushed to support the president, including conservative pundit Megyn Kelly and even Elon Musk, who branded it a “hit piece.”

Trump directed Bondi to release all grand jury testimony ""pertinent"" to the Epstein investigation."

After only three years in operation but an estimated1.5 million callers served, a major LGBTQ+ youth suicide prevention hotline was shut down on Thursday, one month after the Trump administration announced it wouldend funding for LGBTQ+-specific programshoused within the national “988” service.

Since 2022, the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, which the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services runs, has worked withthe Trevor Projectto offer the “Press 3 Option,” which provided LGBTQ+ young people with access to professionals trained in working with queer youth.

The Trump administration has defended the shutdown by saying the hotline will “no longer silo LGB+ youth services”—notably erasing the “T” for transgender—to “focus on servingallhelp seekers.” But this disingenuous reasoning ignores an important fact: LGBTQ+ youth experience disproportionately high suicide rates, being more thanfour times as likelyto attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers, and thus require more tailored care.

In the context of the recent barrage of executive orders against trans people andcourt decisionsbanning gender-affirming care, as well as the burgeoningthreatsagainst same-sex marriage, the closing of the hotline cements a message that has become increasingly clear to me and millions of other queer youth: LGBTQ+ folks are not safe in Trump’s America. And now, with the loss of this crucial mental health resource, we are left feeling more fearful than ever.

“The removal of the queer youth line, and any youth line, will bluntly send people into silence and result in more fatalities. This choice terrifies me,” said Elsa Frankel, a student at Wellesley College (which I also attend). Frankel, who has called both the main 988 hotline as well as the Press 3 option in the past, explained the significance in talking with a responder who understands the needs of LGBTQ+ people. “While the adult hotline always existed, they are not trained to aptly deal with young people who are questioning their worth to live based on sexual orientation or gender. Also, the other adult lines tend to be much more crowded, abrupt or straightforward, and formulaic. Those on the other end of the queer youth line felt like common voices, like friends, and would talk with us for 30-plus minutes until we felt calmer,” she said.

Natalie Kim, a student at Wesleyan University, added that Press 3’s specialized services were especially significant to a group that has faced historical exclusion. “Being queer just made me feel more isolated. I think it was really powerful because it was specific. Someone not only cared about my mental health, but cared about my queer mental health, specifically,” Kim said.

Beyond the lifesaving resources that it offered, the hotline also stood as a symbol of acceptance for queer people from the federal government.

“The Trevor Project’s suicide prevention hotline represented a community for me that existed somewhere, however abstract. It mattered to know that there was somewhere for me: an organization with trained staff that would understand me fundamentally. That’s why I could even muster the strength to call at all,” Kim said.

As a queer young person who has called the hotline before, I can testify that Press 3 is often a last option that one turns to when they no longer feel there is someone in their life whom they can trust with their identity. With this safe space now gone, however, there is an even more urgent need for adults to express their support for the queer youth in their circles.

Zach Eisenstein, the director of communications at the Trevor Project, stresses that adults have a huge impact on the mental health of LGBTQ+ young people, and that it should not “be the onus of queer and trans young people to seek out the resources they need. It should be on the allies and the adults of these young people to figure out how to be effective allies and support systems for the queer people who need them.”

While extending support may feel daunting, the Trevor Project’s2024 U.S. National Surveyon the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ young people reveals that some of thetop ways to supportqueer youth are respecting pronouns, asking questions about identities, having or displaying Pride flags, and showing support on social media.

Rebekah Schmitt is the founder of theSage Casey Foundation, formed in memory of her child Sage, whom she lost to suicide at age 14. The organization makes an effort to connect with queer youth in Sonoma County and publicize crisis resources, but Schmitt acknowledges that “the biggest thing that we can do is keep opening conversations.”

“What kids need is someone that just says, ‘I don’t understand, but I want to, and I’m willing to hear you, and I’m willing to have that conversation.’ Just an open conversation. I mean, pronoun usage with Sage was a really big issue, but Sage didn’t care if you got it right. Sage cared if you were making an effort,” Schmitt said.

Moving forward, the Trevor Project will still offer24/7 crisis servicesfor queer youth as well as a peer support program. Numerous other lines like theLGBT National Coming Out Support Hotline,LGBT National Help Center, andTrans Lifelinewill continue to operate as well.

“I want to reiterate that no matter what decision the federal government makes now or next week or next month or next year, LGBTQ+ young people have millions,millionsof people in this country, in their corner, who want to see them live long, successful, happy lives,” Eisenstein said."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/sacramento-nonprofits-report-millions-dollars-140000510.html,2025-07-19 20:45:00,Sacramento nonprofits report millions of dollars lost due to Trump funding cuts,"Rachel Rios thought she’d pulled off a miracle. La Familia Counseling Center had just saved the jobs of its AmeriCorps members in late April after the Trump administration abruptly announced that the program was being shut down.

These members were the backbone of La Familia’s parenting classes, diaper distributions and other support services for low-income families in south Sacramento. They were students counting on their stipends to survive.

“We were celebrating that we saved them all, that we were able to keep them all till the end of the fiscal year,” said Rios, the nonprofit’s executive director.

Then a week later, another blow landed. She learned that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was terminating an $18.6 million grant for a newcommunity hub and park in south Sacramento.

La Familia’s experience encapsulates the chaos, confusion and damage rippling through Sacramento’s nonprofit sector as community-based organizations grapple with an unprecedented wave of contract reversals, rescinded funds and targeted cuts by the GOP Administration — all coming with little notice and no recourse.

“We were getting ready to build. We were getting ready to dig the ground,” said Rios, whose team had finalized architectural drawings, gotten permits from the city and lined up contractors.

Rios joined four other nonprofit leaders on stage at a town hall Tuesday, sharing startling details about how the loss of federal funds and targeted policies have affected their organizations.

Like La Familia, the Mutual Assistance Network, Folsom Cordova Community Partnership, River Oak Family Resource Center, Sacramento Children’s Home and WellSpace Health utilize dozens of AmeriCorps students provided through a grant administered by the Child Abuse Prevention Center.

Lawrence said Mutual Assistance lost half its staff when federal funding for 10 AmeriCorps students was terminated. They were crucial to the organization’s mission to work with low-income families in neighborhoods like Del Paso Heights and Arden Arcade to establish bonds that will help them overcome the academic, health and financial traps that so oftenensnare people in poverty.

While a number ofnonprofits have sued in federal court to recoverthe promised funding, local leaders said that, out of an abundance of caution, they are operating as though it’s not coming.

“I’ve never known Birth & Beyond without AmeriCorps,” she said, referring to the network of family resource centers that serve thousands across Sacramento County. “We had to figure it out. … The pivot has been real.”

The Mutual Assistance team still had to meet the same grant conditions and community needs — parent coaching, crisis intervention, even helping families get to medical appointments — while addressing surging demand for these services. Other panelists said their organizations also were seeing an increase in people seeking help.

“We are helping families that we’ve never helped before just with food,” Lawrence said. “We’re helping families that we’ve never helped before, just with transportation to get to their doctor’s appointments and so on.”

The real heartbreak, she said, is watching families disappear from public life out of fear — especially immigrants in households. Even documented immigrants are unwilling to seek services if Mutual Assistance can’t guarantee safety, Lawrence said. She and her team have had to come up with ways to ensure their clients won’t be targeted.

Few nonprofits in the Sacramento region have been hit harder by the shutdown of AmeriCorps than Improve Your Tomorrow.

The nonprofit — which mentors more than 3,000 young men of color in Sacramento alone — lost $5 million in funding, a quarter of its annual budget, Casper said. A day after the event, Casper said he learned that IYT is now positioned to receive about a half a million dollars in AmeriCorps funding for the current fiscal year in Nevada and Maryland, but it cannot as yet get the funding for California. That includes $1.5 million blow in Sacramento.

Nationwide, IYT has several hundred college-enrolled men tutoring boys of color at the high school and junior high level and helping them find a pathway to higher education.

“Our mentors reflect the students that we serve,” Casper said, so oftentimes (they are) first-generation students, oftentimes people who are struggling to pay for college.”

When IYT mentors lost AmeriCorps, Casper said, they not only lost wages, averaging about $30,000 in Sacramento, but also loan deferments, food assistance andeducation awards that will amountto roughly $8,000 for full-time members in the fiscal year ending in September.

Losing even a portion of these benefits could result in students withdrawing from college, Casper said, so the IYT leadership team has been working to mitigate that possibility. Like Mutual Assistance, the organization secured grants based on their ability to achieve measurable results.

“We’ve been, over the last couple of months, thinking creatively on how do we make up that gap to ensure the brothers that are in need of the support, the exposure, the accountability, the love that we provide on a day-to-day basis (are) not impacted because we no longer fall in alignment with the administration’s policy,” Casper said. “We’ve got a ‘by any means necessary’ approach and mindset because we know the work is too important to become weary.”

Casper said he was encouraged by just commiserating and brainstorming with other nonprofit veterans and by seeing that charitable foundations were represented in the room and also engaged in finding solutions.

Coté, theleader of the Gender Health Center, said the losses aren’t just financial. They’re spiritual and emotional.

“Trans people have been targeted extensively with this new regime in a way that traverses the soul,” Coté said. “It’s a psychological; it’s a spiritual; it’s an emotional assault.”

Coté’s organization provides counseling, case management, and medical navigation to people who are often turned away elsewhere.

Their small staff of 11 — all trans Black, Indigenous or other people of color — deal with many of the same fears about their safety and repression of their rights as their clients. Yet every day, they work to keep up with mounting requests from people whose health insurance has lapsed or whose providers now refuse to treat them.

Coté said people ask questions such as, “Will I be able to go to a provider and receive the care that I need on my journey?” or “What does this mean for my kid? What does this mean for our schools?’‘

David Heitstuman, CEO of the Sacramento LGBT Community Center, echoed those fears. His team, too, lost a federal grant, learning it had been terminated seven days after the decision had already taken effect.

And, corporate support has plummeted by is 30%, he said.

“It’s a weird space to be in,” Heitstuman said. “We worked really hard to diversify all of our funding streams, and every single one of them — from individual donors going down to all the different state funding and local funding — is paralyzed by fear and worried.”

Meanwhile, his staff and clients face rising anxiety, despite California’s more progressive policies. His organization found in a recent survey that about 70% of respondents felt less safe being out at work or school than they did just a few years ago.

This is “in California, where we have incredible protections and a pretty affirming sort of day to day space,” Heitstuman emphasized. “To see that people are feeling like they need to go back into the closet and hide their identity just to go about their everyday life in an environment where they enjoy the most protected legal space is really, really disheartening and challenging.”

However, Heitstuman said he refuses to dilute the LGBT center’s identity just to chase safer funding.

While he and others on his team have watched allies scrub their websites of LGBTQ language and support for diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, Heitstuman said he won’t be doing that at his organization.

“We’ve been filing (IRS Form) 990s for the last 45 years,” he said.” I’ve been on thousands of TV interviews and social media posts. If they’re coming for us, if they’re going to come and round us up, they know where to find us.”

At the town hall, hosted by Sacramento Building Healthy Communities and Everyday Impact Consulting, facilitators asked attendees to offer up ideas on ways that funders could assist nonprofits in the region. The ideas will be shared with philanthropic organizations and other types of funders.

Despite the federal funding losses, the five panelists spoke with a gritty determination to adapt, seek out like-minded organizations to collaborate and keep showing up for those who depend on them.

“We have to do this together,” said Lawrence, urging government agencies and philanthropic organizations to continue to move toward a true continuum of care that provides a range of healthcare services and ensures seamless transitions between different levels of care as needs evolve.

Rios asked foundations to support more capacity-building investment so that nonprofits aren’t scrambling from crisis to crisis. Nonprofits saved the day during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said, and the partnerships with local government agencies, health care systems and foundations will be key to continuing the work in Sacramento neighborhoods as federal funding disappears.

Heitstuman said he’s “just trying to figure out ways that we can at least be in closer communication and understanding of what’s going on, sharing as much information as we have and partnering as much as we can to figure out how to continue to serve the community.”

Casper added a final plea to grantors, partners and funders, asking them to extend some grace as nonprofits find their footing amid a loss of federal investment.

While their missions have not changed, the nonprofit leaders stressed, how their services are delivered will have to change as a result of the federal funding cuts."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-just-lost-another-sales-184113096.html,2025-07-20 01:15:00,Yahoo Finance,"Tesla (TSLA) is back in focus following the abrupt departure of its highest-ranking sales and delivery executive for North America, Troy Jones. It is the latest of several high-profile executive departures that have come as the electric car pioneer struggles to overcome sluggish sales and growing investor angst.

The automanufacturer is experiencing a tumultuous 2025 as its auto sales have fallen in key markets and as CEO Elon Musk’s political involvements create reputational damage. Tesla’s delivery miss in Q2 has further raised questions about its ability to recover demand and preserve margins.

Insider Trading Alert: Here's Who Bought Nvidia and AMD Stock Before the U.S. Chip Deal with China

In the days leading up to July 23 earnings, everyone is eager to know if the company can reframe its story, or if leadership shuffles are merely the beginning of its structural issues.

Currently valued at $1 trillion, Tesla (TSLA) is a true giant in the electric vehicle and clean energy industry. However, that has not protected it from volatility.

In the last 52 weeks, TSLA has varied between $182.00 and $488.54. Shares are currently trading at the $330 level, down more than 30% from their 52-week high and down 19% in the year to date.

Tesla has a price-earnings multiple of 244.77x and price-sales multiple of 10.61x, significantly above its industry peers. Despite the very high valuation, profit margins are stretched at 7.3%, and year-over-year net earnings fell 71% last quarter. These high multiples, once justified by hypergrowth expectations, appear stretched now as sales decline and demand dips. Tesla stock, on most comparisons, is pricey based on its growth profile.

Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings missed Wall Street expectations across the board. Adjusted EPS came out as $0.27, way below the predicted $0.39, and revenue equaled $19.34 billion, lower than the forecasted $21.11 billion.

Vehicle revenue decreased 20% year-over-year to $14 billion, due to declining Model 3 and Model Y deliveries and increasing price competition. Net earnings fell to $409 million, down significantly from $1.39 billion for the same quarter last year. Operating earnings fell 66%, as operating margins fell to 2.1%, the lowest since Q1 2020.

Management attributed the miss to seasonal factory line updates for the upgraded Model Y, as well as sturdier sales incentives and weaker price power. Still, the company gave no conclusive 2025 forecast and only said that it would “revisit” estimates in its July 23 Q2 earnings report.

Tesla is pressing ahead with its Austin robotaxi pilot and is due to begin assembling humanoid robots later this year.

Tesla earns a “Hold” rating consensus. Long-term conviction in its innovation pipeline persists, but sentiment has deteriorated for the near term.

Tesla’s mean price target is $296, which is 10% down from its current trading price. Such an outlook, combined with mixed sentiment and slowing delivery growth, argues that the market is waiting for Tesla to reassert an appealing growth story before re-rating the shares.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/mexico-city-bids-adi-monument-100000855.html,2025-07-20 11:30:00,Mexico City bids adiós to monument to Castro and 'Che' Guevara,"Goodbye, Fidel.

Hasta la vista, Che.

Denunciations and accolades greeted the abrupt removal this month of a controversial monument in the Mexican capital commemorating the two revolutionaries,Fidel CastroandErnesto “Che” Guevara.

The monument, a pair of bronze, life-sized sculptures of Castro and Guevara chilling on a bench, recalls a consequential moment in both Mexican and Cuban history — the pair’s first meeting, which took place in an apartment in Mexico City in June or July 1955, according to historians.

At the time, both were twentysomething militants in the formative stages of their transformation into leftist icons who would inspire a global generation of revolutionaries and activists.

A leftist Mexico City government installed the monument in 2017 in a small park in the capital's Colonia Tabacalera neighborhood, not far from where the storied duo first met in a Cold War encounter that has taken on near-mythical dimensions among many on the left.

In the two sculptures, both men stare straight ahead and are decked out in light combat garb — Guevara in his trademark beret (a look immortalized on T-shirts across the globe) andCastrosporting a fighter's cap. His legs crossed, Castro grasps a cigar in his left hand, and a book on his right. Guevara's right hand secures a pipe.

The sculpture has long sparked polemics: While adherents of the left generally applauded it, and some visitors would leave flowers, critics assailed the artwork as a tasteless shrine to a bloody communist dictatorship.

'Ideological censorship'

César Huerta, left-wing journalist, on the statues' removal

Spearheading its removal Wednesday was Alessandra Rojo de la Vega, conservative borough president of the capital’s central Cuauhtémoc district, where the bench (known asEncuentroor Encounter) was situated.

Her decision, Rojo de la Vega initially explained on social media, was based on legality — not politics. She said there wasn't ""one single paper"" authorizing the monument's installation. Its removal, she added, would allow park denizens to stroll in ""liberty and security.""

She posted images of city workers prying out the two figures from the bench and the bronzed Castro and Guevara being ignominiously hauled away in a bulldozer.

But the borough president later pivoted to a more ideological rationale.

""This city cannot ... promote or provide refuge for figures who injured human dignity, be it in Mexico or the rest of the world"" Rojo de la Vega told Radio Formula.

As to the fate of the dual bronzes, she said that officials may consider a sale, using the proceeds — likely from lefty purchasers enthralled with the Cuban uprising — for park upkeep.

""If we auction them off, it will mark a first — the communists will usetheirmoney, not someone else's,"" Rojo de la Vega said. ""If they love them so much, they can put them in their garden, or their patio.""

Not pleased was Mexico's leftist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, who said she would speak to the Mexico City mayor — a political ally — about placing the monument elsewhere.

The question isn't whether one embraces or rejects the views of the two protagonists, Sheinbaum argued to reporters on Thursday. The Castro-Che encounter, the president said, recalled ""a historic moment"" that unfolded in Mexico and merited a display of memory.

The contretemps here echoes spats in the United States about monuments glorifying Confederate generals: Critics decry the displays as exalting traitors and white supremacists, while others argue that the statues just reflect history.

'An assassin with good press'

José Luis Trueba Lara, radio commentator, on Ernesto 'Che' Guevara

In the case of the Castro and Guevara likenesses, Sheinbaum suggested that their removal was partisan payback for her own signature monument-canceling moment — the banishment of one of Mexico's most illustrious landmarks,a virtual symbol of the city.

In her former post, as mayor of Mexico City, Sheinbaum ordered the removal of a soaring bronze of Christopher Columbus, which, for more than a century, graced a pedestal in the capital's elegant Paseo de la Reforma. The stylized tableau depicted Columbus as a noble conqueror: one hand raised to the horizon, the other lifting a veil from a globe.

For years, Indigenous activists and others staged protests at the statue, labeling Columbus and otherconquistadoresas perpetrators of genocide. In 2020, Sheinbaum finally ordered that the Columbus monument be taken down for renovations; it was never returned to its lofty perch.

Its ejection enraged both Columbus' admirers and others who viewed the monument as an integral marker of the Mexican capital. They accuse Sheinbaum of bowing to political correctness.

The traffic circle where Columbus long lent his presence has now been renamed the Women Who Fight roundabout, a rallying point for Indigenous, feminist and other protesters hoisting handwritten placards.

The grandiose Columbus figure, meantime, remains out of public sight in museum storage.

The Castro-Guevara bench, situated in an easy-to-miss park, didn't compare in size or significance to the towering Columbus of the stylish Paseo de la Reforma. But its removal lit up social media,rekindling historic enmities.

""An intent to erase the symbols of battle, of resistance, of Mexican-Cuban humanity,"" César Huerta, a left-wing journalist, wrote on X, blasting the action as ""ideological censorship.""

Read more:How 'El Diablo,' a corrupt Mexican lawman, helped create a narco-state

A radio commentator, José Luis Trueba Lara, bid good riddance, calling Guevara ""an assassin with good press"" and Castro a ""bloodcurdling dictator.""

Carlos Bravo Regidor, a columnist, berated the left for being more concerned ""about the retirement of some miserable statues of Fidel andel Chethan for the misery suffered by those who live beneath the yoke of the Cuban dictatorship.""

At the time of his 1955 encounter with Guevara, Castro, then 28, was not long out of a Cuban prison for an insurgent attack against the U.S.-backed Cuban dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista.

Guevara, nearly two years younger, was a physician from a middle-class Buenos Aires' upbringing brimming with revolutionary fervor — and a vision of a pan-Latin American socialist union,free of U.S. ""imperialism."" The two young men immediately hit if off, historians say, embarking on a lifelong friendship and collaboration in the revolutionary project.

Both would be among 82 fighters aboard the yacht Granma that, in November 1956, set sailfor Cubafrom Mexico's Gulf coast. Their voyage, and subsequent guerrilla campaign, would culminate in 1959 in a historic overthrow of Batista and the imposition of a communist government in Havana.

Fidel andel Cheare long gone, and the book on the Cold War officially closed more than a quarter-century ago. But, as the fiery debate here about an unassuming bench statue illustrates, the ideological fault lines of the Cold War are far from completely obscured, at least not in Latin America.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-why-britain-france-nuclear-190000085.html,2025-07-20 20:15:00,Opinion: Why the Britain-France nuclear accord is truly historic,"“Someone to talk to.”

That is how McGeorge Bundy, President John F. Kennedy’s national security adviser, described the Anglo-American alliance. The “special relationship,” the exceptionally close collaboration forged during the most desperate days of the Second World War, has proven remarkably durable.

By contrast, relations between France and the United States have often proven extremely difficult and challenging. This was especially the case during the Kennedy administration, when Washington’s promotion of an increasingly integrated Atlantic alliance collided directly with the extreme independent nationalism of France’s imperious President Charles de Gaulle. Contrasting, sometimes conflicting worldviews have continued to characterize our two nations.

“Brexit,” the lengthy, complex, sometimes tortured divorce of Britain from the European Union, following the surprise result of a 2016 referendum, left painful scars in that nation’s relations with the rest of Europe.

In this context, the Anglo-Frenchagreementon July 10 to develop close cooperation in nuclear weapons strategy assumes considerable importance. The accord was the capstone of the French President Emmanuel Macron’s three-day visit to Britain.

The bilateral security agreement simultaneously reflects both the direct threat of wider European war as a result of Russia’s continuing costly invasion of Ukraine, and insecurity across the board about the reliability of the United States as an ally during the unpredictable second term of President Donald Trump.

The nuclear dimension from the start of the atomic age defined in important ways U.S. relations with other nations, especially principal allies.

From the beginning of the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb, Britain and Canada were close partners of the United States. The three governments, working under great pressure, devoted unprecedented resources to create the terrifying weapon used with terrible effect to decisively end the war with Japan in August 1945.

The Truman administration made sincere, ultimately frustrated efforts to bring atomic weapons under the supervision of the United Nations. Its successor, the Eisenhower administration, did lead the complicated diplomacy that resulted in creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been generally effective in encouraging civilian use of nuclear power and restraining pressures for nuclear weapons proliferation.

In 1958, amendment of the McMahon Act updated the special partnership with Britain in the nuclear weapons sphere. Nuclear military technology was shared with the British, and the U.S. played an active role in supplying a credible nuclear deterrent to the close ally.

Dependency inevitably led to tensions. During the Kennedy administration, the abrupt cancellation of the Skybolt bomber program completely upended Britain’s force planning. Kennedy officials scrambled to provide the new Polaris nuclear-armed submarine as a substitute. The collaboration continues with today’s Trident submarine force.

Relations with France during the Second World War as well as the Cold War provide a dramatic contrast. General Charles de Gaulle, leader of Free French forces during the war, proved demanding and rigid in the extreme.

Perhaps that style was inevitable, given the humiliation of France’s stunning, devastating defeat by Germany’s military in 1940.

Both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill disliked the rigid, insecure, beleaguered French leader. Supreme Commander General Dwight Eisenhower did have good rapport with him.

When de Gaulle became President of France in 1958, he quickly emphasized a French nuclear military force to achieve desperately needed national prestige. France withdrew from NATO’s integrated military command in 1966.

Compared with this history, recent years have been relatively stable among NATO nations. In 2009, France returned to NATO’s integrated military command.

The new accord strengthens Europe’s security whatever the temperature in Washington."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/visa-holding-norfolk-based-cruise-181035616.html,2025-07-20 21:15:00,Visa-holding Norfolk-based cruise workers allegedly wrongfully deported,"NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) — “Due process is the law,” protestors chanted outside the gates of a Carnival cruise ship in Norfolk Sunday morning.

They gathered following a report that showed at least a dozen lawful, visa-holding Filipino cruise ship workers were allegedly wrongfully deported.

Aquilina Soriano Versoza, executive director of the grassroots nonprofit Pilipino Workers Center, which represents low-wage and immigrant Pilipino communities in the United States, told 10 On Your Side that more than a dozen Filipino crew members of the Carnival Sunshine cruise line, all holding valid 10-year C-1/D visas, were “forcibly removed in handcuffs” by Customs and Border Patrol officers at the Port of Norfolk.

Officers allegedly told the workers they were accused of possessing child pornography and that’s why they were removed from the ship.

Soriano Versoza said despite a lack of evidence, the cruise ship employees were all sent back to the Philippines without any legal representation or due process. Those former employees told Soriano Versoza that their employment with Carnival was terminated by the time they got home to their families.

“Their abrupt removal, accompanied by the cancellation of their visas and a shocking 10-year ban from re-entry, has inflicted deep trauma and humiliation, plunging their families into dire financial straits,” Soriano Versoza said.

10 On Your Side reached out to Carnival Cruise leaders to learn more about their former employee’s deportations.

“This is a law enforcement matter,” Carnival said in a statement. “Carnival always cooperates with law enforcement investigations. We also have active training and education programs to make sure our crew members follow internet safety guidelines.”

WAVY also reached out to Customs and Border Patrol officials Sunday in relation to claims made by PWC. Their email is monitored Monday through Friday and will likely be addressed during those days.

WAVY also reached out to Sen. Tim Kaine’s Monday morning in response of Sunday’s incident.

“The Trump Administration’s months-long strategy to detain and deport people who are here legally with work visas and do not have criminal histories hurts our economy and is a direct affront to our country’s commitment to due process,” Kaine said.

10 On Your Side also heard from Rep. Bobby Scott, who is calling for inquiries with federal authorities to learn more about why the deportations happened.

“I am making inquiries with the appropriate federal authorities to gather more information,” Scott said in a statement. “Our nation was founded on the fundamental principles of due process. Under our Constitution, everyone is entitled to due process regardless of citizenship or immigration status.

According toUSA Today, in April 2024, Tirso Neri, a citizen of the Philippines, was charged with transportation of child pornography and possession of child pornography. Neri was arrested, provided the evidence prosecutors had against him and given a court date for the alleged crimes.

The deported visa-holders told Soriano Versoza they were never shown what law enforcement cited as child pornography in their phones. They denied having any to Soriano Versoza. According to Soriano Versoza, the former cruise employees were not charged with any crimes prior to deportation.

10 On Your Side spoke with an immigration lawyer in Virginia Beach. Radlyn Mendoza, co-founder and co-owner of Gardner and Mendoza Immigration law, was born to Filipino immigrants and went to work with her parents every day in their ethnic grocery store.

“When I found out that there were some people who were protesting, I just thought to myself, ‘Wow, this is this is really bad,'” she told 10 On Your Side. “It’s bad all the way around. I’m Filipino, I’m a Filipino immigration attorney. My parents had one of the very first Filipino grocery stores in Ocean View in Norfolk.”

Mendoza highlighted the lack of due process in the deportations. She asked why the individuals were not charged if they truly committed a crime.

“Why are you not charging them if they actually did? I mean, it’s a crime to have child pornography,” Mendoza said. “So it’s very interesting to me that in several cases in Florida and I believe in California, people were charged and they were brought to justice and they did get convicted and they did serve sentences.”

When asked about the legality of the deportations, she approached it from an attorney’s standpoint and took into consideration the broad powers that secretaries of state have.

“It does fall under these really broad powers that the government has to to revoke visas, whether it’s legal or not,” Mendoza said. “As an attorney, I’m looking at the statute. Yes, we can do this. But the tarnishing of these people’s reputation? Essentially, they’re not going to be able to come back, they’re not going to be able to get another visa ever again.”

In statements to PWC, the deported individuals stuck to their claims that the alleged accusations regarding possession of child pornography are false. One 29-year-old man described being “scared” and “intimidated” after allegedly being threatened to with hefty fines and jail time to admit to a crime he claims he didn’t commit.

His statement was translated by PWC from his native language of Tagalog.

“I said no because I have sisters and I am married and have a child,” he said. “Suddenly, they threatened me and asked if I had the $250,000 to pay and if I wanted to go to jail. They tried to convince me many times to admit their accusation. I told them that I knew and God knows that I did not watch it.”

He said he willingly gave them his phone to look through and was very cooperative. He said they made him read a statement.

“And at the end, they made me read something that said that I watched minors in October 2021 and submitted a photo of minor in October 2021 as well,” he said. “I’m surprised because it’s so impossible. I’ve never watched or submitted anything like that and the evidence they’re saying is surprising because it’s just written in words and it’s not clear which platform it came from, whether it came from Facebook, Twitter, IG, et cetera.”

At one point, he said they accused him of only having a visa to “escape from the ship and work in the U.S. as an illegal.”

In his statement, the 29-year-old claimed eight other Pilipino coworkers were detained and deported.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/severe-thunderstorm-warning-3-massachusetts-210530817.html,2025-07-20 23:00:00,Update: The severe thunderstorm warning for Hampden County is forecast to expire at 6:30 p.m.,"The warning was active for Hampden County.

""The storm which prompted the warning has moved out of the area. Therefore, the warning will be allowed to expire. However gusty winds are still possible with this thunderstorm,"" according to the National Weather Service.

Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.

To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, consider the following recommendations:

Lightning safety plan:

When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.

Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby.

Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.

Indoors safety measures:

Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors.

Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges.

Wait for the all-clear:

After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.

It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.

When indoor shelter isn't available:

If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:

Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.

Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.

If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.

Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.

Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.

In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.

Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:

Beware of swollen waterways:

During heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Slow down and stay cautious:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes.

Visibility matters:

Turn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.

Watch out for slippery roads:

Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain:

Beware of rapid water flow:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Use the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.

Slow down and stay cautious:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.

Prioritize visibility

Turn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

The civilian jet dove out of its landing pattern down to roughly 500 feet off the ground to avoid the Air Force bomber, according toflight tracking dataand an announcement made by the flight’s pilot to passengers which has circulated on social media.

Air Force officials released a statement insisting the military jet was following instructions from local air traffic controllers when the incident occurred. The B-52, the Air Force said, had been approved by local air traffic controllers to make a pre-arranged fly-by of the North Dakota State Fairgrounds as the civilian flight approached the airport to land.

The incident, which occurred on the evening of Friday, July 18, happened as the civilian airplane, an Embraer E175 flying as SkyWest flight 3788,was in its approach to Minot’s airport. The airport is adjacent to the city of Minot, 13 miles south of the Air Force Base of the same name. As the plane descended toward the airport, the pilot spotted the B-52 approaching on what appeared to be a collision course. The SkyWest pilot dove the airplane away from the military jet, flying a loop before landing without further incident.

A video of the pilot’s debrief to the plane’s passengers was posted to social media, including ther/Aviation subreddit. In it the pilot calmly explains to passengers what happened and why he took a sharp turn.

“For those of you on the right‑hand side, you probably saw the airplane kind of sort of coming at us. Nobody told us about it, so we continued and there’s no radar here, so the tower does everything visually,” the pilot said.

The pilot noted the speed of the incoming plane, making it a military aircraft, and said the best thing to do to avoid a collision was to make a turn. He apologized for the incident.

“I don’t know why they didn’t give us a heads up,” the pilot continued. “Because the airport base does have radar, and nobody said ‘hey, there’s also a B‑52 in the pattern.’”

Minot Air Force Base is home to the 5th Bomb Wing, which operates 26 B-52 Stratofortresses. An Air Force spokesperson said in a statement that the service is looking into the matter.

“We can confirm that a B-52 aircraft assigned to Minot AFB conducted a flyover of the North Dakota State Fair Friday evening,” the statement said.

In a statement posted on July 22, Minot Air Force Base said that a B-52 doing a flyover at the North Dakota State Fairgrounds. Over the course of 40 minutes the bomber crew was in contact with Minot Approach and the Minot International Airport’s air traffic control tower. At 7:43 p.m., the Air Force said, the B-52 crew was told to contact the civilian airport.

“The B-52 crew contacted Minot International Airport tower and the tower provided instructions to continue 2 miles westbound after the flyover,” the Air Force said. “The tower did not advise of the inbound commercial aircraft.”

The Federal Aviation Administration told Task & Purpose it is investigating the incident.

SkyWest, which operated the regional connector flight for Delta Air Lines, said that the incident is under investigation.

“SkyWest flight 3788, operating as Delta Connection from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Minot, North Dakota on July 18, landed safely in Minot after being cleared for approach by the tower but performed a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path,” SkyWest’s statement said.

The close call at Minot is the latest aviation near miss this year. In March, a Delta flight leaving Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C.came closeto an inbound Air Force T-38. Air traffic controllers were able to instruct the pilots of the aircraft on new headings in order to avoid a collision. That incident came only two months after a fatal collision over the Potomac River near the same airport. In January, an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicoptercollidedwith an American Airlines plane, killing all three soldiers on the helicopter and the 64 people on the plane.

Update: 7/22/2025;This story was updated with a new statement from Minot Air Force Base on July 22."

Brett Hankison, who fired 10 shots during the raid but didn’t hit anyone, was the only officer on the scene charged in the Black woman’s death. He is the first person sentenced to prison in the case that rocked the city of Louisville and spawned weeks of street protests over police brutality five years ago.

U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings sentenced Hankison at a hearing Monday afternoon in which she said no prison time “is not appropriate” for Hankison. She also said she was “startled” that there weren’t more people injured in the raid.

She sentenced him to 33 months in prison as well as three years of supervised probation. Hankison will not report directly to prison. Jennings said the Bureau of Prisons will determine where and when he starts his sentence.

Jennings expressed disappointment with federal prosecutors’ sentencing memo filed last week, saying the Justice Department treated Hankison’s actions as “an inconsequential crime,” and said the memo was “incongruous and inappropriate.”

Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who helped Taylor’s family secure a $12 million wrongful death settlement against the city of Louisville and was present Monday, had called the Justice Department recommendation “an insult to the life of Breonna Taylor and a blatant betrayal of the jury’s decision.”

After the sentence, Crump yelled to the crowd outside the courthouse, “Say Her name.” The crowd yelled back: “Breonna Taylor!”

Hankison fired his weapon the night of the March 2020 botched drug raid, his shot flying through the walls of Taylor’s apartment into a neighboring apartment without hitting or injuring anyone.

The 26-year-old’s death, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked racial injustice protests nationwide that year.

Last week, the U.S. Justice Department recommended no prison time for Hankison, in an abrupt about-face by federal prosecutors that has angered critics after the department spent years prosecuting the former detective.

The Justice Department, which has changed leadership under President Donald Trump since Hankison’s conviction, said in a sentencing memo last week that “there is no need for a prison sentence to protect the public” from Hankison. Federal prosecutors suggested time already served, which amounts to one day, and three years of supervised probation.

Prosecutors at his previous federal trials aggressively pursued a conviction against Hankison, 49, arguing that he blindly fired 10 shots into Taylor’s windows without identifying a target. Taylor was shot in her hallway by two other officers after her boyfriend fired from inside the apartment, striking an officer in the leg. Neither of the other officers was charged in state or federal court after prosecutors deemed they were justified in returning fire into the apartment. Louisville police used a drug warrant to enter the apartment, but found no drugs or cash inside.

A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison in 2023, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.

In their recent sentencing memo, federal prosecutors wrote that though Hankison’s “response in these fraught circumstances was unreasonable given the benefit of hindsight, that unreasonable response did not kill or wound Breonna Taylor, her boyfriend, her neighbors, defendant’s fellow officers, or anyone else.”

On Monday, the Louisville Metro Police Department arrested four people in front of the courthouse who it said were “creating confrontation, kicking vehicles, or otherwise creating an unsafe environment.” Authorities didn’t list the charges those arrested would face.

“We understand this case caused pain and damaged trust between our department and the community,” a police statement said. “We particularly respect and value the 1st Amendment. However, what we saw today in front of the courthouse in the street was not safe, acceptable or legal.”"

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-fcc-chairman-gloats-over-205056693.html,2025-07-22 21:15:00,Trump’s FCC chairman gloats over Colbert’s cancellation days after meeting soon-to-be CBS owner,"Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission, gloated Tuesday morning over the abrupt cancellation ofStephen Colbert’slate-night CBS show and gleefully mocked critics of the move.

“The partisan left’s ritualist wailing and gnashing of teeth over Colbert is quite revealing,” Carrtweeted. “They’re acting like they’re losing a loyal DNC spokesperson that was entitled to an exemption from the laws of economics.”

Carr’s post came the morning afterColbert fired backat Donald Trump forcelebratingthat the comedian “got fired,” telling the president to “go f*** yourself” during a blistering monologue that also saw the host promise that “the gloves would be off” over his final 10 months on air.

On top of that, Carr’s mockery of Colbert and his defenders comes just days after the FCC chairmanmet with David Ellison, the CEO of Skydance Media and the son of pro-Trump billionaire Larry Ellison. According to a regulatory filing, Ellison urged Carr to finalize Skydance’s $8.4 billion merger with Paramount, the parent company of CBS that recently settled a “meritless” lawsuit with Trump over a60 Minutesinterview with Kamala Harris.

The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Carr’s tweet.

The meeting between Carr, Ellison and Ellison’s legal team took place two days before CBS announced that it was canceling Colbert’s show, which Paramount executives claimed was purely a “financial decision” due to the program’s hefty production costs and thedwindling ad revenues for late-night programmingon linear television.

Asking Carr to “promptly grant” Paramount’s request to transfer control of its broadcast licenses to Skydance while highlighting “the public interest benefits” of the merger, Ellison’s team promised the FCC that CBS would be “unbiased” under the new corporate leadership.

“[W]e explained the Ellison family and RedBird represent fresh leadership with the vision and experience needed to drive New Paramount’s long-term growth in the face of the challenges presented by today’s media landscape, all while preserving and enhancing the legacy and broad reach of both the national CBS television network and the company’s 28 owned-and-operated local television stations,” Ellison’s attorney wrote in the filing.

“Relatedly, we discussed Skydance's commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS's editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers,” the lawyer added.

While it has been recently reported that Colbert’s showwas losing as muchas $40 million annually despite being the top-rated show in its time slot, prompting Colbert himself tocall out his own network Monday nightfor leaking the data to justify the cancellation, CBS has been accused of appeasing the Trump administration with the “politically motivated” move. Especially since Colbert not only has long been critical of Trump, but has also repeatedly blasted Paramount’s decision to settle its lawsuit, likening it to bribery in order to grease the wheels of the merger.

The Writers Guild of America, which represents the writing staff ofThe Late Show, said it is concerned that the cancellation “is a bribe, sacrificing free speech to curry favor with the Trump Administration as the company looks for merger approval.”

CBS staffersalso aren’t buyingthe company’s claims that Colbert’s show was canceled due to financial reasons. “Many of us think this was part and parcel of the Trump shakedown settlement,” one network employee toldThe Independent.

Meanwhile, several Democratic lawmakers who are already alleging the network is placating Trump with the cancellationhave also pressed Ellisonabout the president’s claim that they reached a side deal on the lawsuit settlement. Trump has asserted that, besides the $16 million Paramount agreed to pay, Ellison promised as much as $19 million in pro-Trump advertisements on CBS once the merger is complete.

During Colbert’s broadcast on Monday night,several other late-night show hosts and celebritiesappeared to show support for the CBS star, includingThe Daily Show’sJon Stewart, who is also rumored to possibly face cancellation amid the merger.

In hisown passionate and profane monologueon Monday night, Stewart defended his longtime friend while acknowledging that he could soon be on the chopping block himself. At the same time, he called out Paramount for being fearful of Trump and his anti-media crusade.

“And if you believe as corporations or as networks, you can make yourselves so innocuous that you can serve a gruel so flavourless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar,” Stewart proclaimed. “Why will anyone watch you? And – you are f***ing wrong.”

Carr, who serves as Trump’s own personal“attack dog”against the legacy media, has long been a fierce critic of the mainstream press and hasopenedorthreatenedseveralinvestigationsinto media companies over their news coverage.

Earlier this spring, Carr said“all options remain on the table”in his agency's ongoing “news distortion” probe of CBS News over the60 Minutesinterview behind the president’s lawsuit. Months later, Paramount would reach its settlement with the president.

Meanwhile, Carr’s tweet prompted centrist pundit Matthew Yglesiasto notethat the FCC chief “should clear the air” over whetherThe Late Show’scancellation is playing a factor in his decision to approve the Paramount-Skydance deal.

“I think the fact that it’s been widely reported in the business press that Paramount believes settling lawsuits with Trump is key to winning merger approval from your agency is influencing some people’s understanding of the Colbert situation,” Yglesias wrote, leading Carr toreactwith awind blowing faceemoji."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/passenger-describes-moment-flight-turned-141711628.html,2025-07-22 21:15:00,Passenger describes moment flight turned to avoid B-52 bomber,"A passenger who was aboard the SkyWest flight that turned toavoid a B-52 bomberon Friday said it felt like going around a ""sharp turn on a roller coaster.""

""The force of it kept me centered in my seat, but I could look out the window and see straight at the grass instead of seeing the horizon,"" said Monica Green, who recorded video of the pilot making an announcement about the incident after landing in Minot, North Dakota.

""Just out of the blue, just sort of very abrupt U-turn,"" she said.

The SkyWest flight had 76 passengers and four crew members on board at the time. B-52 bombers typically carry a crew of five, and the military aircraft was streaking low over Minot on its way to a flyover at the North Dakota State Fair.

""The flyover was planned in advance and approved by the Federal Aviation Administration,"" Minot Air Force Base said on Monday.

The base said it communicated the flyover plans to Minot Approach Control and that the B-52 crew ""communicated the flyover plan to both RAPCON and Minot International Airport's air traffic control tower.""

""The B-52 crew contacted Minot International Airport tower and the tower provided instructions to continue 2 miles westbound after the flyover,"" the base said. ""The tower did not advise of the inbound commercial aircraft.""

In the video that Green recorded after the plane landed safely, the pilot calmly tells passengers: ""For those of you on the right-hand side, you probably saw the airplane kinda sorta coming at us. Nobody told us about it and so we continued.""

""I don't know how fast they were going but they were a lot faster than us,"" he said, in part. ""I thought the safest thing to do was to turn behind it. So, sorry about the aggressive maneuver. It caught me by surprise.""

""This is not normal at all,"" he added.

Green said the pilot had told passengers while they were still in the air that he would inform them about what was going on once they landed safely.

""It was so crazy to not know what was happening in the moment and just hear it after the fact, and then just be let off the plane just to continue about our days as normal,"" Green said.

The FAA is investigating and working to determine how close the planes were.

Green said the pilot did an amazing job and wants to thank him for making sure everyone was safe.

She also said she wants answers. The flight stuck with her during her trip home to Dallas on Monday.

""I was sweating,"" she said. ""I was shaking. I was not excited to get on and it really hit me once we started taking off.""

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/8-best-european-national-parks-080000246.html,2025-07-23 09:30:00,8 of the best European national parks to discover this summer,"This article was produced byNational Geographic Traveller(UK).

Europe’s national parks contain a magnificent array of landscapes; think glaciers, volcanoes, primeval forests, mountain ranges and wild Atlantic coasts. In many cases, summer is the best time to visit them. Here we’ve picked out eight that show off the continent’s diversity as well as its beauty.

These parks are concentrated either in the Alps or in the far north and west, which means you may not get uninterrupted sunshine while you’re there, but you will find the temperatures invigorating rather than stifling. These are big, raw and intricate places, and the best way to understand them is to get active and embrace your spirit of adventure.

Mother Nature was at her most adventurous when she shaped mainland France’s second-largest national park, the Massif des Ecrins, and its surrounding mountains. You can see the evidence on the approach road from Grenoble, where pyramid peaks shoot straight up from the valley floor and the strata lurch up and down through the cliffs like a contorted layer cake. Topping out at 13,458ft, the massif is slightly lower than Mont Blanc further north, but also more abrupt and dramatic, making for a gob-smacking backdrop to any holiday, whether you’re wild-camping (one-night bivouacs are permitted under certain conditions) or staying in one of the villages in the park’s extensive buffer zone. Several, including Les Deux Alpes, Monetier-les-Bains and Orcieres Merlettes, are off-duty ski resorts, which means they're brimming with inexpensive self-catering apartments as well as mountain lifts, bike trails, swimming pools and tennis courts. But you’ll find much smaller and cuter alternatives as you burrow into the valleys, including Vanosc on the Vénéon river and La Chapelle-en-Valgaudémar on banks of the Séveraisse.

The Dolomites are very popular right now — skiers flock to their spectacular slopes each winter, five-star spa hotels buzz with guests looking to relax and recharge, and the outstanding food and wine has made the region a gastronomic mountain hub to rival Savoie in France. Unsurprisingly, resort towns such as Cortina, Corvara, Selve and Canazei have all become rather busy as a result, so it’s good to know that a little further south (and closer to Venice airport), the Dolomiti Bellunesi National Park preserves a more pristine section of this remarkable mountain range. As ever, the Dolomites’ distinctive geology has created a stunning backdrop of rocky towers, cliffs and spires, but what lies beneath them is just as interesting. Vibrant beech forests, rare flowers, herds of red deer and chamois, wolves, bears and golden eagles — it’s a rich mix, and the best way to get a sense of it all is to hike up to one of the mountain huts, such as the Rifugio Bianchet above the forested Val Vescovà.

It’s a mesmerising thing — the endless heave and suck of the tides along the Pembrokeshire coast in southwest Wales. In spring and early summer, vast colonies of nesting seabirds swarm the islands of Skomer and Skokholm. From late August, grey seals haul themselves up onto inaccessible beaches to pup, while crabs, sea snails and wading birds eke out a living between the tides throughout the year. There are all sorts of ways to explore this frontier, from rock-pooling to sea kayaking, but one of the most adventurous is to go coasteering. Led by qualified guides and protected by wetsuits, life jackets and helmets, participants work their way along the waterline, beneath cliffs, onto skerries and across secret coves in an adventure that’s, by turns, euphoric and scary. As with all the finest Pembrokeshire activities, it’s best booked in advance — as is accommodation, especially in crowd-pleasing spots such as Solva, Fishguard and St Davids.

Established in southwestern Ireland in 2024, Páirc Náisiúnta na Mara, Ciarraí (as it’s officially known) will challenge many people’s views of what a national park should be. Mostly, it protects marine environments such as the Kerry Head Shoal (an important breeding ground for sharks, rays and skate). All of its constituent elements, both on land and at sea, are fragments rather than a contiguous whole — but what magnificent fragments they are. Top of the must-see list is Skellig Michael. A pyramid of slate and sandstone, it rises 714ft out of the Atlantic, eight miles from the Kerry coast, and it’s crowned by the remains of an early-medieval monastery, whose cells and oratory were built like beehives well over 1,000 years ago. Boat trips link the island with the mainland between mid-May and the end of September, and there are sailings to the Blasket Islands, too, which are also part of the park. Kerry is the nearest airport but bear in mind this is a popular coastline in summer, so best to book a car and accommodation well ahead of time.

For a blood-curdling sense of nature’s power, go to Vatnajökull National Park. Covering 5,779sq miles of southeastern Iceland, it’s Europe’s largest national park outside Russia and protects a mind-blowing mix of volcanic, glacial and flood-sculpted landscapes that are in a permanent state of flux. Much of it is off limits, buried beneath a blanket of ice that’s still, in places, 3,000ft deep, but in summer, between late June and late August, it will easily repay a whole week of exploration. Hire a 4WD vehicle so you can tackle some of the dirt tracks and river crossings that lie beyond the metalled main roads. Among the must-sees are the thunderous Dettifoss waterfall and the Laki volcanic fissure. When the latter erupted in 1783, 120 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide was spat out into the atmosphere. Book your accommodation well in advance, especially in the more remote areas in the east.

Lofoten marches into the sea west of Narvik like a stegosaurus’s back — a chain of improbably steep and magnificent islands that draws a million visitors every year. Created in 2019, the Lofotodden National Park is designed to relieve some of the pressure by protecting one of the most spectacular parts of the landscape on the west coast of Moskenesøya. Here, near the archipelago’s end, you’ll find some of its most intricate coastlines, where fjords reach deep inside the island and almost every scrap of land seems to be a crag or a cliff. That said, it’s also home to some gorgeous beaches — and wild camping is the best way to experience it, provided you’re prepared to hike over demanding terrain, and leave no trace of your visit behind. You should also be equipped to deal with the vagaries of the North Atlantic climate, which is just as likely to douse you in rain as bathe you in sunshine. If that all sounds a bit arduous, rest assured there is some lovely guest house and cabin accommodation available in the fishing villages that dot the eastern shoreline, although a healthy budget is needed to book them.

Slovenia’s only national park isn’t one of Europe’s behemoths, but it is nonetheless a beauty. Centred on 9,396ft Mount Triglav, north west of Ljubljana, it contains a raw and distinctive range of limestone mountains known as the Julian Alps, as well as the forested and little-developed valleys in between. For many, hiking to the summit of Triglav is the goal. Some of the routes up the peak aren’t technical; the final section, however, is dangerously exposed and protected by a via ferrata. If you don’t know how to use one, hire a guide. But there are all sorts of more accessible ways to enjoy the park: for example, swimming in the crystal-clear waters of Lake Bohinj, wandering the alpine pastures of the Pokluka Plateau or rafting in the Soča Valley. The off-duty ski town of Kranjska Gora, just north of the park, has plenty of accommodation and makes a good base for trying out a variety of mountain sports. But for a proper sense of alpine serenity, consider the little village of Ukanc, tucked away at the western end of Lake Bohinj.

Straddling the Arctic Circle in eastern Finland less than an hour’s drive north of Kuusamo Airport, Oulanka covers 104sq miles of primeval forest, swampy peatlands and raging rivers, and in summer it teems with life. Bears, lynx, moose, wolves, capercaillie, rare orchids — they’re all here in an intact forest ecosystem that, until the second half of August, also teems with mosquitos, so come prepared. Despite the remote location, it’s a popular hiking destination. Not only is it home to Finland’s favourite multi-day hiking trail, the 50-mile Karhunkierro, it’s also well supplied withcamping areas and wilderness huts. But if you don’t feel confident tackling such an unfamiliar landscape, you can always join a guided hike from adventure companies such asOulangan Taika, which also offers guided canoeing and packrafting trips, as well as equipment rental.

Inan interviewwith right-wing broadcaster Benny Johnson on Monday, Lara Trump — who is married to Trump’s son Eric — said the President wanted to “set things right” and would release more documents sooner rather than later.

“There's no great plot to keep this information away that I'm aware of. I just believe that maybe it's been slow-rolled, for reasons that hopefully we understand down the line,” the Fox News host and former Republican Party official told Johnson.

Her answer contradictedthe Trump administration’s announcement last week there is actually no “Epstein client list”and that no further disclosures are “appropriate or warranted”, as well asTrump’s own pleading with his supporters to drop the subject.

That came after many months of Trump officials and outriders trumpeting the imminent release of bombshell secret Epstein documents,including the convicted sex offender financier’s supposed “client list”.

The abrupt about-facesparked fury among Trump’s fan base, who had been primed to expect the unraveling of a vast child abuse conspiracy centered on Trump’s political opponents.

“Look, I don’t know what truly exists there, but I know this is something that’s important to the president as well,” Lara Trump said in her interview with Johnson.

“He does want transparency on all these fronts, everything we’re talking about. Because it’s frustrated him as well. He sat for four years like the rest of us did and saw lie after lie and our country just being sent down the wrong path...

“I know this is probably not his number one thing he’s focused on... but he hears all the noise, and he hears all the consternation out there, and I think he’s gonna want to set things right as well.

“So I believe that there will probably be more coming on this, and I believe anything that they are able to release — that doesn’t damage any witnesses or anyone underage, or anything like that — I believe they’ll probably try to get out sooner rather than later.”

Trump’s own statements have set a very different tone, suggesting that the so-called “Epstein files” were merely a hoax concocted by his enemies in order to persecute him.

“We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and ‘selfish people” are trying to hurt it — all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,” he said on his social network Truth Social on Saturday.

“For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again... let’s not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”

At a press conference last week, he also admonished a reporter who asked him about Epstein, saying: ""This guy's been talked about for years... we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things. And are people are still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.""

Epstein’s own abuse of minors has been extensively documented, and his “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell was criminally convicted for her role in trafficking girls for him. Allegations he also provided victims to rich and powerful “clients” have never been definitively proven.

Thousands of pages of documents have already been made public, including Epstein’s address book. The term ‘Epstein list’ often simply means a list of all the people mentioned in these documents,which includes victims and bystanders as well as alleged associates.

But in recent years, Trump and his allies have embraced the idea that there is another “list” the government is covering up: a client list containing the names of everyone who abused girls trafficked by Epstein.

That was red meat for the ardently conspiracist MAGA movement and theprofessional fantasists who sustain it, many of whom see Epstein as merely the tip of an iceberg involving more fanciful theories such asQAnon.

On Sunday the official account of Sesame Street muppetElmo even weighed in, having been temporarily taken over by an unknown hacker.

""RELEASE THE FILES @realDonaldTrump CHILD F*****,"" wrote the hacker, in between calls for genocide against Jews."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rfk-jr-policies-making-covid-100000873.html,2025-07-23 11:30:00,RFK Jr.’s Policies Are Inflaming the Threat of Covid,"Leigh Haldeman, a nurse at a hospital in Seattle who is 32 weeks pregnant with her second child, was advised in early June by her medical team to get vaccinated for Covid. This was not idle medical advice: She’d had complications in her first pregnancy that made her high risk if she were to get Covid. Her midwife advised her to get the vaccine while she was still pregnant, to avoid getting Covid in her third trimester and toprotect her newborn.

What should have been a straightforward vaccination turned into a Kafkaesque runaround—one that portends the chaos to come for people trying to get Covid vaccines now and come the fall. The result will be lower rates of Covid vaccination and higher rates of transmission, long Covid, hospitalizations, and deaths with asummer surgealready underway.

In late May, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hadtaken to Xto announce that Covid vaccinationswould no longer be recommendedto pregnant people or healthy children, althoughlong Covid is now the most common chronic condition among children.* A week before, the Food and Drug Administration had alsoannouncedthat healthy people under age 65 would not be eligible for the shot.

The announcement raised a flurry of questions and panic within the public health community: Notwithstanding the fact that this abrupt announcement occurred on social media rather than any official channel, it preempted the late June meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, a team of experts who have handled annual vaccination recommendations for the past half-century. It also, of course, went against thehundredsof studies on the Covid vaccine’ssafety and efficacy.Recent data on last winter’s Covid shotshowed 30–40 percent additional protection against urgent care visits and 40–70 percent additional protection against hospitalizations and ICU stays, with protection lasting six months or more.

The directive was also contradictory, marking an unprecedented divergence in the guidance from public health experts at the CDC and competing information coming down from RFK Jr. and the FDA. TheCDC clearly lists pregnancyas an underlying qualifying condition for a Covid vaccine, anddid not removeits recommendation for vaccination in children from its vaccine schedule.

This all left Haldeman in a tough position. At work at the hospital, she and her colleagues in infectious disease medicine had no idea if she would be allowed to get the vaccine, although they all agreed she should. Haldeman previously had no issues getting vaccinated or boosted for Covid-19, and received a booster during her first pregnancy.

She made an appointment and went to the closest Walgreens. The staff there immediately noticed she was pregnant and told her they couldn’t administer the vaccine—they could only give it to her if she was immunocompromised, and they did not consider pregnancy to fall under that category. “It was very frustrating,” she said.

When asked for comment, a Walgreens spokesperson said that “Walgreens is proud to continue serving our patients as a trusted and convenient resource for immunizations” and will “continue to closely monitor and review all federal and state guidance related to vaccines.” The spokesperson clarified that the policy varies, state by state.

After being turned away, Haldeman called her primary care doctor to see if they could give her the vaccine, but they told her they didn’t have it in stock. The midwifery clinic didn’t either. No one had good advice to offer, other than calling around pharmacies until someone would do it.

So she called a nearby Safeway pharmacy. The person on the phone first said no, but when she objected, she was transferred to a pharmacist. The pharmacist said maybe she could get the vaccine if she got a prescription from her provider and brought that with her to the pharmacy, but didn’t guarantee it would work.

Armed with a prescription, she went to the nearest Safeway, only to discover that it didn’t have the vaccine in stock. At the second-closest Safeway, staff noticed she was pregnant and panicked, and had her sit in a waiting room. “I was in tears at this point, just so frustrated,” she said. “I wasted so much time.”

Haldeman eventually succeeded in getting her vaccination on her fourth attempt, but the experience left her unnerved and upset. “I had to advocate for myself so much to actually get the vaccine,” she said, recognizing that most people, especially those who are hesitant about vaccines in the first place, would likely give up. Moreover, the experience made her feel criminalized: “If someone’s treating you like you’re doing something illegal, then you’re going to assume that there’s something wrong with what you’re doing, even though the evidence is clearly very much in support of getting vaccinated while pregnant,” she said.

A company spokesperson toldThe New Republicthat Safeway is “committed to providing care that aligns with the latest public health recommendations … in accordance with CDC guidance.… Currently, individuals, including those pregnant, with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness remain eligible for vaccination.” Still, Haldeman had to get a prescription from a doctor to obtain the vaccine.

Haldeman’s experience makes clear that medical professionals, pharmacies, and people trying to get vaccinated are all weathering the fallout of RFK Jr.’s announcement restricting Covid-19 vaccines and the muddle that followed, and trying to figure out how to proceed amid the confusion.

“Secretary Kennedy’s decision is already causing substantial uncertainty and access issues,” said Doris Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and expert in legal issues around vaccines.

Just days before the ACIP committee was set to meet, RFK Jr.abruptly firedall 17 of its members—all of whom were preeminent vaccine experts—andappointed eight new ones. Of the new appointments, most were prominent vaccine skeptics, many of whom had clearconflicts of interest. Amid the egregious diversions from established procedures, it has gone virtually unnoticed that the new slate of ACIP members didn’t even meet avoting quorum.

The meeting went ahead, despiteobjections, and the committee ended up postponing the vote on Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant people and children.

“I am not sorry that this group—several of which have clear anti-Covid-19 vaccine biases—did not vote on the issue,” said Reiss. “Apart fromDr. [Cody] Meissner, committee members lack subject matter expertise and several have clear anti-vaccine biases.”

The American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP,boycottedthe meeting—“We won’t lend out our name to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children’s health,” said the AAP president in avideoposted before the event.

The Evidence Collective, a group of public health experts and communicators, logged50 falsehoodsstated during the two-day meeting. “The members didn’t seem to understand basic vaccine studies,” said Jonathan Howard, a neurologist in New York and author of the bookWe Want Them Infected.

Though the committee did vote to approve RSV shots and (most) flu shots, the new ACIP chair, Covid and vaccine skeptic Martin Kulldorff, a statistician and epidemiologist, announced two new working groups that would reassess children’s vaccines schedule recommendations.

Both Reiss and Howard commended the CDC staffers for presenting information in an informative and accessible way, despite the significant challenges they faced.

Reiss said that the vote for Covid vaccines could be held in October, when the next quarterly ACIP meeting is scheduled, or sooner at a separately scheduled meeting. Until then, as Dr. Angela Branche, an infectious disease expert at the University of Rochester Medicine,told Rewire, “we are basically operating blind.”

In early July, the American Association of Pediatrics—along with several doctors, including a pregnant plaintiff doctor who also had trouble getting the vaccine—sued HHS, arguing RFK Jr.’s directive and firing of the ACIP members was “arbitrary and capricious” and has caused significant harm to doctors looking to stock and administer the vaccine.

Reiss added that having a plaintiff with standing, or one like the pregnant doctor, “Jane Doe,” who has clearly been directly impacted by the directive, strengthens the lawsuit. (Reiss is not affiliated with the lawsuit.)

“Pregnancy increases the risk of severe illness and complications from infectious disease, including preterm birth and stillbirth,” thelawsuit text states. “However, the Directive creates barriers to access to the vaccine and has left Jane and her husband overwhelmed with stress and uncertainty. Her worries are not just for herself, but also for the health and safety of her unborn child.”

The strongly worded lawsuit underscores the importance of ACIP not only in establishing vaccine recommendations but also in determining insurance coverage, state and local laws, and vaccination requirements in schools and medical settings.

RFK Jr.’s directive restricting vaccine access via X “breaks the promise that the Secretary made to the Senate and the American people not to make it difficult to get vaccines or discourage them,” the text states. “The Directive, unless vacated, will result in preventable deaths, including the unborn and newborns under six months old.”

It continues: “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”

Reiss thinksit’s highly possible to proveRFK Jr.’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious.” As she explained toThe New Republic, “In both the video and the directive, Secretary Kennedy provided very little explanation, let alone a thorough consideration of the existing evidence and a justification for deviating from past agency positions.”

In response to the lawsuit, the so-called “MAHA Institute” sent anunconvincing rebuttal to its subscribers.

Until a judge halts RFK Jr.’s directive, it will stand. Meanwhile, 80 medical associations reaffirmed their commitment to vaccination, while the University of Minnesota–based Vaccine Integrity Project isworking with a number of partnersto offer its own vaccine recommendations regardless of what the now-compromised ACIP decides.

The antidemocratic, anti-science actions at HHS go beyond RFK Jr., who has appointed like-minded henchmen like Jay Bhattacharya to head the National Institutes of Health and Dr. Vinay Prasad at the helm of the influential Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research arm of the Food and Drug Administration, or CBER.

Prasad, who I havewritten about in these pages, is overseeing a “consolidation of power” at CBER. He hasrepeatedly overruledFDA experts’ recommendations for Covid vaccines. He is behind the decree that they be restricted to people over 65 and those age 12 to 64 with underlying health conditions, according to Biospace, a life science news site. A July 9 memo by Prasad,riddled with egregious inaccuracies, argued that he felt “differently about certain aspects” of the FDA reviewer’s conclusions that Covid vaccines should remain broadly available.

“I think there has got to be a ton of frustration at the FDA with Prasad overruling them all based on vibes,” said Howard.

This alarming growth of authoritarianism at HHS is just the beginning. Although thevast majority of Americans,including Republicans, believe vaccines are safe, there will be considerable fallout from giving anti-vaxxers a mainstream platform of authority. In addition to confusion and mistrust, such sentiments have already led to ameasles outbreak, which RFK Jr. is grossly mishandling, and the looming threat of bird flu.

The consequences of these policies will be more transmission of preventable diseases and death, in a time when accessing health care is about to become more difficult, with thelargest Medicaid cuts in historyimminent.

Amid the horrors, it’s easy to forget that Covid-19 remains a threat. “We’ve all sort of gotten numb to it,” said Haldeman. But without tools available to fight it, we’re walking straight into another public health disaster: “It’s really dangerous.”

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-epstein-saga-trump-against-140000746.html,2025-07-23 17:00:00,"Opinion - In the Epstein saga, it’s Trump against America","On the long list of Republicans’ recent disgraces, Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) decision toshut down the House until Septemberrather than allow a vote to release Jeffrey Epstein’s files may be at the very top. Apparently the people who urged Americans to “do your own research” on vaccines really don’t want you thumbing through information on Epstein.

Johnson’s spineless play is one more MAGA middle finger to a public that just wants Congress to keep its word. What makes this retreat truly shameful is the fact that Republicans aren’t doing any of this for some lofty moral purpose. Their stop-work order doesn’t represent the desires of MAGA voters, a majority of whomwant the Epstein files released. It doesn’t prevent a bad law from passing or draw attention to an injustice being committed on the House floor.

Rather, Johnson and his Republican colleagues have decided that whatever is in the Epstein files is worse for them than the hell they’re currently catching from voters. That says a lot, because President Trump’s handling of the Epstein scandal is absolutely toxic with almost every group in America.

Only40 percent of Republicansapprove of Trump’s handling of the files, while some of the president’s top MAGA influencers now openly wonderwhy he’s working so hardto protect information about one of the country’s most notorious pedophiles.

At just38 percent approval, Trump is approaching a level of unpopularity he hasn’t felt since early 2017, as voters struggle to make sense of his abrupt about-face. Republican lawmakers aren’t having much luck figuring out Trump’s motives, either. They’ve given up even trying to defend his bizarre claim that Epstein’s crimes were ahoax financed by Democrats. Instead, they’ve turned off the lights on Capitol Hill and sprinted away.

Voters are right to be suspicious.

“We should get real answers on what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. All of that should be open to the public, it should be absolutely transparent,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.told Fox Newsin 2023. But Kennedy, who madeseveral tripson Epstein’s private jet, now refuses to answer questions.

In 2021, future Vice President JD Vance implied that anyone fighting to keep Epstein’s files secretcould be a potential client. “What possible interest would the US government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret?” he added. It’s a great question that still demands an answer.

Last week, the White House introduced its latest effort to delegitimize whatever horrors are hidden in the pages it still refuses to reveal. In an Oval Office press conference, Trump authorized Attorney General Pam Bondi to release “whatever is credible” from files he claimed a day before didn’t exist at all. By floating the idea that some of Epstein’s files could be fake, Trump is setting the stage to invalidateany references to him in the documents— if those specific pages areeven allowed to see the light of day.

What must be going through Johnson’s head as he directs House Republicans to sinkbill after billordering the release of Epstein’s files? Johnson has long made his Christian faith a centerpiece of his public identity, to the point of questioning whether religion shouldeven be separate from government. Yet his desire to lead Congress with Christian morality was no match for Trump, who seemingly co-opted Johnson into his cover-up scheme without a whisper of resistance from the Speaker.

Johnson’s decision to walk off the job and away from the business of the American people is jarring even by the low standards of the Trump era. After whining for an entire campaign season that Democrats weren’t working hard enough, Johnson’s Republicans havepassed fewer lawsand worked less than any Congress in decades. Cornered by Epstein drama of their own making, Johnson’s Republicans are no longer even pretending to do their jobs.

Congressional Republicans no longer serve the American people at large, or even their own conservative constituents. They serve — or in the case of Johnson’s early recess, don’t serve — in whatever way best protects Trump’s personal and political interests. If that means hiding Epstein’s heinous crimes from public accountability and denying closure to his many victims, so be it.

Johnson’s decision to shutter the House in order to protect Trump reveals a Congress in an advanced state of decay and a Republican Party willing to rationalize any evil in the name of protecting its strongman. What other horrors will Mike Johnson bury in order to keep his morally bankrupt party afloat?

Credit: PJM Interconnection

Gov. Josh Shapiro joined a bipartisan group of leaders in nine states who called for more input on electricity grid operator PJM Interconnection’s governance. The move came as PJM announced a hike in energy costs for the second year in a row.

Clean energy experts said the surging prices for electricity to meet the 13-state PJM region’s peak demands is a clear signal for generators to build new capacity, especially renewable sources such as wind and solar farms.

PJM, however, has been slow to grant approvals. Facing an onslaught of new energy projects seeking permission to connect to the grid, it closed its queue to new applications in 2022.

“When prices go up, it’s meant to send a signal to energy developers: ‘We need more supply.’ But at the same time PJM is holding up a big red STOP sign to energy developers,” Jon Gordon, policy director at Advanced Energy United, said in a statement.

And as demand for electricity increases with the increased electrification of transportation and industry, combined with the proliferation of power-hungry data centers driven by advances in artificial intelligence, consumers feel the pinch.

“With the queue closed, new energy projects in the region can’t get in line to connect to the transmission grid, meaning households and businesses are paying for a price signal that the market can’t even respond to,” Gordon said.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

The elimination of tax credits for renewable energy sources in the budget reconciliation act President Donald Trump signed earlier this month and his executive order to end federal agencies’ preference for wind and solar power would make it more difficult to respond to the supply crunch, said Sharon Pillar, executive director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center, which works to extend the benefits of solar power across the state.

That leaves the grid more dependent on large power stations.

“Solar power, batteries, and energy efficiency measures have been proven to help reduce this peak energy usage, keeping prices down for all consumers by reducing the amount of expensive (and dirty) power needed from these generators,” Pillar said, noting the technology was vital to preventing blackouts on New England’s grid during a recent heatwave.

As demand has increased, PJM said, existing power plants have been retired as a result of federal and state policies to decrease the use of fossil fuels. It has approved 46,000 megawatts of new generating capacity. But, the project’s owners have been slow to move forward due to factors including the availability of equipment, financing challenges and state and local permitting, PJM said in astatement.

Shapiro and Republican and Democratic governors from nine statessent a letter to the PJM Board of Governorslast week saying the inability of the organization to efficiently connect new generating capacity and conduct long-term planning has cost the region thousands of jobs and billions in new investment that have gone elsewhere.

“It is long past the time for real grid reforms that allow our region to compete at the speed of business and build a system that delivers affordable, reliable power for the people and businesses PJM serves,”Shapiro saidin a statement last Thursday. “I am hopeful that this historic collaboration between the PJM states will provide the opportunity to foster a stronger, collaborative partnership between PJM and the 67 million people it serves to chart a strong energy future together.”

The letter said PJM’s deficiencies threaten the reliability and affordability of the electricity supply consumers need.

“We are deeply concerned that PJM’s response has been typified by halting, inconsistent steps and rising internal conflicts within the stakeholder community,” it reads, noting the “abrupt termination” of two board members and the imminent departure of PJM CEO Manu Asthana.

Asthana, who has led the organization for five years,announced in Aprilthat he would resign to return with his family to their home in Texas. Two board members were not reelected at the body’s meeting in May.

The governors’ letter called on thePJM managersto take action to restore confidence in the organization by appointing “distinguished, widely respected individuals” to the open board seats. The letter requested a meeting with the board’s nominating committee to discuss a proposed slate of candidates.

The letter said representatives of the governors, who include Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, would attend the board’s meeting Wednesday and be available to discuss the proposal.

PJM Board Chair David Mills said in a response to the letter that he would reserve time during the meeting for the representatives to share the governors’ perspectives with the entire board.

A spokesperson for Shapiro declined to comment on the meeting Wednesday.

One Pennsylvania state lawmaker has also called for reforms to improve PJM’s transparency and accountability. While the board of managers is independent of the generators and electric companies that are members of PJM, the member companies vote privately in committees on which policies the board will consider.

Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) has proposed legislation that would require members to report their votes to the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. The bill is awaiting action in the House Energy Committee.

“Upper-level votes are sometimes public, but with lower-level votes being held in secret, the damage is often done before a policy is elevated to the upper-level,” Rabb said in a memo seeking co-sponsors. “Simply put, these companies shouldn’t be allowed to vote in secret when our health and the future of our world depends on it.”

PJM, based in King of Prussia, operates the electrical grid that connects power stations to local electric companies from Illinois to New Jersey and from Pennsylvania to North Carolina. It’s responsible for ensuring that there’s enough electricity available when demand peaks on the hottest and coldest days of the year.

As a result of PJM’s annual wholesale capacity auction, announced Tuesday evening, electricity producers will receive $329.17 per megawatt-day to provide capacity when the peak demand hits in 2026 and 2027. That’s the maximum rate approved by federal regulators. A megawatt-day is roughly enough electricity to power up to 900 homes for a day.

That’s a 22% increase over the price set in last summer’s auction, which drove double digit increases in consumer electricity costs that started last month. PJM noted the wholesale price of electricity accounts for a relatively small share of consumers’ electricity bills and this year’s price would likely result in a 1.5% to 5% increase.

The Shapiro administration sued PJM after last year’s capacity auction and reached asettlement in January,later approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in which  PJM agreed to reduce the maximum bid that generators could offer.

In a statement Tuesday, the administration cast the results of the auction as a $8.3 billion decrease in costs for electricity customers across the PJM region. In Pennsylvania, 13 million electricity consumers will save an average of $116 in the next year, the governor’s office said.

State  Public Utilities Commission Chairman Stephen DeFrank said the hike in the wholesale cost would have been closer to 36% without the settlement.

“Between the last two capacity auctions, ratepayers in Pennsylvania and across PJM are paying billions of dollars with minimal new generation on the horizon,” DeFrank said, adding, “The only real, long-term solution to tight market conditions is the addition of new supply from all types of generating resources.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/u-ends-support-cmb-s4-170000646.html,2025-07-24 00:45:00,U.S. Ends Support for CMB-S4 Project to Study Cosmic Inflation,"Amid simmering anxiety about thefuture of federally funded science, the U.S. government has quietly withdrawn support for cosmology’s next premier project, an experiment that would have given us the best read yet of the strangest chapter in our cosmic origin story.

CalledCMB-S4—or Cosmic Microwave Background Stage 4—the project would have used a suite of new radio telescopes, constructed in Antarctica and Chile, to search the big bang’s faint, ancient afterglow for new clues aboutthe universe’s earliest moments. First conceived in 2013 and repeatedly ranked as a top priority by the nation’s astronomers and physicists, the project carried an estimated $900-million price tag, which was set to be roughly split between U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Yet in a terse, unsigned statement to project leaders on July 10, the two agencies declared they had “jointly decided that they can no longer support the CMB-S4 project.”

[Sign up for Today in Science, a free daily newsletter]

“We knew things weren’t looking good,” saysJohn Carlstromof the University of Chicago, the project’s principal investigator. “They had warned us that it was not the time to start any big projects, given all the budget areas and all the uncertainty. But whether they would continue to drag us out or have a clean break or try to do something—that was unknown.”

Without federal support, Carlstrom says, the project is essentially canceled. Although abrupt, the decision follows years of concern about the decay of U.S. Antarctic scientific infrastructure, exacerbated by hesitations from both agencies about starting big new projects in the face ofongoing federal budget uncertainty.

Still, the decision “is a tremendous loss for science and also for the U.S. as the leader in science. It’s a big blow to the community,” saysHitoshi Murayama, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and chair of the once-a-decade Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel, whichin 2023 ranked CMB-S4as the highest priority for construction. The project also receiveda high ranking in 2021from the U.S. astronomy and astrophysics community via a similar but separate process, theDecadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020).

“If the agencies are really saying it’s over, scientifically, that’s awful,” saysJoel Parriott, the American Astronomical Society’s director of external affairs and public policy. “And for the people involved, that’s devastating.”

The universe burst into existence some 13.8 billion years ago, and the unfolding sweep of cosmic evolution eventually led to us.

“What kind of universe created intelligent beings that can go and look at the first instants and understand how everything evolved?” Carlstrom says.

Perhaps the most curious aspect of that beginning is the wealth of circumstantial evidence suggesting that in the first minuscule moments after the big bang, the universe underwent an almost inconceivably exponential expansion—a ballooning so violent it shook the fabric of the newborn cosmos. This “cosmic inflation” would have left indelible ripples in spacetime called primordial gravitational waves. Today they would be visible as subtle, swirly fingerprints in the big bang’s relict radiation. Known as the cosmic microwave background, or CMB, that radiation is a diffuse light that permeates all of space. CMB-S4’s flagship objective was to detect those signature swirls in the CMB and clinch the case for cosmic inflation.

“There are a few different signatures that would be consistent with inflation, and some of them we’ve already seen,” saysJo Dunkley, an astrophysicist at Princeton University. “But the tensor fluctuation—these gravitational waves—they would be much stronger evidence than we currently have.”

First observed in 1965, the CMB has become a treasure trove for cosmologists, who use it to look back in time and study the characteristics of the very early universe. But even after 60 years of observations, we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible to see in this faint light.With CMB-S4and other next-generation observatories, scientists have aimed for multiple breakthroughs, ranging from precisely measuring the energies at play in the first instants of creation to constrainingthe properties of dark energy, the still-mysterious force that drives the universe’s accelerating expansion. Along the way, almost as a bonus, advanced CMB studies could also revealnew particles, clarify the nature of known ones (such as neutrinos) and identifythe earliest seedsof sprawling galaxy clusters and other large-scale cosmic structures.

A key signal of cosmic inflation would be patterns of swirling ripples imprinted on the cosmic microwave background by primordial gravitational waves. The swirls seen here, however, in data from the BICEP2 telescope, ultimately proved to be contamination from dust in our own galaxy.

“The CMB is a way that we might learn about physics at scales that are completely inaccessible in any other way,” saysDavid Spergel, a theoretical astrophysicist and president of the Simons Foundation.

To definitively detect—or rule out—those inflation-scrawled swirls, scientists need to make very deep and detailed observations of the CMB. That’s something best done from space, above Earth’s turbulent, troublesome atmosphere, following in the footsteps of a few earlier CMB-focused satellites from NASA and the European Space Agency. Today such a mission would cost billions of dollars, however, and wouldn’t be amenable to upgrades or enduring operations. Seeking the swirls is feasible (and cheaper) from Earth—presuming you’re able to stare for a long time at the same patch of sky through an exceptionally stable and dry column of air.

Antarctica, despite its logistical challenges, is one of the very few places on the planet where that’s possible. “The South Pole is particularly outstanding in that regard,” saysRachel Mandelbaum, a physicist at Carnegie Mellon University, who served on multiple high-profile expert panels that recommended prioritizing CMB-S4. “If you’re at the pole, as the Earth is rotating, you’re still looking at the same patch of sky.”

That would make the U.S.’s Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station a natural hosting site for CMB-S4. And in fact, it is already home to a couple of other CMB projects: theSouth Pole Telescopeand the BICEP Array. (Incidentally, the BICEP Array predecessor BICEP2 made its own claim of detecting smoking-gun swirls in the CMBin 2014, although thoseputative featureswere soon shown to instead be the work ofcontaminating dust in our own Milky Way.)

At the South Pole, with anew five-meter aperture microwave telescopeplus an array of nine smaller telescopes and state-of-the-art detectors, CMB-S4 would take an ultradeep look at roughly 3 percent of the sky. It would be much more sensitive than all of its predecessors and more easily able to cut through any contaminating dust.

To add to CMB-S4’s utility and allure, the project also planned to include two new six-meter telescopes on the summit of Cerro Toco in Chile’s Atacama Desert. High, dry and with a stable atmosphere above, that site is already hometo the Simons Observatory, a newly operational set of telescopes that are conductingsimilar cosmological observations. The additional CMB-S4 telescopes would make nightly observations of huge swaths of galaxy-studded sky in an effort to map visible matter, better understand the dark universe and catch astrophysical transient events in action.

Altogether, there would have been 550,000 detectors spread between CMB-S4’s two sites, giving the project an unprecedented chance to hunt for clues of cosmic inflation in the universe’s oldest light.

“I’m kind of mesmerized by how much science there still is to get from the CMB,” saysSuzanne Staggs, a physicist at Princeton University and co-director of the Simons Observatory. “It provides a unique opportunity to understand the early universe.”

With such a compelling science case—and such strong support from multiple authoritative panels planning the near future of U.S. research—CMB-S4 seemed almost inevitable for a time. “This project has scientifically been through about every appraisal that it could be, with glowing reviews,” Parriott says.

Optimistically, the team hoped it might be able to start construction at the two sites in the near future. Then delays started piling up, and a series of rude awakenings began.

Despite its status as a scientific priority, CMB-S4’s not-so-glowing fate may have been foretold years ago. Chief among its challenges was that prized South Pole location because, while the pole might be ideal for astronomy, it’s not the easiest place on Earth to build and operate sophisticated science facilities. Antarctica is the coldest, driest, windiest, most remote continent on Earth; it demolishes infrastructure without even trying.

And NSF, which manages the U.S. Antarctic program on behalf of the government, has known for more than a decade that the existing facilities are in desperate need of maintenance. “If someone hasn’t been following this for a while, they might assume that this is the government pulling back from all kinds of projects,” saysMitch Ambrose, director of science policy news at the American Institute of Physics. “But in the case of CMB-S4, I think there’s a longer history in terms of the challenges with the infrastructure in Antarctica that have been brewing.”

In 2011 the White House and NSFconvened a panelto evaluate the logistical challenges associated with maintaining U.S. scientific leadership in Antarctica. Thepanel’s report, released after visits to three Antarctic research stations, noted that activities there “are very well managed but suffer from an aging infrastructure” and are hamstrung by “the lack of a capital budget,” which it described as “a situation that no successful corporation would ever permit to persist.”

“The status quo is simply not an option,” the report continued, after noting such deficiencies as a warehouse where forklifts fall through the floor, buildings with gaps so large that snow blows inside and the repeated forced choice between repairing a roof or conducting a science experiment.

A report from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences followed andalso identifiedthe need to shore up crucial Antarctic infrastructure. NSF, correspondingly and with a limited budget, began planning some upgrades. Then 2020 and the COVID pandemic came along, with disruptions to site access and supply chain issues that sent price tags through those crumbling roofs.

“A lot of that planning really went off the rails during the pandemic in a major way,” Parriott says. “As somebody who’s spent a lot of time thinking about the U.S. Antarctic program, it’s kind of heartbreaking to see what’s become of it.”

Since then NSF has struggled to make the required upgrades—a situation that became an ominous portent for projects like CMB-S4.In 2023the agency paused new projects at the South Pole.In May 2024NSF definitively told CMB-S4 that the South Pole was off-limits; buildings were sinking into the snow, electrical power was insufficient, and there wasn’t enough room to house essential personnel. As a result, NSF officially declined to move the project toward its next design milestone.

“When the announcement came out a year ago, I was completely shocked,” Staggs says.

Afterward NSF and the DOE had a simple question for CMB-S4: Could the project proceed without the South Pole site? What if Chile was the only option?

On June 4 the collaboration submitteda proposalto both agencies that outlined a path forward in Chile at roughly half the cost of the original plan. By constructing one large telescope plus a smaller array of dishes at Cerro Toco and leaning heavily on data-sharing and collaborations with the South Pole Telescope, the Simons Observatory and others, the CMB-S4 collaboration reckoned it could still achieve its scientific objectives, albeit more slowly and less robustly.

“In the June plan, the idea was: ‘Okay, we’re scaling back; we’re working with these other experiments so that allows us to build less.’ And the expectation was that we could get telescopes on the air as early as 2032 ... with combined results in 2040, 2041,” Carlstrom says. “You know, when I started this [in 2013], I thought, ‘This is going to be great; we’ll get on the air in 2020, and I can retire in 2025.”

Staggs, the Simons Observatory’s co-director, says both projects’ leaders met multiple times over the past year to talk about the revised plan.

“Even prior to that, because there was always a plan for part of the CMB-S4 to be in Chile, we had envisioned that eventually the two projects would be working very closely together, at least operationally, but with no details laid out yet,” Staggs says. “And we were sort of hoping we would be starting on that right around now—because, with the news that they would need to move to Chile, it seemed it was going to be a good opportunity for us to work together more.”

But under intense and mounting budgetary pressures, a balance sheet filled with fixed costs for operating cherished existing facilities and a backlog of other projects awaiting construction, the agencies decided to withdraw anyway.

The agencies “just had really hard choices to make,” Ambrose says. “This is the biggest tension point here: the community seems to really want this thing, and yet the agencies aren’t willing to do it.”

Knocked down hard, scientists who had planned on CMB-S4’s success are now focused on getting back up—and charting a new path forward.

“It’s not that the search for primordial gravitational waves won’t happen; it just won’t advance as rapidly as we had hoped,” Spergel says. “I hope this ends up being an opportunity to rethink how we do the science and not a decision to step away from doing what is really exciting and compelling science.”

In a statement sent toScientific American,a DOE spokesperson reiterated that “the scientific case for CMB exploration is strong and compelling” and said that the agency “plans to continue supporting CMB research,” which is described as a core component of the DOE’s high-energy physics program. That includes investigating opportunities to make near-term upgrades to existing experiments at the South Pole and in Chile. (NSF declined to provide comment.)

“If these existing projects weren’t there at all, that would be also a different situation,” Dunkley says. “We’ll have to see how things evolve on that front: How much upgrading or continuation of the projects that are already running can be achieved?”

One possible solution, Spergel says, is to build as much as possible in Chile to do as much science as possible from there—and then pivot to the South Pole if needed.

Another possibility that most U.S. researchers seem less eager to mention is to effectively cede leadership in CMB studies to other nations. Japan’s space agency, for instance, is leading development ofLiteBIRD(Light Satellite for the Study of B-mode Polarization and Inflation from Cosmic Background Radiation Detection), a space-based CMB mission, for launch in the early 2030s. And on the Tibetan Plateau, China’s Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) hasrecently completedthe first of two planned construction phases, with scientific observations soon to begin. The U.S. is involved in both efforts, chiefly viahardware contributionsfrom the federal National Institute of Standards and Technology, but onlyplays a supporting role. Despite continued U.S. support for CMB experiments in Chile, perhaps the long-sought confirmation of the strangest chapter of cosmic history will come from elsewhere.

“We’ll get there eventually,” Carlstrom says. “It’s just going to be much harder to do without the South Pole, much harder to do without substantial new instrumentation wherever you are, including Chile.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/state-department-oks-322-million-014811022.html,2025-07-24 02:30:00,State Department OKs $322 million in proposed weapons sales to Ukraine,"The State Department said Wednesday that it has approved $322 million in proposed weapons sales to Ukraine to enhance its air defense capabilities and provide armored combat vehicles, coming as the country works to fend off escalating Russian attacks.

The potential sales, which the department said were notified to Congress, include $150 million for the supply, maintenance, repair and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles, and $172 million for surface-to-air missile systems.

The approvals come weeks after Defense SecretaryPete Hegseth directed a pause on other weapons shipments to Ukraineto allow the Pentagon to assess its weapons stockpiles, in a move thatcaught the White House by surprise. President Donald Trump then made an abrupt change in posture, pledging publicly earlier this month tocontinue to send weapons to Ukraine.

“We have to,” Trump said. “They have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard now. We’re going to send some more weapons — defensive weapons primarily.”

US resumes sending some weapons to Ukraine after Pentagon pause

Trump recently endorsed a plan to have European allies buy U.S. military equipment that can then be transferred to Ukraine. It was not immediately clear how the latest proposed sales related to that arrangement.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has provided more than $67 billion in weapons and security assistance to Kyiv.

Since Trump came back into office, his administration has gone back and forth about providing more military aid to Ukraine, with political pressure to stop U.S. funding of foreign wars coming from the isolationists inside the Trump administration and on Capitol Hill.

Over the course of the war, the U.S. has routinely pressed for allies to provide air defense systems to Ukraine. But many are reluctant to give up the high-tech systems, particularly countries in Eastern Europe that also feel threatened by Russia."

“I urge immediate action to ensure her safety,” said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), one of three Republicans on the committee who voted to subpoena the Justice Department for files related to the Epstein investigation, in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Maxwell is scheduled to sit for a deposition on August 11 at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida.

In recent weeks, Republicans have turned on President Donald Trump after the Justice Department walked back the release of files related to the Epstein case, including a supposed “client list” the department now denies exists.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) sent lawmakers home early to avoid a vote forcing the administration to release the documents.

Perry, meanwhile, called Maxwell’s testimony on her relationship with the disgraced financier “invaluable” to Congress.

“As such, I request that she be placed immediately into Protective Custody within a Special Housing Unit, and continuously monitored immediately,” Perry said. “Given the abrupt and unexpected demise of lead suspect, Mr. Epstein in 2029 while in federal custody, we must take every precaution to ensure Ms. Maxwell is available to provide testimony.”

Perry added, “Our justice system must not once again fail the countless survivors of Mr. Epstein.”

Scott Perry is calling for “immediate action” by prison officials to ensure the safety of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell ahead of her possible testimony to Congress.

The Pennsylvania congressman posted a letter about the associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to Federal Bureau of Prisons Director William Marshall on Wednesday.

“I implore you to take swift and immediate action in protecting Ms. Maxwell,” Perry wrote in the letter, dated July 22.

“I implore you to take swift and immediate action in protecting Ms. Maxwell.

“Given the atmosphere of a minimum-security prison, Ms. Maxwell must be isolated from fellow inmates, protected by facility guards, and be closely surveilled by guards and working video surveillance - continuously - for signs of distress until she has testified before Congress.”

Maxwell’s lawyer, David Oscar Markus, did not immediately respond to an inquiry from the Daily Beast. The Federal Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on Perry’s letter. The Daily Beast also reached out to the White House for comment.

Maxwell, 63, was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking and conspiracy to recruit underage girls to travel for illegal sex acts. She has been serving a 20-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida—a low security women’s prison.

Perry’s request comes as the House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to Maxwell for deposition scheduled August 11, and as Donald Trump’s Justice Department is aiming to interview her.

“The Department of Justice is cooperating and will help facilitate the deposition at the prison,” Rep. James Comer wrote when announcing that he had issued the subpoena.

The president’srelationship withEpstein has long beenunder the microscope, but especially so after the FBI and Justice Department announced earlier this month that they would not be releasing any more of the so-called Epstein files. That decision fractured Trump’s base, whom the president has sought to distractby feeding themconspiracies andculture war issues.

The specific nature of Perry’s letter—stressing the need for “working video surveillance,” for instance—appears to reference Epstein’s August 2019 death in his jail cell following his arrest for child sex trafficking. The death was ruled a suicide, but faulty security cameras and non-punctual guards spawned alternative theories.

Given Epstein’s “abrupt and unexpected demise,” Perry wrote, “we must take every precaution to ensure Ms. Maxwell is available to provide testimony.”

“Our justice system must not once again fail the countless survivors of Mr. Epstein,” he added."

In the 30-minute episode — titled “Sermon on the ‘Mount,” which likely has Paramount and Skydance Media banging their heads against a wall — Stone and Parker jab at Trump’s obsession with using lawsuits to silence media and political opponents, ChatGPT, the injection of religion into America’s public schools, government censorship, and corporations caving to pressure. (“Who the hell does the president think he is?” Eric Cartman says upon learning NPR was canceled. “The government can’t cancel a show. I mean, what show are they going to cancel next?”)

In one scene, the president is depicted laying naked in bed with a poorly endowed penis trying to seduce Satan, as the series regular tells Trump, “I can’t even see anything, it’s so small.”

The tumultuous premiere concludes with a PSA alluding to reports that Paramount will be giving the Trump Administration PSAs as part of their agreement and features an AI-generated Trump who is fully nude and wandering the desert with a “teeny tiny” penis.

Prior to the release of the season debut, theSouth Parkco-creatorsthankedParamount co-CEO and president of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Chris McCarthy and COO Keyes Hill-Edgar for years of partnership.

“We are grateful for this opportunity and deeply honored by the trust placed in us.

Area,"The Trump administration plans to push thousands of U.S. Agriculture Department workers out of the Washington, D.C., region by forcing them to relocate to far-away offices if they want to keep their jobs.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollinsannouncedthe plan in a press release Thursday, with her office claiming the move would “better align” the agency “with its founding mission of supporting American farming, ranching, and forestry.”

Rollins said the department employs around 4,600 workers in the D.C. area, but by the time the transition is over, it plans to have “no more than 2,000” left in and around the nation’s capital. It also expects to close most of its buildings in the area, including a majorresearch center.

The D.C.-area employees would be transferred to “hub” locations in Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Collins, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah, the agency said.

Rollins acknowledged the move would create “personal disruption for you and your families,” in avideodirected at agency employees.

“This decision was not entered into lightly,” she said.

Everett Kelley, president of theAmerican Federation of Government Employees, a union representing USDA workers, told HuffPost in a statement that the move would damage the agency. He noted that, despite common misperceptions,85% of federal employeesalready live outside the Washington, D.C., region.

“But D.C. is the center of our nation’s government for a reason, as it facilitates needed coordination between senior leadership and field offices and ensures agencies are at the seat of the table when decisions are made at the White House and in Congress,” Kelley said.

He singled out the announced closure of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland as particularly misguided, calling it a “crown jewel” for critical research.

“I’m concerned this reorganization is just the latest attempt to eliminate USDA workers and minimize their critical work,” Kelley added.

The relocation proposal is reminiscent of a similar, controversial plan at the USDA from the first Trump presidency.

In 2019, then-Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdueannouncedthat two agencies within the USDA would be relocated to Kansas City to save money and place employees in the Heartland. The move crushed morale and prompted many workers to leave rather than upend their families’ lives; it also fueled asuccessful union organizing campaignamong USDA staff.

Mick Mulvaney, who had served as Trump’s budget director, laterboastedabout how many resignations the plan had spurred.

HuffPostreportedearlier this year on how that move was still dogging the agency and its mission more than five years later. A USDA economist said the relocation plan appeared to be little more than a mass layoff in disguise.

“We had a lot of people who had spent their careers working on very specific fields — very niche questions,” the economist said. “And when they left, it was so sudden and abrupt that there wasn’t time to bring in the next generation. You had to just leave all of your work and go.”

Rollins argued that pushing workers to other states would benefit the agency’s work.

“President Trump was elected to make real change in Washington, and we are doing just that by moving our key services outside the beltway and into great American cities across the country,” she said.

The proposal aligns with Trump’s broader attacks on the federal workforce.

Since taking power in January, the administration has gone to great lengths to push federal employees out of the government, either by firing them through legally dubious means, enticing them to leave through early retirement offers or making them so miserable that they decide to quit.

More than 15,000 USDA employees took the administration’s “deferred resignation” proposal earlier this year, raising concerns about how it would continue to enforce food safety, administer agricultural programs and conduct critical research. In fact, so many chose to leave that USDA leadership had toencourage some to change their minds.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/timeline-trump-team-epstein-files-194815624.html,2025-07-24 21:00:00,Timeline suggests Trump team changed its tune on Epstein files after Trump was told he was in them,"The news Wednesday that Attorney General Pam Bondi told President Donald Trump back in May thathis name appeared in the Jeffrey Epstein filesisn’tthatsurprising, in context.

We’ve known the two men hada relationship dating back decades, and we’ve seen Trump’s nameappear in various previously released Epstein-related materials. Being in the documents isn’t proof of any wrongdoing.

But the news is significant in another way: It adds to questions about precisely why the administration changed its tune on the Epstein files.

That doesn’t mean there’s been a cover-up of any actual Epstein-related misconduct by Trump; there remainsno real evidence of that. But the administration clearly started downplaying the Epstein information – in a rather abrupt shift – around the same time Trump was told his name appeared in the files.

What’s more, sources familiar with the review told CNN the files appeared to include several unsubstantiated claims about Trump and others that the Justice Department found not to be credible.

In other words, extensive disclosures could have at least created problems for Trump. And the administration appeared to abruptly move away from such disclosures.

We’ll get to the full timeline in a second. But a few key things stand out:

While we don’t know the precise date in May that Bondi briefed Trump, the efforts to downplay Epstein conspiracy theories and previous promises for disclosure really kicked off onMay 18,when top FBI officials Kash Patel and Dan Bongino appeared together on Fox News and suddenly said Epstein had indeed died by suicide.

News of that May briefing contradicts Trump’s claim from July 15 that Bondi hadn’t told him he was in the files. When asked, Trump told reporters: “No, no, she’s given us just a very quick briefing.” If this is a nothingburger, why hide that?

Elon Musk’s later-deleted claimthat Trump wasn’t releasing the Epstein files because he was in themwas lodged June 5, after the May briefing.

Trump’s recently launched,baseless claims that powerful Democrats“made up” the Epstein files would fit with his tendency to deflect and distract when there’s something he doesn’t want out there.

Prior to May, the administration had repeatedly promised extensive disclosures. Bondi in early March said Americans would “get the full Epstein files,” subject to some redactions, and that “everything’s going to come out to the public.” Trump said on April 22 that “100% of all of these documents are being delivered.” But by late May and early June, Patel and Bongino for the first time indicated there wasn’t much to the information and walked back those promises. On May 29, Bongino suggested itamounted to “nothing.”On June 4, he downplayed the case as a “hot potato for folks.” On June 6, Patel went further than the administration had before in suggesting disclosures would be limited to avoid re-victimizing people, saying, “Not doing it. You want to hate me for it, fine.” The administration ultimately did not release substantial new documents, saying in its July 7 memo that it “found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials” and citing how many of them were under court seal.

The administration did hype the files in one big way in early May. Bondi said on May 7 that the information included “tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn.” By June 6, Patel appeared towalk back Bondi’s claim. The DOJ’s memo a month laterdid not back it up.

And now, the full timeline.

Feb. 21: Attorney General Pam Bondi is asked by Fox News about an Epstein “client list,” and she responds by saying that it’s “sitting on my desk right now to review.” (The administration has since claimed she was referring to other documents.)

Feb. 26: Bondi on Foxhypesa release of documents set for the following day, calling it “breaking news,” and saying it will include “a lot of information.”

Feb. 27: The White House invites right-wing social media influencers to the White House and gives them binders of Epstein-related documents. But the documents are mostly old news, andsome influencers cry foul.

March 1: Bondi tells Fox that Americans will “get the full Epstein files,” subject to redactions to “protect grand jury information and confidential witnesses.”

March 3: Bondi tells Fox’s Sean Hannity that DOJ has received a new “truckload of evidence” from the FBI. She adds that “everything’s going to come out to the public.”

March 14: Bondi repeats on Fox Business Network that she has received a new “truckload of documents.” She adds that “we will get out as much as we can, as fast as we can, to the American people, because they deserve to know.”

March 23: Bondi tells Fox News that “we are releasing all of these documents as soon as we can get them redacted to protect the victims …”

April 22: President Donald Trump is asked in the Oval Office about when the Epstein files will be released and says, “100% of all of these documents are being delivered.”

May 7: Bondi claims there are “tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn.” Her public claim comes shortly before therelease of a secretly recorded videoin which she made a similar claim.

Sometime in May: Bondi briefs Trump about the Epstein files and tells himhis name appears in them, among several other high-profile figures, CNN has confirmed. The files appeared to include several unsubstantiated claims, including about Trump, that the DOJ found to be not credible, sources said. (The precise date of this briefing isn’t clear, but White House officials noted Wednesday that Trump’s name was already in the binders Bondi handed out earlier this year.)

May 18: For the first time, the administration begins downplaying the Epstein conspiracy theories. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino appear together on Fox News andsay Epstein indeed died by suicide. This despite both of them havingpromoted the conspiracy theoriesbefore joining the FBI.

May 19: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says the administration is “committed to releasing those files,” but defers to the Justice Department on timing.

May 29: Bongino on Fox again downplays the significance of what will soon be released. “There is nothing in the file at this point on the Epstein case,” he says. “And there’s going to be a disclosure on this coming shortly.” He says the administration will release video of the jail on the day of Epstein’s death that backs up that assertion.

June 4: Bongino is pressed on Hannity’s show about the lack of Epstein disclosures. He downplays the case as a “hot potato for folks” and then alludes to his own evolution on the subject: “I’m not paid for my opinions anymore. I work for the taxpayer now. I’m paid on evidence. That’s it.”

June 5: Elon Musk claims while lashing out at Trump that the “real reason” the president is not releasing the Epstein files isbecause “@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.”He provides no evidence for his claims and later deletes the post, while expressing regret for some of the things he said about Trump.

June 6: Patel appears on Joe Rogan’s podcast anddownplays the looming disclosures again. “We’re gonna give you everything we can,” Patel says, before adding that “we’re not gonna re-victimize women. We’re not going to put that sh*t back out there. It’s not happening, because then he wins. Not doing it. You want to hate me for it, fine.”

Patel also appears to contradict Bondi’s claim about “tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn,” telling Rogan the videos from Epstein’s island are “not of what you want.”

July 6: Axios breaks the news that the DOJ hasofficially concluded that Epstein died by suicide and there was no “client list,”despite Bondi’s comments in February.

July 7: The DOJ releases anunsigned memolaying out these conclusions. DOJ says it won’t release any further documents because much of it is under court-ordered seal. “Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials and will not permit the release of child pornography,” the memo says.

The memo alsoundercuts Bondi’s claimsof “tens of thousands of videos” of Epstein “with children or child porn.”

July 8: Trump for the first timelashes out at people still asking questions about Epstein, calling those questions a “desecration.” He tells reporters: “Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy’s been talked about for years.” He cites recent deadly floods in Texas and adds: “I mean, I can’t believe you’re asking a question on Epstein at a time like this.” The president will go on to make similar comments over the next two weeks, including baselessly suggesting various powerful Democrats are behind the Epstein files.

July 15: Trump is asked about whether Bondi told him his name was in the files and denies it. “No, no, she’s given us just a very quick briefing and – in terms of the credibility of the different things that they’ve seen,” he says.

July 23: We learnTrump is indeed in the files.

The Justice Department argued a federal judge in Massachusetts was wrong to block the National Institutes of Health from making $783 million worth of cuts to align with President Donald Trump’s priorities.

U.S. District Judge William Young found that the abrupt cancellations ignored long-held government rules and standards.

Young, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, also said the cuts amounted to “racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community.”

“I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this,” Young said at a hearing last month. An appeals court left the ruling in place.

The ruling came in lawsuits filed by 16 attorneys general, public-health advocacy groups and some affected scientists. His decision addressed only a fraction of the hundreds of NIH research projects that have been cut.

The Trump administration’s appeal also takes aim at nearly two dozen cases over funding.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer pointed toa 5-4 decisionon the Supreme Court’s emergency docket from April that allowed cuts to teacher training programs to go forward, one ofmultiple recent victoriesfor the president at the nation's highest court. The order shows that district judges shouldn’t be hearing those cases at all, but rather sending them to federal claims court, he argued.

“Those decisions reflect quintessential policy judgments on hotly contested issues that should not be subject to judicial second-guessing. It is hardly irrational for agencies to recognize—as members of this Court have done—that paeans to 'diversity' often conceal invidious racial discrimination,” he wrote.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/without-naming-trump-elena-kagan-222533227.html,2025-07-24 23:45:00,"Judges’ orders ‘need to be respected,’ Elena Kagan says amid Trump’s escalating conflict with the courts","MONTEREY, California — As the Trump administration’sclash with the judiciary intensifies, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan issued a message on Thursday: Stop threatening judges, and always obey court orders.

But Kagan spoke in vague terms and did not say who her warning was aimed at. She did not directly mention President Donald Trump, even assome lower-court judgeshavealready foundthat the administration hasdefied their commands.

“That's just just not the way our system works, not the way rule of law in this country works,” Kagan said at a judicial conference here. “That's true for the Supreme Court, and it's also true for every district court. Unless and until an appellate court or the Supreme Court says otherwise, judicial orders are judicial orders and need to be respected.”

Kagan cautioned the hundreds of judges in the audience not to respond to verbal attacks by lashing out in their decisions, but by carrying out their duties as they normally do.

“The response to perceived lawlessness of any kind is law, and the way an independent judiciary should counter assaults on an independent judiciary is to act in the sorts of ways that judges are required to act,” Kagan said.

The Obama appointee praised Chief Justice John Roberts forpushing back against attacks on the courtsfrom both the right and the left. And she said the notion that “government officials” could or should ignore court orders was particularly disruptive to the rule of law.

Though Kagan spoke only in general terms, the backdrop for her remarks was unmistakable. Several federal district judges have found that the Trump administration has violated their orders, particularly in deportation cases. Trump officials — and the president himself — have launched hostile rhetoric against judges who rule against the administration. And a whistleblower has accused a top Justice Department official ofcrudely proposingto defy adverse court orders.

Just hours before Kagan spoke, another speaker on the same stage denounced statements in February from Trump and Vice President JD Vance that seemed to invite a confrontation with the courts.

“He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” Trump said at the time.

“Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,"" Vance said.

Kagan is the latest member of the court’s liberal wing to decry threats to judicial independence. In May,Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson urged judicial colleagues to show “raw courage”in the face of a fusillade of attacks that she said appeared designed to intimidate the judiciary. And In March,Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an abrupt shift in normswas “shaking some of the foundation of the rule of law.”

Kagan’s tone was less urgent than Jackson’s, though she raised many of the same concerns, including an increasing number of threats of violence aimed at judges.

Kagan lamented the protests that erupted outside the homes of conservative justices’ homes followingPOLITICO’s 2022 report on the draft Supreme Court opinionoverturning the federal constitutional right to abortion. She mentioned that some of her colleagues have children and that Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home was targeted by an unsuccessful assassin during the same period.

“That is scary stuff,” Kagan said.

Kagan’s most significant criticism of the court she serves on was directed at its handling of cases on the emergency docket, sometimes referred to as the shadow docket by critics. That docket has received a flood of appeals from the Trump administration in the first six months of Trump’s second term. Trump has won the vast majority of them, as the Supreme Court has overturned district court orders and allowed the administration to mass-fire federal employees, cancel federal grants, exclude transgender people from the military and enact other sweeping parts of Trump’s agenda.

Kagan spoke one day after shesharply dissentedfrom one such emergency-docket decision: a ruling allowing Trump to fire Biden-appointed consumer safety regulators despite a federal law saying they can only be dismissed due to misconduct or inability to serve.

Kagan offered a veiled critique of her conservative colleagues’ approach, suggesting they “understand interference in an elected president's ability to execute his agenda as sort of automatically irreparable harm” that entitles the administration to emergency relief from the high court.

“I think we're going to continue to have disagreements about that,” she said.

But Kagan’s main complaint about the emergency docket was that the high court’s rulings are often not explained much and sometimes not explained at all, leaving lower courts and the public to guess at the court’s rationale.

“That’s not the right way to approach it,” she said. “As we have done more and more on this emergency docket, there comes a real responsibility that I think we didn't recognize when we first started down this road to explain things better.”

Kagan said she is often disappointed on the current court by finding herself “on the losing end with two fairly predictable women.”

“I don’t enjoy that. I find it frustrating. I find it disappointing. I find it sometimes even maddening,” she said. “It’s just a fact of the matter that this sometimes happens on cases that I care strongly about. … You just sort of have to turn a page.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fcc-approves-skydance-merger-paramount-222356838.html,2025-07-24 23:45:00,FCC approves Skydance merger with Paramount,"A merger betweenParamountGlobal and Skydance Media has been formally approved by the Federal Communications Commission,following months of uncertainty and skepticism.

The $8.4 billion deal was formally approved by theTrumpadministration Thursday, afterFCCcommissioners voted 2-1 along party lines, meaning that Skydance will take control of Paramount in the coming weeks.

In a statement accompanying the deal's approval,Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carrhailed the merger as an opportunity to bring more balance to the “once-storied” CBS network.

“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,"" Carr said.

It comes after a period of turmoil revolving around President Donald Trump’s legal battle with “60 Minutes,” the crown jewel of Paramount-owned broadcast network CBS.

Paramount earlier this month agreed to pay a $16 million settlement with Trump,following fears the president would block the long and hard-fought deal with Skydance.

Critics described the settlement as a thinly-veiled “bribe” to appease Trump, amid rising concerns over the state of editorial independence in the U.S. news media.

Further outrage also emerged after CBS said it was canceling Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” just days after the comedian sharply criticized the parent company’s settlement on air. Paramount cited financial reasons for the show’s cancelation, but big names both within and outside the company have questioned those motives.

Earlier this week Skydance reassured the Trump administration that it would eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies and hire an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias” at CBS News once the merger has been completed.

In letters to Carr, Skydance’s general counsel Kyoko McKinnon noted that while Skydance “does not have DEI programs in place today,” the company confirmed that the New Paramount would not establish any similar practices in the future.

Carr also gloated Tuesday morning over the abrupt cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s late-night CBS show – which was announced last week.

“The partisan left’s ritualist wailing and gnashing of teeth over Colbert is quite revealing,” he said. “They’re acting like they’re losing a loyal DNC spokesperson that was entitled to an exemption from the laws of economics.”

Carr’s post came the morning after Colbert fired back at Trump directly for celebrating that he “got fired,” telling the president to “go f*** yourself” during a ‘Late Night’ monologue that also saw him promise that “the gloves would be off” over his final 10 months on air. The show is expected to continue through May 2026.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the court for an emergency stay that would stop Boston-based U.S. District Judge William Young’sruling last month, which halted the cancellation and forced the government to reinstate several of the grants.

The case centered on a legal challenge by researchers, unions and a coalition of 16 Democratic-led states. They sued the administration after the NIH terminated grants supporting research on topics such as health equity, racial disparities, vaccine hesitancy and maternal health in minority communities.

The abrupt cancellations were part of the administration’s quest to slash spending and end federal support for initiatives Trump officials considered to be promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

“The district court’s order directs the NIH to continue paying $783 million in federal grants that are undisputedly counter to the Administration’s priorities,” DOJ wrote in the filing.

“Following the change in Administration, the NIH identified, explained, and pursued new funding priorities. That is democracy at work, not, as the district court thought, proof of inappropriate ‘partisan[ship]’—let alone a permissible basis for setting agency action aside,” the filing stated.

The Trump administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to step in when its policies have been blocked by lower courts. Thursday’s filing was the administration’s 21st emergency application since Trump took office, and the White House has found success in nearly every single instance.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/media-got-smart-las-vegas-055543394.html,2025-07-25 08:00:00,‘The media got smart:’ Las Vegas Metro police admits to asking justice court to withhold public records,"LAS VEGAS (KLAS) – The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department violated an agreement it made in court to release documents to a news outlet and admits to working with the city’s justice court to determine, in some cases, which public records Metro wants the court to release to the media, the 8 News Now Investigators have learned.

KLAS-TV, the official broadcast home of 8 News Now and 8NewsNow.com, requested a police report with regard to an attempted murder that appeared on Metro’s logs from July 7. Metro, whose robust public information and records offices include a bureaucratic hierarchy of uniformed personnel, civilians and attorneys, denied that request. In doing so, Metro offered its standard three-page boilerplate denial.

The reporter working the story, the Edward R. Murrow and Emmy-award-winning 8 News Now Investigator David Charns, then asked the Las Vegas Justice Court for the arrest report under the belief that once the document was part of the court’s file, it was up to the court to determine whether to release it to the media. The Justice Court judge assigned to the file, Nancy Bernstein, held a hearing on July 16 to weigh Charns’ motion to release the document with Metro’s desire to block it.

“I believe there’s a new way of handling these type of issues as far as the media release,” Bernstein said, indicating she had until July 21 to rule on the issue. “This is going to be a case that hasn’t been heard in any other department yet in Justice Court.

Charns and an attorney for Metro, Martina Bauhaus, explained their respective positions to Bernstein before ultimately agreeing that Metro would provide the arrest report to 8 News Now at a preliminary hearing on July 24. In violation of Bernstein’s order accepting that agreement, neither Metro nor the Justice Court provided any such documentation to an 8 News Now Investigator present for the hearing, over the reporter’s strenuous objection, which the Justice Court referred to as his “abrupt statement on the record.”

The July 24 hearing, which was ultimately scrubbed because the defendant arrested for attempted murder and other counts, Justin Tribble, was indicted that same day in District Court on the same charges. Tribble, 24 and confined to a wheelchair, is being held at Clark County Detention Center on $750,000 bail. That bail amount caught Charns’ attention and ultimately led him to inquire further about Tribble’s July 7 arrest.

“In our opinion, it’s in the public interest to know why that is, what are the details of the case, and why both police arrested him and why a judge would set bail so high,” Charns said.

Bauhaus, who chastised Charns for not filing a motion on 8 News Now’s behalf in a hearing Bernstein originally scheduled and ordered Charns to attend, explained Metro’s position.

“The media got smart and circumvented the process of us denying it,  went to the court – and the court, not knowing that they were denied by us – would release it,” Bauhaus said in open court. “The court is now getting the information of when we deny somebody and then they look at it and see if they agree with it.”

Unaware of that aspect of the relationship between Metro and the Justice Court, the 8 News Now Investigators asked Metro’s public information office for clarification, to which Metro responded, in part: “To prevent the release of information that could endanger an individual or group involved in an active case, the justice court agreed to consider withholding records when LVMPD does. A simple process was created whereby LVMPD informs the justice court when LVMPD has denied a request for an arrest report.”

Colleen McCarty, an attorney at the firm Ballard Spahr, represents KLAS-TV in certain cases where its news organization is fighting for certain First Amendment rights or other journalistic freedoms. McCarty, an Edward R. Murrow award winner in her own right, worked at 8 News Now earlier in her pre-law career. McCarty was unaware and expressed concern about Metro notifying the court of its refusal to disseminate public record. She noted that Metro’s blanket denial statement was inapplicable in Tribble’s case.

“Why does Metro get that kind of access to the judge behind the scenes, but Channel 8 has no ability to respond?” McCarty asked in an interview on Thursday with the 8 News Now Investigators.

She added: “Journalists have a job to do and the public has a right to know, and they have a right to know right now. Not when it’s convenient for everyone else to figure out when they want to provide something for you.”

Late Thursday, Metro responded to 8 News Now’s multiple requests for Tribble’s arrest report by sending the unremarkable yet heavily-redacted three-page document and thus fulfilling both Bernstein’s order and the agreement Bauhaus and Charns made at the July 16 hearing.

Neither Metro nor the Las Vegas Justice Court answered the 8 News Now Investigators’ questions about the logistics of the police department leaning on the court to withhold certain public records. Those questions included:

Is this a regular pattern/practice of LVMPD to request that the court decline to provide records as requested by the media?

For this particular matter, what was the mechanism by which Metro communicated its request, leading the court to decline releasing certain records to the media (i.e. Who from Metro communicated the request, how was it communicated, and to whom was it communicated)?

On what legal basis/bases did Metro make this request to the court, assuming that it did?

Did Metro or its representatives conduct any communication directly with Judge Bernstein, and if so, what was said and by whom?

Metro’s statement, excerpted above, said in its entirety:

“LVMPD receives a great number of requests from the media for arrest reports within days or even hours of an arrest.  Arrest reports generally contain significant details concerning the case, including names of victims and witnesses, details of what they said, and the factual basis supporting the arrest.  In most cases, LVMPD provides arrest reports upon request.

However, in certain situations, law enforcement or privacy interests may require reports to be withheld temporarily.  For instance, if there are outstanding subjects, the release of information may hinder law enforcement’s ability to apprehend the subject.  In other cases, the victim may be at risk and their privacy may need to be protected.

The media started seeking reports from Justice Court in those rare cases when LVMPD temporarily denied access.  To prevent the release of information that could endanger an individual or group involved in an active case, the Justice Court agreed to consider withholding records when LVMPD does. A simple process was created whereby LVMPD informs the Justice Court when LVMPD has denied a request for an arrest report.

In the case of Justin Tribble, law enforcement and privacy interests dictated that LVMPD temporarily deny access to his arrest report.  Pursuant to the new process, LVMPD informed the Justice Court.

Thereafter, Justice of the Peace Nancy Bernstein set a hearing for July 16.  LVMPD did not seek a hearing but was encouraged to attend.  David Charns, LVMPD counsel, and an LVMPD sergeant appeared.

After the hearing, the parties and the judge agreed that the arrest report would be withheld until the facts of the case are presented at the preliminary hearing, which is currently scheduled for July 24.”

Tribble is due in District Court on his first post-indictment hearing on July 30.

Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the go-ahead to eliminate the positions of 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees in its push to dismantle public education as we know it in this country.

Along with personnel cuts that will reduce the agency by half,  nearly $7 billion already allocated by Congress for K-12 education nationwide slated for release on July 1 was also withheld hours before it was to be disbursed. The only warning the states got was a three sentence email on June 30 announcing the freeze.

This has blown a$230 million sized holein budgets throughout Pennsylvania’s public education systems, prompting Gov. Josh Shapiro to join 23 states and the District of Columbia in suing the Trump administration for withholding funds already allocated by Congress.

Stakes are high. The Philadelphia school district, the largest in the state, also accounts for the fourth largest expenditure of federal education funds to any school district in the nation.

In keeping with President Donald Trump’s promises on the campaign trail “to return the responsibility for education to the states,” the administration has begun severing the partnership between the federal government and the states.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Conservative lawmakers and their wealthy patrons have had nearly two centuries to warm to the idea of publicly financed education for America’s young people. During that time, their affection for universal education has only grown colder.

The idea that tax dollars should subsidize the educational aspirations of all Americans — including economically disadvantaged children — appears to be anathema to a class that preaches individual initiative as the only legitimate path to an egalitarian future.

The federal Department of Education offered no explanation for its action, but a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget stated without citing  any evidence that “grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”

The $230 million previously earmarked for “after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students” according to reporting in the Capital-Star is mission critical, but the OMB and DoE made no promises about how long a full review of the allocated funds will take.

The downstream effects of Washington refusing to disburse the earmarked funds that Congress has already approved will be felt immediately in the commonwealth’s ability to plan most things requiring federal assistance moving forward. Again, the uncertainty this generates may be the point.

This is where a look at how the abrupt pulling of federal funds earmarked for Philadelphia schools is particularly instructive. Philly schools have been in crisis for years and can’t raise enough revenue to cover its annual budget without the infusion of city, state and federal funding.

Last year, the school district received $9.13 million for recruiting and teaching teachers, principals and staff through Title II-A; It received $4.6 million for instruction for English-learning and immigrant students under Title III-A and $13.2 million for academic enrichments, technology, student well-being and improving conditions in schools under Title IV-A.

On July 18, the Trump administrationagreed to release $1.3 billionof the $6.8 billion it froze. This will keep 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants that fund summer and after-school programs under Title IV-B chugging along. Philly schools received $12.6 million in Title IV-B funding last year, so this is good news even if it leaves the bulk of the school district’s budget underfunded.

This is why Gov. Shapiro and his colleagues are hoping to be successful  in their suit against the Trump administration. The Founding Fathers insisted that the most reliable bulwark to tyranny is an educated and informed electorate.

This democratic ideal is worth more than the weight of standing armies. Generations of politicians have operated with a similar conviction: that a democracy is only as good as its schools.

Without the federal dollars already promised, Pennsylvania and its public school districts  will have to come up with a funded alternative plan that addresses the needs of its most vulnerable students at a time of maximum partisanship.. Breaking America’s social contract to educate its children is a no-brainer for Donald Trump, a man who has no respect for anything as genteel as a social contract — or any contract.

Trump’s own venture into education before his presidency was a sketchy diploma mill called Trump University. The seeds of his contempt for higher learning are visible in that scam in which he was ordered to pay a $25 million class action settlement to 6,000 students enrolled in the fake university that bore his name.

Education is not among Trump’s strong suits, but that won’t prevent him from holding the educational futures of Pennsylvania students or students across the nation hostage to his whims.

“We won with young,” Trump bragged shortly after winning the Nevada caucuses nine years ago when most failed to take him seriously or literally. “We won with old. We won with highly educated people. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated,” he said to much derision.

A celebration of the “poorly educated” wasn’t a subversive attempt at humor on Trump’s part. It was an excruciatingly honest declaration of his intent. The poorly educated are a big part of his constituency. By slashing the education budget of Pennsylvania schools, he’s just trying to — expand his base."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/pinellas-school-leaders-rally-community-162000570.html,2025-07-25 17:15:00,Pinellas school leaders rally community over federal funding cuts,"School districts across the country felt some relief Friday afternoon when the U.S. Department of Education deemed its review of frozen federal funds was complete. The department announced it would begin releasing money to local districts next week after facing a lawsuit and bipartisan pressure.

Pinellas County school board chair Laura Hine credited the power of community input for the reversal.

“The unanimous interest from across our community in the funding of their schools — including our elected officials — was powerful and yielded results,"" she said.

The night before, Pinellas County school leaders urged community members to rally for the release of those funds.

They presentedwhat was at stakewith an initial $9 million in funding being withheld from them by the U.S. Department of Education.

District Superintendent Kevin Hendrick said a little under $1 million had been recently released before Thursday for after-school and summer enrichment, and the state also released around $2 million in unspent rollover funds from the previous year. The district had around $1 million budgeted for unexpected expenses in the categories the funds are tied to. The Juvenile Welfare Board also stepped in to provide $600,000 toward mental health care services.

The fate of the remaining $5 million caused uncertainty for the coming school year.

Though the district said no employee would lose their job, 13 English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) positions could have been eliminated and those employees would be reassigned. Four human resource positions were slated to be reassigned. Funding for professional development, new teacher mentoring and adult literacy and workforce education also faced cuts.

“The board unanimously believes that program reviews for compliance is completely reasonable,” Hendrick said Thursday. “What we argue is that the timing of this review is not reasonable. To do so the day before a fiscal year begins, when we’ve hired 47 people off of these grants into positions, is not a reasonable expectation.”

Community members had a chance to ask school officials questions about what comes next. Some asked if they could expect to not receive the funds at all.

“Could they be repurposed?” Hendrick said. “They could. Could they be never given out? They could. Might they be given out tonight? Maybe. But we don’t know.”

The abrupt halt in funding would have impacted teachers who rely on federal grants for professional development, classroom support and other benefits.

Former Pinellas County teacher Kristi Carroll is among the many educators who did not have an education degree when they began their teaching career. Professional development programs like theTransition to Teachingprogram she participated in were at risk of going away.

“(The program) was really, really helpful in becoming a teacher, because I was a history major, which helped me a lot when I was teaching history, but I needed to learn how to teach,” she said. “I was able to give my students what they needed, but I needed to learn the skill of being a teacher, because it is a skill.”

Sharon Johnson-Levy, school counselor for Bear Creek Elementary School in St. Petersburg, has been involved in the school system since 2010. Johnson-Levy said she believed that if the funds remained frozen, it would be just the first of many cutbacks to the education system.

“Teachers have really taken a blow over the last few years,” she said. “There’s been a lot of support that has been lost way before this. And so there comes a breaking point where some one hero can keep things going, but how far does it go before things start to kind of not work?”

At the meeting representatives for both U.S. Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Kathy Castor expressed support and urged attendees to write letters to their lawmakers.

Danielle Shipp, who attended the town hall and has children in both charter and public schools in Pinellas, said she hopes more parents get involved.

“I just want to make sure our children’s education stays consistent, no matter the administration, whether it’s Democrat, Republican, independent,” she said.

Whitney Fox, whose first child is entering school in fall, said she thought the funding freeze was just the beginning and believed the federal government would bring more of Project 2025, a Republican policy blueprint from the Heritage Foundation, into fruition.

“This is just the beginning,” she said. “There is a plan that has been laid out very clearly. This should not be a surprise to anyone that this is happening. There are more cuts coming to public education. We should be incredibly alarmed. What will we do when the cuts continue to come?”

Hine, the Pinellas school board chair, encouraged the community to stay involved, even after the funds are released.

“Florida’s legislative session is around the corner,” she said. “Let the folks who make the funding decisions for our schools know that this matters to you — that these are your tax dollars, you believe in your schools and you want them funded."""

While appearing Tuesday onErin Burnett OutFront,reporter Andrew Kaczynski shared details about the abrupt phone call with Trump that ended in name-calling.

The call took place afterCNN’sKFilefoundphotos of Epstein and Trumpthat had not been widely reported on before. One photo showed the disgraced financier and sex offender attending Trump’s Plaza Hotel wedding to Maples.

In a separate image, Epstein was seen with Trump and his children at a Harley-Davidson Cafe that same year.

CNN also released a video of Trump and Epstein chattingwith each other at a Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show in New York in February 1999.

Kaczynski told host Burnett that the call, in which he asked Trump about the images, ended with the president slamming CNN as “fake news” and hanging up after he refused to answer questions about his past connection to Epstein.

“We were not on the phone very long. I think our call was about 30 seconds or so,” Kaczynski told Burnett. “But when I asked him about the wedding photo, he said, he sort of paused for a second and then said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me,’ before calling CNN ‘fake news’ and then hanging up on me.”

In a statement to CNN, Kaczynski said, White House communications director Steven Cheung said, ""These are nothing more than out-of-context frame grabs of innocuous videos and pictures of widely attended events to disgustingly infer something nefarious.""

Cheung added: “The fact is that the president kicked [Epstein] out of his club for being a ‘creep.’”

Kaczynski’s heated yet ultra-brief conversation with Trump comes after the Department of Justice and FBIreleased a two-pagememo earlier this month, claiming their Epstein investigation determined that there was no evidence Epstein was murdered or had a “client list” of powerful figures he could potentially blackmail.

Following the memo release, Trump faced scrutiny over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files,particularly from his own base. Since then,both Republicans and Democratshave called on the president and his administration to release more information.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-us-factual-national-archives-153000512.html,2025-07-25 18:15:00,"Opinion - In the US, a factual National Archives still exists — but for how long?","When I arrived in New York City two years ago — a Russian journalist fleeing my country after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine — I was routinely asked: “Do all Russians support Putin?”

A good question, perhaps, but I’m unable to provide a fact-based answer.

When a regime like Russia silences the press, takes control of all branches of government and installs loyalists to oversee historical records, the truth quickly disappears, becoming accessible only to the ruler’s inner circle.

Since Trump’s inauguration, conversations in the U.S. have changed. Now, when I meet Americans, they rarely mention Russian politics outside of the Ukraine war. Instead, they share their anxieties about their own country, often with a nervous laugh.

I recognize that laugh. In Russia, independent journalists and human rights activists spent years laughing over worst-case scenarios — until every single one of them came true. My Ukrainian friends have become masters of gallows humor.

Then Americans ask: “What should we do? What advice do you, who have seen this happen in your country, have for us here in the U.S.?” This again makes me laugh, given we weren’t exactly successful in stopping our own dictator.

Still, hindsight does provide some clarity, and while I don’t have immediate solutions, I do have two urgent suggestions: Safeguard your independent media and defend your national archives.

The war in Ukraine shows how, without a strong independent press and by employing a warped version of history, a dictator can act however they please.

While outsiders struggle to understand how Russians accept Putin’s justification for the invasion as amission to “de-Nazify” Ukraine, a country led by a Jewish president, or as thereclamation of historically Russian territory(a claim that quickly unravels under serioushistorical scrutiny), the reality is that within Russia these narratives are now embedded in the national story.

This is the result of a deliberate reshaping of the historical narrative by the government.

Putin’s first steps in controlling Russia’s narrative was dismantling the post-Soviet independent media. It began with television,shuttering the independent NTVchannel under the pretense of a business dispute.

He then tightened his grip on the media through laws, including the “foreign agent” designation, jailing reporters he disagreed with. Three days after invading Ukraine in 2022, he imposed military censorship, forcing over 1,500 journalists into exile. Today, it isillegal for journalists to contradict the government’s version of events.

This is why, in 2023, a few fellow exiled journalists and I launched theRussian Independent Media Archive: to preserve the fact-based journalism the Kremlin was so intent on erasing. Today, the archive holds 3.5 million documents from 131 (and counting!) independent national, regional and investigative outlets dating back to Putin’s first years in office.

Designed to resist takedowns and censorship, witha powerful search engine, the Russian Independent Media Archive is open to all, empowering readers, researchers and historians to challenge propaganda about a particular era with truth, and to answer questions with verified facts.

Others are better placed than I to say if a similar closing down of free speech and independent media is possible in the U.S.. The signs are certainly there in the Trump administration’saccelerated book banning campaign,ending federal funding for NPR and PBSand shutting downVoice of America.

Beyond that, Trump has unleashed a wave of chaotic actions that have directly harmed innocent people and disrupted businesses both in the U.S. and around the world — from mass deportations and abrupt firings to sweeping tariffs and threats of international conflict.

Amid thisendless barrage of harmful actions, one seemingly benign yet potentially extremely dangerous move risks slipping by unnoticed: Trump’sbid to take control of the National Archives’ leadership.

Putin closed Russia’s archives stealthily, cloaking his actions in language that maintained an illusion of transparency.

In 2004, he signed a Federal Archives Law restricting access to anything labeled a “state secret.” Today, that list includes 119 broad categories — enough to conceal almost anything from public view. As a result, we Russians no longer have access to a trusted record of our country’s past.

If Americans know the National Archives, it’s usually as the home of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. But it’s much more than a home for documents.

It safeguardsbillions of records vital to government transparency, public accountability, historical preservation, veterans’ services and the integrity of elections. These documents hold facts upon which a great many important decisions are made.

If access were restricted or content altered or erased, as is already happening onnumerous government websites, truth, as in Russia, begins to disappear. For as Orwell prescientlywrotein 1984, “he who controls the past controls the future.”

Covering tracks, destroying evidence, blocking websites, interfering in elections, distorting history — it’s hard to say who does it better, Putin or Trump.

But there’s still a crucial difference between my country and yours: In the U.S., your institutions are intact enough that if I ask, “Do all Americans support Trump?” you could still answer based on facts.

The question now becomes: For how much longer?

Residents should prepare for wind gusts of up to 60 mph.

""At 1:37 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located over Otis, or 11 miles east of Great Barrington, moving east at 30 mph,"" states the weather service. ""Expect damage to roofs, siding, and trees.""

Locations impacted by the warning include Becket, Otis, Sandisfield, Otis Wood Lanes, New Boston, Algerie Four Corners, Bonny Rigg Corners, North Otis, Montville, Becket Center, West New Boston, West Becket, East Otis, Cold Spring and West Otis.

The weather service adds, ""For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a building.""

Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.

To guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations:

Lightning safety plan:

When venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place.

Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby.

Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.

Indoors safety measures:

Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors.

Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges.

Wait for the all-clear:

After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.

Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution.

When indoor shelter isn't available:

If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:

Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.

Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.

If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.

Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.

Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.

In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.

Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:

Beware of rapid water flow:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Use the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.

Slow down and drive with care:

On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.

Prioritize visibility

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mayor-brandon-johnson-pledges-no-184600013.html,2025-07-25 21:00:00,Mayor Brandon Johnson pledges no push for property tax hike after CFO recently called one ‘likely’,"Mayor Brandon Johnson is now ruling out seeking a property tax hike in his upcoming budget proposal, an apparent change in course for his administration after a top city official said earlier in the week that they probably would do so.

On Friday, Johnson said he will instead try again to tax the city’s wealthiest residents and corporations. He added that he has “a number” of ideas for progressive revenue, but did not answer when asked to share them.

“The ultra-rich in this city and this state have an opportunity to do a better job in investing in our infrastructure, investing in community safety,” he said.

Johnson told the Tribune that “nothing has changed” when asked about the apparent abrupt switch-up during a news conference.

The mayor’s attempts to raise property taxes to balance this year’s budget were roundly rejected by aldermen. But he said he isn’t turning away from property taxes to close the 2026 budget hole because he’s worried he doesn’t have the votes.

“We’ve always made it very clear from the very beginning that we are going to invest in people and use progressive revenue to ensure that we build the safest, most affordable big city in America,” he said.

Just Tuesday, Chicago’s Chief Financial Officer Jill Jaworski said “it is likely that that will be part of the package” when asked about the mayor calling for a 2026 property tax increase.

But the mayor delivered a clear rejection of the idea Thursday.

“I will not be proposing a property tax increase in my budget. I’m going to continue to work hard to find progressive revenue,” he told ABC 7 Chicago.

The mayor similarly did not specify Thursday to ABC 7 what new taxes and other revenue-raisers he hopes to rely on to balance the city’s budget. He also said it was too early to discuss potential furloughs and layoffs, adding “our workforce is what makes our city strong.”

The 2026 budget fight will begin in earnest after Labor Day.

Johnson, who campaigned promising to not raise property taxes, proposed last year that the city raise them by $300 million to help close a budget gap near $1 billion. Aldermen rejected the plan in an unprecedented50-0 vote.

The mayor’s administration then tried to negotiate several smaller property tax hikes with aldermen, but was rejected each time. The City Council’s decision, alongside Johnson’s opposition to city service and workforce cuts, resulted in a compromise to balance the budget with a fleet of smaller taxes and fees.

The largest was a roughly $130 million hike to the personal property lease tax on cloud computing services, a move that affected software services, including many that businesses rely on.

Johnson notably failed in an earlier effort to tax the rich in 2023 when the “Bring Chicago Home” plan lost in a citywide referendum. The proposal would have hiked taxes on real estate transfers over $1 million to raise money to pay for homelessness services.

Many aldermen fear the sort of kitchen-sink approach they used to land the budget last year will be harder to use this year. Several easier-to-tap options have been exhausted, and the city’s fiscal challenges have only grown as federal funding cuts threaten the city’s already precarious financial position.

Johnson’s top budget officials have long described property taxes as an effective way to bring in predictable, long-term revenue and stabilize the city’s budget.

But in ruling out property taxes as part of the package this fall, the mayor may very well have sensed a trial balloon had popped after several aldermenquickly criticizedthe idea this week."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/montana-ag-producers-beef-trump-220114513.html,2025-07-25 23:00:00,Montana ag producers have a beef with Trump’s tariffs,"A combine harvester in wheat fields at P&J Ranches near Sheridan, Montana, on on Aug. 28, 2019. (USDA Photo / Lance Cheung)

Montana ranchers, farmers and the state’s tourism industry expressed deep concern with President Donald Trump’s tariffs during a press call on Thursday.

Uncertainty is a major issue, they said, and the actions have set the United States up as an “unreliable trade partner” which is damaging to those who depend on markets outside the country.

The Trump administration recently announced new 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, 35% tariffs on Canada, and 50% tariffs on Brazil. Montana exports $2.4 billion goods annually, with Canada accounting for 37% of the state’s total goods exports, according to statistics fromTariffs Cost US, an advocacy organization.

“Instability is the bane of ag producers. We can plan ahead whenever we can. We have so many things we can’t plan for, weather, sickness, disease, all kinds of stuff that we have no kind of control over and never will,” said Benjamin Peterson, a farmer and rancher on E. L. Peterson Ranch, which is just north of Judith Gap. “And you add in governmental and trade instability, it makes it 100 times worse.”

Peterson specifically detailed an issue around markets in Pacific Rim countries like South Korea, Japan and Vietnam. American checkoff marketing campaigns had been effective in those countries — in fact, there’san entire facility in Oregondedicated to marketing American (including Montanan) wheat, catering to a number of international entities interested in wheat products from this country. Montana is the third-leading wheat producing state in the U.S.

Markets in those countries for American products were built over years and fell in a day, Peterson said.

“Those areas and those markets are gone, and the chances of those of us getting those back are very low because they went over and bought cheaper products, maybe not as good a product, but cheaper product from Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Venezuela,” Peterson said about American beef. “We may never get those back.”

The price of beef is high right now, but it’s mostly a demand for low-quality, imported beef. The type many Montana ranchers are raising is of higher quality, and Peterson said the only thing anyone knows going into next year is that price will be volatile.

There’s also a shortage of high-quality cattle, Montana Farmers Union President Walt Schweitzer said.

“Most of the livestock producing stage in the last five years have experienced severe drought, and we haven’t started rebuilding our herd,” Schweitzer said.”And so the reason our cattle prices are high is because of the shortage of live animals to harvest and I’m a little concerned that we’re not going to get through this as quick as we could, just because of the tariffs that are going to be imposed.”

Peterson said baseline costs on fertilizer and minerals have increased. Schweitzer added the tariffs have also put stress on the American food system, which already had a major shock from COVID.

Immigration policy is also a concern and adds cost if more food is grown outside the country.

“We use foreign labor because we don’t have a choice,” Schweitzer said. “So if you take that labor out of the system, food prices are going to go up, and food systems are going to move out of the country, as far as who’s going to grow them.”

Added Peterson: “Good, high-quality food is going to become the food of the rich.”

A farmer, John Wicks, the owner of Tiber Ridge Organics south of Chester, said parts for agricultural tools are becoming a major issue. He recently sold a piece of specialized equipment because the parts came from Europe and were about 24% more expensive this season. He lost money and said he’ll have to rent it if he needs it.

“It just didn’t pencil out to keep it and have that kind of liability if things broke,” Wicks said. “So that was kind of a really difficult period. And then, you know, Montana agriculture is a generational thing, and these policies and these tariffs are pushing for corporate farms to be able to come in and take over these small family farms.”

Larger companies have more capacity to absorb losses, which can put small producers in a bind. Peterson also made a comparison to the 1980s farm crisis, a broad term used to describe various issues that combined to transfer huge numbers of land held by small farmers to larger, sometimes corporate entities.

It also forced numerous farmers to size-up their operations and rely on oft-discussed farm subsidies to make the farms pencil out economically.

“It’s back to the ‘80s of, get big or get out,” Peterson said. “They’re just doing it with a different method.”

Schweitzer also mentioned the alarming rate of mental health issues among farmers and ranchers. Suicides among agricultural producers skyrocked during the Farm Crisisandhave remained high in the years since. Montana consistently has among the highestrates of suicide per capita in the country.

“It’s caused a lot of stress for farmers and ranchers,” Schweitzer said.

Federal policy changes continue impacting the state in other ways, including Montana’s tourism economy.

While Glacier and Yellowstone National Park visitation is up, federal cuts have meant fewer parks employees. That’s been an issue, Explore Whitefish executive director Zak Anderson said during the call.

“This affects visitor services and trail maintenance and traffic flow and really everything, and then that again, it puts more pressure on local businesses and infrastructure to pick up the slack,” Anderson said. “So I guess overall, I would say that what we’re looking for as a community is some stability from policymakers, like avoiding abrupt tariff hikes or policy policy shifts that then change at a whim.”

Anderson said Canadian tourism is down 25% in Whitefish.

There’s also new tariffs on graphite as well as copper, which could also impact Montana. In 2023, for example, there werenearly 400 people working for Montana Resourcesat the Continental Pit Mine in Butte."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/lacking-state-federal-funds-county-010300561.html,2025-07-26 01:45:00,"Lacking state and federal funds, county looks to cut 35 health-care positions","Faced with increased costs and loss of funding from the state and federal governments, Kern County Public Health is looking to cut $3.5 million from its programing and end 35 positions.

Public Health announced last week a hearing regarding health-care cuts would be held at the next Board of Supervisors meeting, scheduled for Tuesday.

The meeting’s agenda was released Thursday afternoon, and in it, the department included a request to eliminate 35 health-care positions — including 27 layoffs no sooner than Aug. 15 — resulting in an estimated $4.8 million in annual savings.

But the county’s proposed reduction in services comes at a time when demand for health care is increasing.

The county’s own proposal to eliminate the 35 positions notes the county consistently ranks among the lowest in the state for health care outcomes and demand for emergency medical services is rising.

“Kern County is experiencing a record high in emergency medical services calls,” Director of Public Health Services Brynn Carrigan wrote in her proposal.

“A rise in emergency medical services calls is an indicator that Kern County’s residents may be suffering from a higher number of acute and chronic illnesses and have limited access to primary and urgent care,” she said.

But costs, particularly labor costs, are rising and the department’s discretionary revenue was reduced by $25 million over the past two fiscal years.

Among the positions proposed for elimination are seven vocational nurses, two nurse practitioners, two medical assistants and four health-care offices services technicians.

Also included on the agenda is the proposed $3.5 million reduction in program spending detailed in documents released by the county last week.

A breakdown of the proposed $3.5 million reduction showed the largest portion of that funding, $2.6 million, would come from a reduction in available services at Public Health’s offices on Mount Vernon Avenue.

Appointments for issues including family planning, sexually-transmitted infection testing and prevention and immunizations would be reduced from 78 to 25 daily, the department said.

Demand for those services is high and Kern County has some of the highest rates of STIs in the state. But Public Health is faced with a $2 million reduction in state funding and abrupt stop work orders from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an anticipated $10.5 million annually.

“The abrupt elimination of funding forced obligated but not yet paid costs to be assumed by the department and disrupted plans to identify other funding sources to sustain activities and staff,” Carrigan wrote.

The cuts come on the heels of a new contract signed between the county and its largest union, Service Employees International Union Local 521.

The county and SEIU announced in May an agreement had been reached after roughly a year of negotiations, including a one-day protest by workers.

Union members repeatedly complained during negotiations they were overworked and overburdened with clients, unable to meet community demands while facing constant attrition to better-paying jurisdictions.

In a statement Friday, SEIU member and public health nurse Suzanne McWhorter said the county had reserve funds for health-care spending that could be used to support services.

“I’m deeply concerned that these cuts to Public Health will only worsen our already alarming STD infection rate, which is 28%, well above the state average,” McWhorter said.

“My clinic in Shafter is being shut down, and I’m being relocated, leaving my town and entire communities like Lost Hills, Wasco and Buttonwillow without health care and resources. Once again, rural areas are being sacrificed and left playing second fiddle to Bakersfield.”

Supervisors will discuss the reductions at their regular meeting at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

A special meeting of the supervisors is scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday to discuss the county’s fiscal year 2025-2026 budget. The county won’t finalize its budget for the next year until Aug. 26."

Moran, in an appearance on ex-MSNBC hostChris Matthews’s Substack podcast, referred toold clipsof Miller while arguing that he’s been “spitting the same kind of venom and lies” as he has in the Trump administration.

In one video, a 17-year-old Miller said that the torture of Iraqis during the Iraq War is the “way to go” because it’s a “celebration of human life and dignity.”

“The cruelty is the point,” said Moran of Miller.

“He’s about power. Trump is his path to power. Trump sees him as essentially putting kind of some intellectual gloss on his own gut instincts and they work together to bludgeon the country with almost a disheartening and depressing level of cruelty and falsehood every day.”

He continued, “I think that’s accurate, fair and true. And it got me fired!”

Moments earlier, Moran argued that Miller “clearly sees lying as a way of exerting power,” calling such moves “deeply wrong” and “a bludgeoning.”

Moran — who has sincelaunched a Substack of his ownsince his ABC News ouster — haspreviously defendedhis June post, saying it was something on his “heart and mind” at the time.

His post — which described Miller as getting “spiritual nourishment” from his “hatreds” — led to swift outrage from top White House officials, including Vice President JD Vance.

He was subsequently suspended by ABC News, which called the post a “clear violation” of the network’s policies. The network would later announce that his contractwould not be renewed.

But the latest meme-stock rally could be even bigger than its predecessor four years ago, when investors piled into recognizable but unloved stocks, such as the video games retailer GameStop and the movie theatre chain AMC, according to the founder of the Reddit forum that helped whip up the frenzy.

Retailer Kohl’s, camera firm GoPro, fast-food chain Wendy’s and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme each staged rapid rallies this week, driven by abrupt surges in trading volume reminiscent of the the meme-stock craze of 2021, when social media memes boosted a collection of struggling stocks, triggering extraordinary and volatile leaps in value.

Actress Sydney Sweeney helped bring clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters into the mania after it was announced the Euphoria and White Lotus star would front the brand’s latest marketing campaign. The company’s shares surged about 10% in trading on Thursday.

Meme stocks are “about to leap-frog in size and scope and scale, so that retail traders are going to redefine what matters”, according to Jaime Rogozinski, founder of thewallstreetbetsReddit forum behind many of the volatile rallies.

“The world of finance is clearly changing, with blockchain technologies encroaching, and AI agents that trade on their own,” he said. “And the collective of retail traders is adapting along with it.”

Rogozinski founded wallstreetbets in 2012, but said Reddit ousted him as a moderator in 2020. His bid to sue the social media company for trademark infringement was dismissed by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit last month.

The forum’s users home in on stocks and share their own research. “It’s a decentralization of power of who can be financial analyst,” said Noor Al, a moderator on wallstreetbets. “Great ideas can now come from anyone, anywhere.

“We’re seeing the power of retail push stocks, sometimes to the tune of billions of dollars, through the power of ideas, the power of community and the power of the people,” he added.

The meme-stock craze of 2021, whichproduced stars such as Roaring Kitty, was a product of the Covid era, when many amateur traders were stuck at home and flush with pandemic stimulus cash.

Whether this latest frenzy produces similar winners is not yet clear. Kohl’s finished the week up 32%, GoPro was up 66% and Krispy Kreme was up 41%. The rallies show some investors are willing to take on more risk, as stocks scale record highs and the market, dominated by big tech, becomes harder to beat.

Often, meme-stock bets are unbound from economic fundamentals, as investors move to support a brand for romantic or ideological reasons. Donald Trump’s Trump Media & Technology Group, home to Truth Social, is valued at more than $5bn on quarterly revenue of about $1m.

The wallstreetbets ethos “has always to some extent been about flaunting and exploiting the ironies, relevance or irrelevance” of the stock market, said Rogozinski, who pointed to Wendy’s, the hamburger chain, as a good example. “Wendy’s has always been a meme that goes back a decade. It brings a smile to my face, because on Reddit there’s always been this thing where they say: ‘Sir, this is a Wendy’s.’

“It’s an inside joke, and I don’t even get where it started. It’s just a meme,” he added. The stock’s fleeting rise – it rallied 10% in two days, but finished the week broadly flat – shows some retail investors do not necessarily care about the typical factors that drive the market, such as tariffs and war in the Middle East. “It’s this ability for us to almost make fun of the financial system.”

Long-term institutional players will always get the last laugh, Rogozinski conceded, because prices will return to normal valuations. “But in the short term there’s lot of money to be had with this volatility, and the fact that stocks are able to move up and down with such ease is but a mere showcase for how the financial system needs a facelift in relevancy.”

While current market conditions do not replicate the low interest rates and retail investor buoyancy of the Covid era, market records and a robust economy have made meme stocks attractive once again for some. “You see all these indications where this is full-blown meme mania,” Brent Kochuba, founder of derivatives-data firm SpotGamma,told Bloomberg.

“The macro economic environment really favors the retail and speculative plays,” agreed Al. “I think were only going to see more speculation and excitement. It’s a good time to tune in, because retail players can react and provide insight faster.”

Days traders are not necessarily bothered by a company’s financial performance, said Rogozinski. “You have this activist, elective investor who is saying, ‘I don’t care what the financial statements look like, I don’t care what the discounted cashflow is, I like the food, I like the video-game store, I like the meme. So dude, you can go back to Excel spreadsheets if you want, but I really like the chicken tenders,’” he said.

There is now a “third component” to investment, beyond supply and demand, he claimed, “which is, ‘dude, I don’t care if you think it’s going to go up or not, or if they have assets or liabilities. I care about this company and I’m going to help it out. I’m going to go buy my jeans from American Eagle.’”"

Some communities across Colorado are expected to reach 100 degrees over the next couple of days.

The high heat won’t last for long. Most of next week is expected to be quite wet, with widespread rain anticipated across the Front Range.

We’ll have clear skies and dry conditions across the region overnight Saturday. Temperatures will fall into the upper 50s and low 60s, which is seasonal for late July. Winds will be light from the south and southwest. As for the high country, temperatures will be chilly with lows in some valleys falling into the 30s.

Temperatures are expected to jump into the upper 90s on Sunday afternoon, accompanied by abundant sunshine. The UV index will be very high, so don’t forget sunscreen if you’re spending extended time outdoors. The record high for Denver is 98 degrees. Winds will turn to the southeast and gust up to 20 miles per hour in the afternoon.

Next week begins with highs near 100 degrees again around the Denver metro. The record high Monday is 100 degrees from 2021. No rain is expected. Temperatures fall back to seasonal levels in the low 90s on Tuesday, with rain showers looking to return late in the day.

The weather pattern then undergoes an abrupt change on Wednesday. Temperatures fall to the upper 70s and low 80s with periodic waves of heavy rain expected. The heaviest rain is currently expected late Wednesday into early Thursday, with more areas of rain and storms Thursday afternoon.

Showers will be ending Friday, Aug. 1. One to two inches or more of rain may fall across the Front Range next week. Drier and warmer temperatures return next weekend, but as of now, the heat looks seasonal and not excessive.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cmx-chateau-theater-close-sunday-000300709.html,2025-07-27 00:45:00,CMX Chateau theater to close on Sunday,"Jul. 26—ROCHESTER — Fade to black. Another movie theater — CMX Cinemas Chateau — is closing this weekend.

On Friday, the Miami, Florida-based CMX Cinemas made the announcement that the 14-screen theater at 3450 East Circle Drive NE would screen its final movies on Sunday.

While abrupt, the announcement was not completely unexpected. CMX Cinemas, which operates 28 theaters in eight states, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the start of July. It previously filed for bankruptcy in 2020, but resolved that with a rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic.

CMX has owned and operated the 26-year-old Chateau theater since 2017. Rochester developer Gus Chafoulias built the 14-screen theater in 2001 and named it as homage to the historic Chateau theater in downtown Rochester.

The CMX closure follows Odyssey Cinemas/CineMagic shuttering Hollywood 12 theater at 2171 Superior Drive NW in August 2024. Echo Church purchased the Hollywood 12 complex and now uses it as a place of worship.

Rochester will now only have one multiplex movie theater — Marcus Galaxy 14 Cine at 4340 Maine Ave SE. The only other local option is Pop's Art Theater, at 619 Sixth Ave. NW, with its single screen. The city, which had 41 movie screens in July 2024, now has 15.

Rochester's movie market has seen many plot twists over the years.

In the late 1990s, there were four theaters with a total of 19 screens and all were controlled by the Carmike theater chain. They were the Theaters at Galleria on the top floor of the downtown mall, Apache 4 theaters by the Apache Mall, Cinema 3 in Northbrook Shopping Center and Barclay Square 6 by TJ Maxx.

By 2004, all of those theaters were closed. Eventually, all of the free-standing theater buildings were demolished and the downtown Galleria theater became part of the University of Minnesota Rochester campus.

Chafoulias built the Chateau Theatre 14 in 2001. Odyssey/CineMagic was building Hollywood 12 at the same time and it opened just months after the Chateau in 2002. The two theaters were fierce competitors until CineMagic bought the Chateau theater from Chafoulias at the end of 2006.

CineMagic had all of Rochester's movie business locked up for almost a year before Wehrenberg Theatres built and opened Galaxy 14 Cine in November 2007 in the Shoppes on Maine area in the southeast quadrant. That theater is now owned by the Marcus movie chain.

The playing field changed again in 2011, when Midwest Theatres Corp., CineMagic's parent company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. While CineMagic sold the Hollywood 12 building, it kept its theater business rolling along there.

Florida-based Paragon Theaters bought and re-launched the Chateau 14 Theater. Paragon then sold it to CMX in 2017."

This articleoriginally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere.

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.

These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.

First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.

Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.

“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”

Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.

Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.

The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.

But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such asKBB.comandEdmunds.comcan provide a big-picture view.

The federal government lists whichnew vehiclesandused vehiclesqualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.

For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of thebest lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.

Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.

You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.

A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.

A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage hasa good roundupof the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)

But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.

At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, andI wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.

I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.

“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”

He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.

Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.

“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”

In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.

Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.

She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled:Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleagueRambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.

Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected:Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, asLora Kolodny reports for CNBC.

Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables:President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands.Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E Newsabout the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.

Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables:A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleagueJake Bolster reports for ICN. On one hand, the Trump administration has taken action to encourage U.S. production of rare earth minerals. On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.

Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs?One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust.Jeff St. John of Canary Media reportson some of the attempts by solar companies to reduce “soft costs” in the process, which includes just about everything other than hard equipment. The industry has long recognized that there is room to cut soft costs, and the companies that survive are likely going to be the ones that figure out how to do it.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/view-california-high-speed-rail-035900114.html,2025-07-27 12:45:00,"Our View: California’s High Speed Rail project is not dead, yet","Celebrating the recent withdrawal of $4 billion in federal funds allocated by Congress to help build the California High Speed Rail system, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy declared, “It’s time for this boondoggle to die.”

Don’t start planning the funeral, just yet. California High-Speed Rail is a long way from dead.

After announcing the abrupt withdrawal of federal money — which accounts for about 25% of the project’s funding — the Trump administration now is faced with yet another lawsuit — this one filed by California — that challenges the president’s reneging on spending federal dollars Congress approved to fund a wide range of programs.

President Trump, a longtime critic of high-speed rail, declared, “I’m thrilled to announce that I have officially freed (taxpayers) from funding California’s disastrously overpriced ‘high speed train to nowhere.’”

No doubt, Californians are disappointed about the increasing costs and delayed construction of California’s high-speed rail system.

In 2008, with Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s encouragement, California voters passed a $10 billion bond measure, most of the money earmarked for construction of a high-speed rail system to carry passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in less than three hours. Initially estimated to cost $40 billion and completed in 2020, the cost is now estimated to be $130 billion.

Since then, the project has contended with increasing construction costs, unexpected construction roadblocks, regulatory red tape, political opposition and environmental concerns. Five executive directors later, construction of an “initial phase” — a 119-mile rail line from Bakersfield to Merced — is 81% completed and expected to be operational sometime between 2030 and 2033.

To suddenly now declare California’s High-Speed Rail system dead, as Duffy has done, would leave the Central Valley an eyesore graveyard of half-completed bridges and billions of dollars abandoned infrastructure. It would waste already spent tax dollars and abandon many communities’ economic development plans.

Dubbed the “train to nowhere” by critics, the Bakersfield to Merced line is a much maligned critical first link in a statewide system that will connect existing and planned local rail lines. The San Francisco to Los Angeles/Anaheim line is eventually expected to connect to a “high desert hub” in Palmdale. That link will connect to Brightline West, a 218-mile private-venture high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Brightline expects to begin service in 2028.

The CHSR authority now is headed by transit veteran CEO Ian Choudri, who was appointed last fall to replace CEO Brian Kelly. Until his retirement, Kelly’s six-year tenure was focused on bringing together transportation planners and Central Valley elected officials, directing funding to support local projects on the ends of the system, and building the Bakersfield to Merced line.

Choudri’s focus now is paying for construction of the entire system. State support — some coming from auctioning pollution-fighting cap-and-trade credits — is not dependable, nor sufficient. Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing the Legislature to allocate $1 billion a year for the project.

Choudri is emphasizing the need for private-public partnerships. The rail authority is requesting proposals for “monetizing” the system’s assets — station facilities, track access, fast cargo and parcel movement, transit-oriented amenities, fiber optic lines along the right-of-way, etc.

An example of the private-public potential is connecting a Central Valley high-speed line to one in the Silicon Valley. If a one-hour commute could be achieved, it would be half the time drivers now experience commuting to the Silicon Valley and would attract investors.

A completed and successful high-speed rail line is an important part of building a statewide system that will improve mobility, stimulate economic development, result in the creation of affordable housing, and reduce pollution.

California’s high-speed rail dream is not dead. But its future depends on stable funding, competent management and creative thinking."

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.

And this week on Face the Nation: Amid a summer of distraction, President Trump seeks ways to divert attention back to his economic agenda. Leaving behind the Epstein files controversy, Trump teed off in Scotland for a weekend of golf, ahead of trade talks with two key European leaders, as his tariff deadline looms.

Before he left, he took his fight with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell straight to the Federal Reserve facility itself, raising questions about renovation costs.

(Begin VT)

DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): It looks like it's about $3.1 billion. It went up a little bit or a lot. So the 2.7 is now 3.1. And…

JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): I'm not aware of that, Mr. President.

DONALD TRUMP: Yes, they – it just…

(End VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We will check in with White House budget chief Russell Vought, who was with the president during his trip to the Fed. Plus, we will ask whether he's eying another round of spending cuts.

And we will get the Democratic response from Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.

Then: Trump's campaign to reshape higher education stretches beyond fines on Ivy League schools. More than 50 top universities are under investigation and at risk of losing funds. We will hear from the president of The Ohio State University, Ted Carter. Finally: Israel announces it will allow aid into Gaza, where the hunger crisis has reached catastrophic levels. When will it stop? We will talk with the foreign minister of France, Jean-Noel Barrot, about international pressure to end the conflict.

It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.

Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.

Washington is a little quieter this week. The House started its recess early. And when they return in September, funding the government will be top priority.

Meanwhile, we're expecting some key economic indicators. The Fed will announce its outlook on interest rates Wednesday and we will see a new jobs report Friday. That's the same day President Trump is set to slap tariffs on dozens of countries, including America's top trading partners.

We begin today with the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought.

Welcome to Face the Nation.

RUSSELL VOUGHT (Director, Office of Management and Budget): Thanks for having me.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's so much to get to with you. Let's start on what's going on with the Federal Reserve.

If you take the president at his word, he does not intend to fire the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, though he's still criticizing him. What is the president seeking in a successor when his term ends in May 2026?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, I think he's looking for a chairman that's not continually too late to the developments in the economic marketplace.

And I think what we've seen with Chairman Powell, he was very late in the Biden administration to raise rates, to articulate the concern with regard to the Biden administration's spending.

We all knew on the outside – even Larry Summers knew that we were going to have an issue with regard to inflation. And we saw, you know, recent historical inflationary levels that we hadn't seen before. And now he is too late to lower inflation rates. And so that is the kind of thing that we want to see in the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.

And one of the reasons why is…

MARGARET BRENNAN: More of a focus on inflation?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: An ability to recognize the developments in the economic marketplace.

In this case, we want to be able to see lower rates and to have an ability to get the economy going.

And one of the things we saw with Powell is that one of the reasons he was so late was because he didn't understand that inflation is largely a monetary phenomenon. He kept saying that inflation was transitory. He didn't tackle the problem. And now he's again too late.

And you marry that with fiscal mismanagement at the Fed. It's a huge problem that we're trying to raise the country's awareness level with.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as you know, the Fed is structured in a way where he doesn't have unilateral control. There's a governing board. Others weigh in.

You did work on Project 2025, and we went back and looked at what they said in there about the Fed. As people may know, that's a Heritage Foundation product that got a lot of scrutiny during the campaign. The chapter on the Fed called for Congress to overhaul the Fed's focus and powers.

Is that what you're looking to do in 2026?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I don't even know what that chapter says.

All I know, in terms of the president, the president has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that. All that we're doing is – in this administration is running on – is implementing his agenda.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't want to overhaul the Fed?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We want an economic system that works for the American people. That includes the Fed. And the president has been very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I do want to ask about spending, or lack thereof, that the Trump administration is trying to direct.

The White House said they will actually release the remaining $5 billion in education funds that had been withheld from public schools until recently. There were 10 Republican senators very worried about this, and came out and said your claim that the money goes to radical left-wing programs was wrong.

What changed your mind? What made you release this money?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, we had been going through a programmatic review with these funds. These are programs that, as an administration, we don't support. We've called for the elimination of them in the president's budget for precisely the reasons of which they flow to often left-wing organizations.

Thankfully, the president came into office, put in an executive order that said it can't – these funds can't go to these types of initiatives. I will just give you one example. English language acquisition was flowing to the New York school public education system to go into illegal immigration advocacy organizations.

Preschool development grants doesn't actually go to preschoolers. It goes to the curriculum for putting CRT into the school system for people as young – children as young as 4 years old.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these senators said it goes to adult learners working to gain employment skills and after-school programs.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: And what we…

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you deemed it is necessary?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We believe that it's important to get the money out right now, but we have taken an extended time frame to be able to make sure it doesn't go to the types of things that we saw under the Biden administration.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, you know, Senator Lindsey Graham told ""The Washington Post"" the administration is looking at considering clawbacks from the Department of Education, this, you know, rescissions process.

Is that the plan? Are you seeking to claw back education funds in a rescissions package? And, if so, when are you sending that up?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We may be. We're always looking at potential rescission options.

This is an – this is a set of funding that we wanted to make sure it got out. We did our programmatic review. We wanted to make sure it got out before the school year, even though it's multiyear funding. This is not funding that would expire at the end of this year. We are looking to do rescissions package.

MARGARET BRENNAN: When…

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We're always gauging the extent to which the Congress is willing to participate in that process. And we're – be looking at a lot of different options along those lines, but certainly have nothing to announce here today.

But we're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So no rescissions package before September?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options. We will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have, but nothing that we're going to announce today.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because some of the funds that do expire in September have also been held up on the health front.

Senator Katie Britt of Alabama, 13 other Republicans came out with a letter saying that you've been slow in releasing funds for the National Institute of Health for research into cardiovascular disease, cancer. Are those funds going to be released?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Again, we're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a time cost here.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I mean, $2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers, that's the kind of waste that we've seen at the NIH.

And that's not even getting to the extent to which the NIH was weaponized against the American people over the last several years, with regard to funding gain of function research that caused the pandemic. We have a – we have an agency that needs dramatic overhaul. Thankfully, we have a great new head of it, but we're going to have to go line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to release the cancer funding research and the cardiovascular disease research funding?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We're going to continue – we're going to continue to go to the same process that we have gone through with regard to the Department of Education at every one of these agencies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Before September, that money will be released?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: And we will release that funding when we are done with that review.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because, as you know, there's concern that you're withholding the money, hoping it just won't be spent.

I mean, if you look at the White House budget, it does call for a 26 percent cut to HHS, $18 billion cut to NIH. Is this just a backdoor way to make those cuts happen?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, I don't want to speak to any specific program with regard to what we might do with regard to rescissions throughout the end of this fiscal year, but we certainly recognize that we have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated and to use the tools that the Impoundment Control Act, a bill we're not – a law that we're not entirely thrilled with, gives us to – to send up rescissions towards the end of the fiscal year.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, just for our viewers, the Impoundment Control Act is the legal mechanism for the president to use to delay or avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress.

Democrats think you want to have an argument over the power of the purse and who holds it. Do you want that to go to the Supreme Court?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, look, for 200 years, presidents had the ability to spend less than the congressional appropriations. No one would ever dispute and our founders didn't dispute that Congress has the ability to set the appropriation ceiling.

But 200 years of presidents, up until the 1970s, had the ability to spend less if they could find efficiencies or if they could find waste that an agency was doing.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We lost that ability in the 1970s. The president ran on restoring that funding authority to the presidency, and it's vital.

If you look at when we started to lose control fiscally, it was right around the time of the 1970s.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, many senators, Republican senators, are very uncomfortable with the tactics that you are using, Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, that chair of the Appropriations Committee that is really running this – this funding process.

And Senator Collins said you're pushing the limits of what the executive can do without the consent of the – of the legislative branch. You need to work with her to get your budget through. And, in fact, you need to also be able to get Democrats on board to get to that 60-vote threshold to pass any kind of government funding to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: I have a great relationship with Senator Collins. I appreciate the work she does.

She is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, so obviously we're going to have differences of opinion as to the extent to which these tools should be used. I mean, she had concerns with the rescissions package. The rescissions package was a vote that Congress had to make these cuts permanent. And yet…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Under – on a party-line vote. She says, you want to go do these clawbacks, you do it through regular order, and you can put – you can put rescissions into an appropriations bill.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: But that was, in fact, under regular order. That's the challenge, is, the appropriators want to use all the rescissions, they want to put them in their bills, and then they want to spend higher on other programs.

We act – we're $37 trillion in debt, Margaret. We actually need to reduce the deficit and have a dollar of cut go to a dollar of deficit reduction. That's not what the appropriators want. And it's not news that the Trump administration is going to bring a paradigm shift to this town in terms of the business of spending the people's money.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would acknowledge that you just added to the debt and to the deficit with this…

(CROSSTALK)

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: No, I would not acknowledge that. We reduced the deficit.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The spending and tax bill that just passed?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Correct. We…

MARGARET BRENNAN: And you lifted the debt ceiling.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: The debt ceiling is an – is – is an extension of the cap on what's needed to pay your previous bills.

In terms of the bill itself, it is $400 billion in deficit reduction, $1.5 trillion in mandatory savings reforms, the biggest we've seen in history.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, a few weeks ago, that the appropriations process needs to be less bipartisan. You only have 53 Republicans. You do need Democrats to get on board, here.

Is saying something like that intended to undermine negotiations? Do you actually want a government shutdown?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: No, of course not. We want to extend the funding at the end of this fiscal year. We understand, from a math perspective, we're going to need Democrats to do that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does less bipartisan mean?

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: Well, Margaret, the whole week, the Democrats were making the argument that, if you pass the rescissions bill, that you were undermining the bipartisan appropriations process.

So, if Brian Schatz and every other appropriator is making that argument for a week…

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, a Republican, said that.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: … you have to be able to respond and say, if you're going to call a rescissions package that you told us during the month of January and February that we should use to do less spending, if you're going to say that is undermining the bipartisan appropriations process, then maybe we should have a conversation about that. That is all it was meant to convey.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the alternative to this process is another continuing resolution, these stopgap measures. Are you open to that, because that would lock in Biden era funding? What is your alternative here? If you want a less bipartisan process, how do you solve for this? Because it sounds like you're laying the predicate for a shutdown.

DIRECTOR RUSSELL VOUGHT: We are open to – we are not laying the predicate for a shutdown. We are laying the predicate for the fact that the only thing that has worked in this town – the bipartisan appropriations process is broken.

It leads to omnibus bills. We want to prevent an omnibus bill, and all options are on the table to be able to do that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Russell Vought, thank you for your time today.

Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is one of those appropriators we were just speaking about with the budget director.

You just heard everything he laid out. There were no specifics on when these clawbacks could be coming, but they're on the table. He says they don't want a shutdown. He didn't seem to say they want a continuing resolution.

Do you know what's coming?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Maryland): Not really.

The one thing we know – and you asked Russ Vought about this – was, he says that the process is too bipartisan right now, meaning that they want to use this process just to ram through the agenda. And the overall agenda, we saw when they passed the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which was beautiful for billionaires, but not really for anybody else, which is to provide tax cuts for very wealthy people at the expense of everybody else.

And I do want to say, Margaret, I heard him deny that that bill increased the deficit and debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office just said it increased our debt by $3.5 trillion before added interest.

MARGARET BRENNAN: He's using an accounting gimmick in regard to the benchmark.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: As – and Republicans have called out this accounting gimmick. So, when they come…

MARGARET BRENNAN: But it was accepted.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, they sort of unilaterally imposed it. It was not accepted by Democrats.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And it was a departure from previous efforts.

But then they come back and they say that they want to cut these important programs, NIH and other things, to reduce the deficit, when, in fact, what they're doing it for is to help try to finance those tax cuts for very wealthy people.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's just heading us towards pretty unchartered territory and very unclear whether we will be able to avoid a government shutdown.

Democrats are going to be blamed if there's a shutdown, don't you think? I mean, how do you sidestep this?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we certainly don't want a government shutdown. And I think everybody has heard Russ Vought say that they want a less bipartisan process.

What that tells me is they're willing just to use their powers to try to shut down the government if they don't get their way. And what's ironic about this, Margaret, is, you have Russ Vought calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.

He asked for a 13 percent increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff, while he's talking about RIFing people at other departments, like the Department of…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, getting rid of firing people in the Department of Veterans Affairs and other important priorities.

So it's hard to take the OMB director seriously when he says that they didn't increase the debt and when he says he wants to cut things, except for his own budget and staff.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But if they do head towards a government shutdown, why would there be any benefit, unless it is to prioritize funding certain agencies and deprioritizing other agencies?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, that…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that goes back to the executive, doesn't it, that authority?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, that – ultimately, though, you need, for example, four Republican senators to stand behind what he's calling for.

And what they called for is sort of just a double cross on the process, right? That's what the so-called – rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross. They support one thing one day. The president even signs off. And then they come back and say they changed their mind.

And what we're asking is for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that, when they say they're going to fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That they won't later agree to claw that money back.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Exactly.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

So one of the things the Trump administration is clear and did get clawbacks of is foreign assistance. However, there's an exception. In June, the administration announced it would give $30 million to this Israeli- backed organization called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the GHF. I know you're familiar with it.

It delivers aid through armed military contractors who stand behind the Israeli military in four designated zones that Gazans then have to get themselves to in order to receive the aid. The State Department says they're sending this money. Have they?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: To my knowledge, they have. Although we have asked for the details, we haven't gotten them.

In fact, just today, I'm sending a letter to Secretary Rubio signed with 20 of my colleagues calling for more information, but also calling for defunding this. American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap.

Over 1,000 people have died from being shot and killed as starving people crowd to try to get food at just these four sites.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The – just to be clear here, the State Department says they're going to send $30 million.

Reuters had reported that there were documents they obtained showing $7 million had already been sent to these what you call armed mercenaries. But the Trump administration says this is the best way, this is the only way to keep money – to keep food out of the hands of Hamas, which financially benefits off reselling it to desperate, starving people.

Is there another way to feed desperate, starving people?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes. And this is a big lie, the claim that, when the U.N. organizations were delivering food to Palestinians, civilians, that it was being systematically diverted to Hamas.

I want to say loudly and clearly this is a big lie. Trump and the…

MARGARET BRENNAN: The systematic part of that?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: The systematic, but that is their claim. They claim that essentially large amounts of aid are being diverted to Hamas.

What we know now from testimony of American officials, Cindy McCain and just this week high-level Israeli military officials is that there's no evidence to support that. AID – USAID just released a report saying there's no evidence to support that.

So what the Netanyahu government did was scrap a delivery system that was working at delivering food and assistance in favor of this other effort. That was a pretext, this claim that Hamas was systematically diverting food. The real goal of this other effort is to use food as a weapon of war and population control.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a violation of international law.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, it is.

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a human rights abuse.

Senator Lindsey Graham was on ""Meet the Press"" this morning. And I want to ask for your reaction to something he said, because he was very strong in his words.

He said, because the cease-fire talks fell apart, Israel's reassessing. He said to expect a full military effort by Israel to take Gaza down – quote – ""like we did in Tokyo and Berlin. They're going to do in Gaza what we did in Tokyo and Berlin, take the place by force, start over again, present a better future.""

The United States is a huge supporter of the state of Israel. Is there anything that could prevent what he says is about to happen?

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States should make very clear that it's unacceptable to use U.S. weapons to target or indiscriminately fire on civilians and civilian infrastructure. So…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because this sounds like an occupation.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we also know just this week members of the Netanyahu coalition, in fact, government ministers, called for essentially erasing Gaza, and they said it will become a Jewish state, statelet, and part of – so this was one of the…

MARGARET BRENNAN: Netanyahu did say he didn't agree with the statement.

SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, here's the problem, though, Margaret.

We continually see that Netanyahu at the end of the day does cater to his most far right wing of his government, people like Ben-Gvir, people like Smotrich. That is what has allowed him to stay in power. And so, at the end of the day, he takes the most extreme positions.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, thank you for your time today.

Stay with us.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.

We turn now to the crisis in the Gaza Strip where Israel's partial pause in fighting will end in a few hours. Our Elizabeth Palmer has the latest.

(BEGIN VT)

ELIZABETH PALMER (voice over): In an abrupt reversal, Israel cleared the way for more aid to Gaza. Overnight, the military air dropped food and supplies. But those pallets are a fraction of what's needed. The bulk of the aid is on trucks, waiting to go. And in what could be a game changer, Israel says it will establish secure routes through the war zone so that trucks will no longer be shot at or looted.

Gaza's misery has shocked the world. And international medical agencies say children, especially the poorest and those with special needs, are suffering from acute malnutrition.

Since March, when the ceasefire ended, aid has trickled into the war zone, but not nearly enough. Israel sidelined the main U.N. agencies and funneled most aid through the privately run Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has only four distribution hubs for 2 million people.

As hunger grew, so did reports of Israeli soldiers shooting a crowds trying to get something to eat. Even so, desperation pushed Gazans to risk death, plundering aid from moving convoys.

Alongside the shooting war, there was also a war of words. Israel's military insisted it was letting in plenty of aid, it's just the U.N. agencies weren't picking it up. The agencies said the army made it too dangerous.

And while the blame game played out, Gazans grew thinner and sicker.

Now, Israel has announced a change of policy. Aid has begun moving under the new rules today. For Gazans, it's not a minute too soon.

(END VT)

MARGARET BRENNAN: That was our senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer.

We turn to the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who joins us this morning from Paris.

Welcome to FACE THE NATION.

I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation. Overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states, are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT (Foreign Minister of France): What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is – is – is now on the brink of a food catastrophe. And we've been working out over the months to try and relieve the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in Elavish (ph), in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza.

So, we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity afforded by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: We have with the European Union started tough discussions with the Israeli government who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused blood bath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions.

We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects, with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political – a two-state solution.

But what we call for is, of course, the immediate ceasefire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed, and the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two-state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the U.N. in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first Western U.N. Security Council member to do so.

And the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it ""reckless."" He says it ""serves Hamas propaganda,"" ""sets back peace,"" and considers it ""a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.""

In your government's view, why is he wrong?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: So, we – the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two-state solution process, that was – that is today threatened, more threatened, that it – it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone because by work – by – by recognizing or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has – that will be co-chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant, historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of this two- state solution and guarantee its security guarantees for (INAUDIBLE).

The two-state solution is very simple. And I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back into this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and in security. And what we're doing by bringing the Palestinian authority leader to recognize 7th of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas – the disarmament for the – the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating or recreating the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward. And we are paving the way.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said. The U.S. ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary. We shall – the short-term objectives, ceasefire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas and the long-term objective, peace and stability in the region.

But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics (ph), a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the – or create an off-ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza.

Now, the terms we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords. But in the meantime, inaction is not an option.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out, though, and said, ""the French students were removed because they're Jewish."" Have you determined whether this was, indeed, an act of anti- Semitism?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has – to express our – our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in – in France, and we've made the same request. We keep following this situation as it unravels.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to – to early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point.

MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon and the world won't know.

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing. And alongside the Germany and the U.K., we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority, in close coordination with U.S. authorities, in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant roll-back of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things have changed. Until then and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement.

We now want more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also its – the ballistic component as well as the regional destabilization activity that Iran has been conducting. Unless we – unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the U.K. will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted ten years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment and on banking.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So, France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?

JEAN-NOEL BARROT: Oh, we've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We – we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran after the 12-day war to go back to a discussion with the U.S. And we'll keep pressing them to do so because indeed if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning.

We'll be back in a moment.

(ANNOUNCEMENTS)

MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Columbus, Ohio, and the president of The Ohio State University, Ted Carter.

President Carter, welcome to FACE THE NATION.

TED CARTER (President, Ohio State University): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you on this Sunday from Columbus, Ohio.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I wanted to ask you very directly about these Trump administration claims that Ohio State is one of 60 universities that they deemed may have anti-Semitic practices and policies on campus. They say you're being investigated for them and for failing to end diversity policies, which could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act. What's the status of the probes and – and how much pressure are you under?

TED CARTER: To be quite frank, I'm not feeling a lot of pressure. Our understanding is that we're on those lists because we had been previously on those lists under the Biden administration. We had been working with the Office of Civil Rights during that administration. And I think mostly that was a holdover.

We are more than happy to talk to anybody from the Office of Civil Rights. We stand behind our actions. We know how we acted during the time of the protests. We never had an encampment here at Ohio State. We had some attempted. We didn't allow them. That's our long-standing rules on The Oval, which is the centerpiece of our campus. So, I'm confident that as this played out forward, that we're going to be just fine.

MARGARET BRENNAN: The Trump administration did publish Ohio State on the list of universities it's probing. And when you look at some of the issues they've raised at other places, you look at the results of freezing $3 billion in contracts at Harvard, $1 billion at Cornell, hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding at universities like Brown. Are you worried that your federal funds could be in jeopardy because of this?

TED CARTER: Well, like I always say to my staff and my people, if we do the right things for the right reasons, everything will play out. And we've been doing it that way since I've been here since 1 January of 2024. Our research funding here at Ohio State has grown leaps and bounds over the last couple years. We're actually ranked number 11th in the country, ahead of Harvard, ahead of UNC-Chapel Hill. Our revenues last year were $1.6 billion, $775 million of that came from the federal government, largely in NIH and NSF.

As we sit here today, we've had some research grants impacted, but in the tens of millions of dollars. Nothing like you're seeing at our Ivy League colleagues. And a lot of that is still in litigation. So, I can't even tell you what the – the number of dollars that we may lose. But against the $1.6 billion, it's pretty small, even though it's had some impact on some of our researchers.

Unlike some of our counterparts, we have a significant research arm here, 14,000 faculty, post doc students that do the research here, and it is significant. It goes way beyond the numbers and the dollars. It's what it's doing for the community, what it's doing to extend and save and change lives and what it's doing in agriculture, what it's doing for our police force.

So, what I would tell you is the – at this moment today, even compared to where we were last year, we're still up in our research revenue about 7 percent from where we were last year. And we're – we're proceeding to ask for more grants so that we can be a cancer-free world here in our lifetime.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we all hope for that future, sir.

But you sound not to be concerned, but I did read that earlier when you had the Buckeyes football team at the White House earlier in the year, and that was well covered, ""The Wall Street Journal"" said you told President Trump and Vice President Vance that, quote, ""Ohio State is not the enemy.""

Why did you feel you had to say that? What did you mean?

TED CARTER: Well, that might have been taken a little bit out of context. I kind of said that in jest a little bit to the vice president when I had a chance to meet with him. And we had a long conversation. It was a very productive conversation. I won't go into all the details.

But the point is, they know that Ohio State is doing the right things for the right reasons. I have said publicly that I believe the future of higher education is going to go through the large public land grant flagship institutions like The Ohio State University.

I look at what we're doing today. And, yes, like many other universities, there's a lot of concern about the future, what's coming out of the federal government, and even what's coming out of our state government here in Ohio. But right now, I feel like we can still play defense, still understand how to adjust, kind of make sure that we're getting our bat on the ball, so to speak, and playing defense and protecting the plate. But we're also looking at how we can play offense.

This is a time where institutions like Ohio State, we are very financially secure. We're actually looking to invest in ourselves. You know, I just reflect on the graduation ceremony that we just had this past May. We produce about 18,000 graduates a year. But at that ceremony, we graduated 12,400. All of them, by the way, got their diploma that day that they earned. And 90 percent of those students, 90 percent, already had a job or they were going to another higher academic endeavor. And 70 percent of those undergraduate students are staying in the state of Ohio, 66 percent of the Ph.D. and masters are staying in the state of Ohio.

This is a wonderful workforce development program that is what is raising the confidence of Ohioans and the American public in higher education. And that is starting to change.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Vance was on this program a number of times. And one when them when he was still a senator. I spoke to him about his views on higher education. He is an Ohio State alum undergrad. And he said he believes universities – he wasn't speaking of yours, but he said ""universities are controlled by left-wing foundations and they're going in the wrong direction.""

Do you think he has a point?

TED CARTER: I think higher education has started to build that reputation. And you can even see that in the Gallup-Lumina polls. You know, I was the superintendent of the Naval Academy from 2014 to 2019. You know, in that Gallup poll in 2015 said that nearly 60 percent of Americans had high confidence in post-secondary education.

Now, go ahead and just move that needle nine years forward, and yet two in three Americans said they did not have confidence in higher education. That's a really bad mark. Americans were saying higher education costs too much. They were saying that the return on investment was difficult to prove. They were even saying some of the research being done may not impact them or their families. And, yes, there was this conversation about the potential indoctrination of students or that institutions were leaning very liberal.

You know, we, as administrators of higher education, maybe ought to listen to the American public and say, maybe we haven't always gotten it right. So, I'm here to say here at The Ohio State University, we have paid attention to that. We are making efforts to make affordability a key issue for students.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

TED CARTER: I mentioned that graduating class, 57 percent of those undergraduates left with zero debt. Zero debt. And the other 43 percent that left with debt was less than $24,000. And as we look across, you know, our hiring practices, I have 8,500 faculty.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

TED CARTER: It is the best group of faculty I have ever worked with in my 12 years in leading in higher ed, and that's saying quite a bit.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I – on that –

TED CARTER: And I will tell you that as we hire the future, we're looking across the entire political spectrum for who we hire.

MARGARET BRENNAN: On that point, you talked about what happened at the state level. The Republican-controlled state legislature passed a law that eliminates the diversity programs, does a number of things, but it also requires professors to post their course syllabus, syllabi, online, and their contact information.

Do you think that this is meant to intimidate? Are you concerned? Is your faculty concerned about the focus on what they're doing?

TED CARTER: Yes, I have talked to our faculty, our – you know, through our faculty senate and our leadership. There are some concerns, of course, because we have not done that before. We've got some time before we implement that. We have put all the pieces of Senate Bill 1, which is the general assembly's bill here in the state of Ohio, into implementation phase. We're still working through some of the details.

But let me tell you, the principles of academic freedom, what is taught in the classroom, the – the move towards scholarly pursuit, the research that we do here at Ohio State, those are things that we are still very passionate about. And I know that we're going to continue that work. And yet we'll still follow the law. We'll still follow some of the federal policies that are coming out. We're ready and prepared to do all of that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to – to that point, you saw what Columbia University did this week in paying that $200 million fine to settle their dispute with the Trump administration. They also agreed to an outside monitor to assure the school complies with stamping out diversity programs.

Does this precedent trouble you? I mean, would you take a deal like that?

TED CARTER: Well, I can't speak to those institutions because I'm not leading them. I – I know both the – President Shipman and some of the other Ivy League presidents. They're colleagues. And they're having to do, I think, what I would call be in survival mode, quite frankly. We're not going through any of that here at Ohio State, and nor do I think that we will. I mean, obviously, we have a new state law where public institutions

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

TED CARTER: So, that means we're going to be transparent and put out everything that we do so that the state of Ohio –

MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.

TED CARTER: The people and the entire country can see it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch to see what happens. Good luck to you, sir.

We'll be right back.

TED CARTER: Thank you.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/changes-federal-student-loans-leave-080000828.html,2025-07-28 08:45:00,Changes to federal student loans leave aspiring medical students scrambling to cover costs,"CHICAGO — Twenty-year-old Eric Mun didn’t want to believe it: Only one kid in the family could make it to medical school — and it wasn’t going to be him.

Mun had done everything right. He graduated high school with honors, earned a scholarship at Northwestern University and breezed through his biology courses.

He immigrated to Alabama from Korea as a toddler. From the quiet stretches of the South, he dreamed of helping patients in a pressed white coat.

But dreams don’t pay tuition. And with new borrowing limits, Mun’s family can only support one child through school.

“My parents already implied that my older brother is probably going to be the one that gets to go,” Mun said.

President Donald Trump’s sweeping “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill, signed into law earlier this month, imposes strict new caps on federal student loans, capping borrowing for professional schools at $50,000 per year. The measure particularly affects medical students, whose tuition often exceeds $300,000 over four years.

Aspiring physicians like Mun have been thrown into financial uncertainty. Many members of the medical community say the measures will send shock waves through a system already laden with economic barriers, discouraging low-income students from pursuing a medical degree.

“It might mean there are people who want to be doctors that can’t be doctors because they can’t afford it,” said Richard Anderson, president of the Illinois State Medical Society.

Before the passage of Trump’s budget bill, the Grad PLUS loan program allowed graduate students to borrow their institution’s total cost of attendance, including living expenses. The program was slashed as part of a broader overhaul to the federal student loan system.

Now, beginning July 1, 2026, most graduate students will be capped at $20,500 in federal loans per year, with a total limit of $100,000. Students in professional schools, like medical, dental or law school, will face the $50,000 annual cap and a total limit of $200,000.

Mun’s parents work at an automobile assembly plant. Throughout high school, he knew he would have to rely on scholarships and federal loans to pay his way through college.

Mun’s voice faltered. “I’m just trying to remain hopeful,” Mun said.

Also folded into the bill: the elimination of several Biden-era repayment plans, cuts to Pell Grants and limits to the Parent PLUS loans program, which allows parents of dependent undergraduates to borrow.

Proponents of the Republican-backed bill said the curbed borrowing will incentivize medical schools and other graduate programs to lower tuition. The tuition of most Chicago-area medical schools is nearly $300,000 for four years, not including cost-of-living expenses.

Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine has a $465,000 price tag after accounting for those indirect costs, according to the school’s website. Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science trails closely behind at nearly $464,000.

“One of the main concerns about the Grad PLUS program is money that is going to subsidize institutions rather than extending access to students,” said Lesley Turner, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

Still, many medical professionals expressed doubt that schools will adjust their costs in response to the bill. Tuition for both private and public schools has been steadily climbing for decades, up 81% from 2001 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.

There’s some evidence that Grad PLUS may have contributed to those tuition hikes. A study co-authored by Turner in 2023 found that prices increased 65 cents per dollar after the program’s introduction in 2006. There was also little indication that Grad PLUS had fulfilled its intended goal of expanding access to underrepresented students.

But Turner cautioned against the abrupt reversal of the program. After accounting for inflation, the lifetime borrowing limits now placed on graduate students are lower than they were in 2005, she said. Many students may turn to private loans to cover the gap, often at higher interest rates.

More than half of medical students relied on Grad PLUS loans, according to AAMC. The median education debt for indebted medical students is around $200,000, with most repayment plans lasting 10 to 20 years. The median stipend for doctors’ first year post-MD was just $65,100 in 2024.

“I think for many reasons, it would have been reasonable to put some sort of limit on Grad PLUS loans, but I think this is a very blunt way of doing it,” Turner said.

In a high-rise on Northwestern’s downtown campus this month, 20 undergraduate students and alums from local colleges gathered for the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative Fellows program. The eight-week summer intensive offers aspiring medical professionals a deep dive into cancer health disparities information and research. Participants like Mun have been left reeling after the flurry of federal cuts.

Alexis Chappel, a 28-year-old graduate of Northeastern Illinois University, watched her dad struggle with addiction growing up. She was deeply moved by the doctors who supported his recovery, and it inspired her to pursue medicine. But she has no idea how she’ll cover tuition.

“I feel like it’s in God’s hands at this point,” Chappel said. “I just felt like it’s a direct attack on Black and brown students who plan on going to medical school.”

Just 10% of medical students are Black and 12% are Latino, according to AAMC enrollment data. Socioeconomic diversity is also limited: A 2018 analysis found that 24% of students came from the wealthiest 5% of U.S. households.

Tricia Pendergrast, who graduated from Feinberg in 2023, relied entirely on Grad PLUS loans to fund her medical education. Juggling classes and clinicals, she had little money saved and no steady stream of income. Pendergrast was so strapped for cash that she enrolled in SNAP benefits — a program also cut under Trump’s budget bill.

Now an anesthesiologist at University of Michigan Health, she’s documented her concerns on TikTok for her 48,000 followers.

“It’s not going to improve representation, and it’s not going to improve access,” Pendergrast said. “It’s going to act as a deterrent for people who otherwise would be excellent physicians.”

For low-income students, the application process is already fraught with economic obstacles, Pendergrast said. Metrics like GPA and the Medical College Admissions Test, or MCAT, are heavily weighted in admissions, and may disadvantage students from underresourced schools. Many students also lack mentorships or networks to guide them through the process, she noted.

“I think the average medical student is going to be richer and whiter, and not from rural areas and not from underserved communities,” Pendergrast said.

The elimination of Grad PLUS loans comes amid a mounting nationwide physician shortage. A recent AAMC report predicted a shortfall of 86,000 physicians by 2036. Meanwhile, a significant portion of the workforce is poised to enter retirement: The U.S. population aged 65 and older is expected to grow 34.1% over the next decade.

The shortage is particularly concentrated in primary care. In practice, that means longer waiting times for patients, and an increased caseload on physicians, who may already suffer from burnout.

“If the goal is truly to make America healthy again, then we need to have a strong physician workforce … We should be coming up with ideas to make it more accessible for people who want to be doctors as opposed to hindering that,” Anderson said.

Sophia Tully, co-president of the Minority Association of Pre-Med Students at Northwestern, said she and her peers have struggled to reconcile with a system that often feels stacked against them. The 21-year-old plans on taking an extra gap year before medical school in an effort to save money.

Tully summed up the environment on campus: “For lack of a better word, people are panicking.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/advocates-energy-auction-shows-data-112019303.html,2025-07-28 11:45:00,"Advocates: Energy auction shows data center influence, grid operator’s deficits","Transmission is just one of the costs going up in ratepayers' monthly bills, along with fuel and capacity charges, that add up to a ""death by a thousand cuts,"" advocates and analysts say. (Photocourtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)

Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause most Marylanders’ monthly electric bills to go up$2 to $5 next summer— but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”

It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Maryland, are out of whack.

The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, said David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.

And ultimately, consumers pay the price.

“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”

At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with abacklogged queuefor energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.

“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.

All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.

This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.

Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) wasbehind a new capon the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D)supportedShapiro’s appeal.

As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”

During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.

But Peltier said that ignores key context.

“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.

When it comes to bill increases from the capacity auction, BGE customers are the exception. The segment of their bills tied to the auction will actuallygo downan estimated $3.36 per month, according to Office of People’s Counsel calculations.

But that’s really only because their rates soared so high after last year’s capacity auction at PJM.

PJM forced a Baltimore-area coal-fired plant, Brandon Shores, and oil-burning plant, H.A. Wagner, to keep running beyond their announced closure dates. But PJM’s rules kept that power out of the 2024 auction, suppressing expected supply at a time of surging demand.

This time, after urging from Lapp’s office and others, the rules were changed so that power from the two older plants was counted. And BGE customers will actually receive a credit for any revenue that the plants’ owner, Talen Energy, receives from the auction, Lapp said, lowering their bills, contrary to initial predictions from PJM.

But their monthly electric bills will still be up $16 from two auctions ago.

In a July 16letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Moore and Shapiro — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.

With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.

It’s fundamentally unfair. Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?

– David Lapp, Maryland Office of People's Counsel

“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.

In a July 18response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.

“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”

He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.

In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”

Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.

“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”

Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.

In a statement Thursday, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV wrote that Moore is “demanding reform and a meaningful voice for states in PJM governance, which is why a bipartisan group of governors’ staff met with PJM members” on Wednesday, including Moore’s staff.

A spokesman for PJM pointed to afact sheetdescribing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.

When she hears ominous predictions for data center demand on the PJM grid, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) is skeptical.

The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region. But it remains an open question how widespread they will become, she said.

“You have the data centers that are sort of playing the field. There’s a real question right now about: Are we overcounting data center load? If the same data center is checking out five different locations, how are we sure?” said Charkoudian, who closely studies energy issues and is frequently behind energy legislation in the General Assembly.

It’s part of the reason she was dismayed to seeMoore vetotwo bills that would have studied energy issues, citing their cost. One bill created a Strategic Energy Planning Office in Maryland, focused on predicting future energy issues without relying on PJM and utility companies; the second studied data centers specifically.

“Right now we’re continually caught flat-footed,” said Charkoudian, who added that she supports veto overrides for those bills.

Lapp said he also worries that data center projections are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.

That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.

“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.

It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.

“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Russia-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy Monday said it has started legal proceedings against Microsoft following the abrupt and unilateral suspension of critical services by the U.S.-headquartered software giant.

""Microsoft is currently restricting Nayara Energy’s access to its own data, proprietary tools, and products—despite these being acquired under fully paid-up licenses,"" the refiner said in a statement.

Nayara, a major buyer of Russian oil, was recently sanctioned by the European Union as the refinery is majority-owned by Russian entities, including oil major Rosneft.

Microsoft last Tuesday halted services for Nayara Energy, sources familiar with the matter said, adding that the company's employees' Outlook email accounts and Teams have not been working.

Microsoft declined to comment on the issue.

Nayara Energy has filed a petition before Delhi High Court seeking an interim injunction and resumption of services to safeguard its rights and ensure continued access to essential digital infrastructure, the company said.

It said Microsoft had not consulted the company before withdrawing the services.

""This action has been taken unilaterally, without prior notice, consultation or recourse, and under the guise of compliance,"" it said.

Since the imposition of EU sanctions against Nayara, at least two tankers skipped loading refined products from Vadinar and one crude tanker carrying Russian Urals was diverted.

Its chief executive resigned and the company had to appoint Sergey Denisov as CEO.

Occasionally, however, there are choices who fall into the you-have-got-to-be-kidding-me category.

Take Darren Beattie, for example.The Associated Press reported:

A senior State Department official who was fired as a speechwriter during President Donald Trump ‘s first term and has a history of incendiary statements has been appointed to lead the embattled U.S. Institute of Peace. The move to install Darren Beattie as the institute’s new acting president is seen as the latest step in the administration’s efforts to dismantle the embattled organization. ... The State Department confirmed the appointment in a statement to the Associated Press on Saturday.

This will not be his only job: According to the State Department’s website, Beattie will alsocontinue to be responsible forleading “public diplomacy outreach, which includes messaging to counter terrorism and violent extremism” at the agency.

In case anyone needsa refresher, it was in 2018 — the second year of the president’s first term — when officials in the Trump White House started receiving media calls about Beattie, who was a speechwriter and policy aide at the time. Journalists wanted to know whether Beattie’s colleagues were aware of his roleat a conference regularly attended by well-known white nationalists.

Soon after,he was fired.

Eight years later, however, Donald Trump’s standards have evolved; his tolerance for hiring extremists is worse; andBeattie returnedto a position of influence: Just two weeks after the president’s second inaugural, Beattie was hired to serve as the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy.NBC News reportedin early February:

Beattie has a history of making inflammatory remarks, including a post on X in October that said: ‘Competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work. Unfortunately, our entire national ideology is predicated on coddling the feelings of women and minorities, and demoralizing competent white men.’ Beattie’s site promoted a baseless theory that the attack on the Capitol was the handiwork of the FBI, or has he put it, a ‘Fedsurrection.’

Unfortunately, the list doesn’t end there. Beattie also spent part of Jan. 6, 2021,telling various Black people— including Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina — to “learn their place” and “take a knee to MAGA.”

CNN hada related reporton Beattie’s record, noting that he also praised Dr. James Watson, the founder of modern genetics who later suggested Black people were less intelligent than White people, as the “greatest living American scientist.” Similarly, in 2020, Beattie wrote online, “‘S---hole countries’ was the high-point of Trump’s presidency,” referring toa notoriously racist incident from Trump’s first term.

What's more, as recently as last year, Beattievoiced supportfor mass sterilization of “low-IQ trash,” complaining, “Higher quality humans are subsidizing the fertility of lower quality humans.”

For good measure, let’s also not forget that Beattie alsopublished since-deleted tweetsabout Secretary of State Marco Rubio — his current boss — having a “low I.Q.” and possibly being gay.

Common sense might suggest that revelations like these would bring Beattie’s State Department tenure to an abrupt end. Instead, he’s received a promotion.

It’s a reminder, not only of how much worse the second Trump administration is from the first, but also of the White House’s determination to crush the U.S. Institute of Peace, while signaling to the public that the president doesn’t much mind rewarding those on his team with racist records.

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth's newly returned CEO, Stephen Hemsley, will likely face investor scrutiny over the largest U.S. health insurance and services company's efforts to rein in the elevated medical costs behind the withdrawal of its annual forecast.

Hemsley returned to the role in May following the abrupt departure of then-CEO Andrew Witty, who stepped down amid rising operational and financial pressures.

The company's decision in May to withdraw its 2025 earnings forecast due to soaring medical costs and Medicare-related challenges sent its shares tumbling.

So far this year, UnitedHealth's stock has plunged more than 40%, dragging down the broader managed care sector with it.

""Investors will be looking for confidence that he (Hemsley) has got a handle on things and that he understands where things may have gone wrong and how they are going to correct it,"" said James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management, which owns 46,333 shares of the healthcare company.

Hemsley, who ran the company from 2006 to 2017, has promised to rebuild trust, telling shareholders last month that regaining their confidence is a top priority.

The pressure is compounded by a federal investigation into UnitedHealth's Medicare billing practices. The company recently confirmed it was cooperating with both criminal and civil inquiries from the U.S. Department of Justice. These regulatory woes have only added to the uncertainty facing the insurer.

Wall Street analysts have lowered expectations throughout this month. Analysts expect a profit of $4.48 per share for the second quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG. That compares with expectations of $5.70 per share in May, when the company suspended its annual profit forecast.

UnitedHealth plans to establish ""a prudent 2025 earnings outlook and offer initial perspectives for 2026,"" the company had said in June.

""Ultimately, on Tuesday, what we'd expect is more clarity on the way forward...we would expect a strategy, a roadmap laid out,"" said Sahil Bhatia, managing director of life sciences at Manning & Napier.

""I think one of the big issues over the last few months has been just the surprises...so we would expect more consistent execution going forward after laying out that roadmap,"" Bhatia said.

At least two investors said they anticipate UnitedHealth will reset its 2025 profit forecast in the range of $18 to $20 per share, far below the company's previous outlook of $26 to $26.50.

This might be conservative but is an appropriate start for Hemsley's first call, said Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.

UnitedHealth has previously built a reputation to guide conservatively and raise its outlook as the year progresses.

But this time, investors warn, withholding guidance altogether would be damaging. ""If they continue to not give an EPS outlook for 2025, that will be damaging,"" Harlow added.

Apart from financial turbulence, the company has also faced reputational challenges. It has moved to ease prior authorization requirements after a public outcry following the killing of a UnitedHealth executive last December.

The Optum unit, once a growth driver for UnitedHealth, has also emerged as a key area of concern. Last quarter, the company flagged ""unanticipated changes"" in its Optum business that impacted planned 2025 reimbursements.

""Among all the overhangs, Optum Health remains the biggest concern,"" said Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill.

UnitedHealth has also grappled with the fallout from a major cyberattack last year that disrupted claims processing across its Change Healthcare unit.

On April 29, 1999,precision-guided NATO bombs tore through the brick facades of two defense-ministry buildings in Belgrade, the capital of the rump state of Yugoslavia. The targets were chosen more for symbolic reasons than operational ones: The American-led coalition wanted to send the country’s authoritarian government, at that time engaged in a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, a clear message that human rights weren’t just words. They were backed by weapons.

For decades, the ruins of the buildings, on either side of a major artery through central Belgrade, were left largely untouched. Tangled concrete and twisted rebar stuck out of pancaked floors. Serbian architects fought to preserve the destroyed buildings; the government has treated them as a war memorial.

At the time of the 1999 NATO bombings, Aleksandar Vučić, Serbia’s minister of information, was tasked with denouncing the West and backing his country’s despot, Slobodan Milošević. Today, Vučić has risen in the ranks to become Serbia’s president—an apologist for Russia who attacks the press, has beenaccused of nurturing close ties to organized crime, and israpidly dragging his country toward authoritarianism.

Vučić is not Milošević—he has not led his country into genocidal wars or faced judgment for war crimes at The Hague—but until recently, he might have expected that his authoritarian style would make relations with Washington rocky. That time is past. Instead of harshly condemning Serbia’s abuses, America’s president, Donald Trump, will build a Trump Tower Belgrade on top of the defense buildings’ ruins. “Belgrade welcomesa Global Icon,” theslick website for Trump Belgradeproclaims. “TRUMP. UnrivaledLuxury.” The contract for the project has beensigned with Affinity Partners, Jared Kushner’s investment firm, which is largely funded with billions of dollars incash from Saudi Arabia.

[Read: The US is switching sides]

This story is the material expression of the second Trump administration’s turn against a long-standing tradition of Western democracy promotion—and of an embrace of conflicts of interest from which the world’s despots can only take inspiration. The authoritarians who govern small countries such as Serbia no longer need to fear the condemnation, much less the bombs, of the American president when they crack down on their opponents, enrich themselves, or tighten their grip on power. On the contrary—the American flirtation with similar practices emboldens them. With Trump’s unapologetic foreign policy in his second term, American democracy promotion is effectively dead.

Prior tothe Soviet Union’s collapse, Western diplomats cared far more about whether a dictator was an ally or adversary to the Soviets than about the quality of a country’s elections or its respect for human rights. If diplomats from Washington or London pushed too hard for democracy, there was a credible risk that a Western ally could defect and become a friend to Moscow. Once the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the world’s despots no longer had so much cover; Western diplomats could now push harder. New norms developed, which led to arapid surge in the number of competitive, multiparty elections. Human rights were no longer just an aspirational buzzword. Some countries lost foreign aid or were shunned by the international community if their government committed atrocities.

This pressure to adopt democracy and protect human rights was never applied equally. Powerful countries, such as a rising China, became largely immune to Western cajoling. And strategically important countries, such as Saudi Arabia, in many cases got a free pass, facing little more than rhetorical condemnation while presidents and prime ministers continued to shake hands and ink major arms deals. Meanwhile, in smaller countries, such as Togo, Madagascar, or the former Yugoslavia, the post–Cold War push for democracy and human rights often came not just with lip service, but also with teeth. After all, the White House could afford to lose the goodwill of Madagascar in a dispute over values; its geopolitical priorities would suffer little downside. Moreover, weak countries such as Madagascar depended on foreign aid, such that Western governments wielded far more leverage in them than they did in larger, more self-sufficient countries. For a while, then, small-time despots faced a credible threat: Go too far, rights defenders could hope to warn strongmen, and a Western ambassador could soon be knocking on the palace door.

None of this is to say that Western powers were always on the side of the angels. During the Cold War, Western governments made lofty speeches about democracy and human rights while funding coups and arming politically convenient rebels. The CIA played a role in overthrowing popularly legitimate governments, such as those of Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran, Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, and Salvador Allende in Chile. Even after the Cold War, Western governments have cozied up to plenty of friendly dictatorships, in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Equatorial Guinea.

And yet, particularly in the last 30 years, Western pressure and foreign aid have been significant forces for global democratization. Dictators and despots knew that the world was paying attention, which gave them pause before they turned their guns on their own people. Foreign aid became tied to the verdicts of election monitors, which drastically expanded operations after the end of the Cold War. With funding from the United States and other Western governments, opposition parties, journalists, and civil-society organizations received training on how to bolster democracy. And when political transitions toward democracy took place, as in Tunisia after the Arab Spring, billions of dollars in support flowed in. Partly because of these shifting international norms, the expansion of political freedom was so abrupt after the end of the Cold War that many believed democracy, having won the ideological battle against rival models of governance such as fascism and communism, had become an inexorable force.

But the democracy boom under Bill Clinton gave way to failed wars under George W. Bush and inaction under Barack Obama. Bush, who justified wars in Afghanistan and Iraq partly under the guise of a democracy-and-freedom agenda, inadvertently discredited the notion of values-based “nation building.” A widespread perception among American adversaries took root thatdemocracy promotionwas just a code word for “regime change carried out by American troops.” This gave dictators political cover to boot out international NGOs hoping to bolster democracy and human rights, branding them as mere precursors for a heavy-handed invasion. Obama, picking up the pieces of that failed foreign policy, downplayed the grand vision of a more democratic world as a guiding principle of American diplomacy, even as countries across the globe began to pivot toward authoritarian rule.

Now the world is steadily becoming less democratic. According to data from Freedom House, the world has become more authoritarian every year since 2006. Trump’s second term may provide the most potent autocratic accelerant yet. In his first term, Trump routinely praised dictators, including in a memorable moment when he boasted about exchanging “beautiful letters” with North Korea’s tyrant. President Joe Biden, with his much-touted Summit for Democracy, tried to recenter democracy as a core principle of the State Department, but that effort was overtaken by successive geopolitical emergencies in Ukraine and Gaza. Now, with his return to power, Trump has gone further than before to fully uproot democracy promotion from American foreign policy.

The list of dismantled initiatives is long. In the first months of the second Trump administration, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency not only slashed America’s foreign-aid machinery, effectively destroying USAID, but also targeted the National Endowment for Democracy: abipartisan grant-making organization established under Ronald Reaganto strengthen democratic values abroad. The Trump administration haseffectively kneecappedVoice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, outlets that have aimed to provide news and information to those living under oppressive regimes. Once viewed as bulwarks against authoritarian censorship, these platforms are now overseen by Trump acolyte Kari Lake. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently announced an overhaul of the State Department thateffectively eliminates programsthat work toward peace building and democracy.

As an extra gift to the world’s despots, on July 16, Rubio signaled that America will no longer stand in the way of election rigging: Washington willcondemnautocratswho use sham election-style events to stay in power only if a major American foreign-policy interest is at stake, the secretary made clear, and from now on, American comments on foreign elections will be “brief, focused on congratulating the winning candidate and, when appropriate, noting shared foreign policy interests.”

The world’s worst dictators can rest assured that the next American diplomat to come knocking on their palace doors is more likely to be looking for property rights than human rights. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, which always have had a free pass, might not notice the difference. But brutal regimes in less-noticed parts of the world have now gotten the memo that the Trump White House is indifferent to democracy and human rights, and they are acting accordingly. Cambodia hascracked down onjournalists while courting American military officials. Tanzania’s leader recentlyarrested his main rival and charged him with treason. Indonesia’s president has begunchanging laws, militarizing the country, and undermining the principle of civilian rule. Nigeria’s president made apower grabthat critics say was blatantly illegal. And El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who had faced international criticisms for egregious human-rights abuses, isn’t just absolved from American pressure—he’s become a much-celebrated friend of the White House, laudedbecauseof his gulags.

Already, in regions such as Southeast Asia, brave pro-democracy reformers find themselves newly vulnerable and isolated. In Myanmar, pro-democracy forces fighting the country’s military dictatorship long benefited from American aid.The DOGE cutsput an end to that—and gave the repressive junta an enormous boost. In Thailand, a human-rights organization that once sheltered dissidents fleeing Cambodia and Laos has been forced to close its safehouses, allowing those regimes to more easily hunt down and even kill their opponents. These funding streams had accounted for a tiny proportion of the U.S. government’s budget, but their elimination sends a strong signal to the world’s autocrats: that virtually no one will now interfere with their designs.

Admittedly, the United States is less powerful than it once was, and other countries have always had their own domestic agendas, regardless of what Washington has said or done. But that a growing number of the world’s despots no longer have to weigh economic costs or diplomatic consequences for crushing their opponents has already made a difference. Thomas Carothers and Oliver Stuenkel of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peacehighlightedthe fact that shortly after Musk referred to USAID as a “criminal organization,” autocrats in Hungary, Serbia, and Slovakia began targeting pro-democracy NGOs that had received money from the agency.

President Reaganonce celebratedthe United States as a “shining city on a hill,” a “beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.” That is apparently no longer the aspiration of the American government, which now sends its foreign pilgrims to a dehumanizing prison in El Salvador, arrests judges, and suggests that following the country’s Constitution may be optional.

For democracy to flourish, citizens must yearn for it—and demand it of their governments. At the moment, few can be looking with admiration to the United States as a model. Already in 2024, according to a 34-country survey conducted by Pew Research, the most common perception of American democracy was that the United States “used to be a good example, but has not been in recent years.” The first months of the second Trump administration can hardly have improved that impression.

Nonetheless, democracy—which provides citizens with a meaningful say over how their lives are governed—still has mass appeal across the globe. Brave, principled activists continue to stand up to despots, even though they do so at much greater peril today than even just a few months ago.

In Serbia, for example, pro-democracy, anti-corruption protestshave persisted for months. Students and workersare demandingimmediate reforms and calling on Vučić to resign. In years past, precisely this kind of movement would have provoked White House press releases, diplomatic visits, and barbed statements from the Oval Office. In April, at long last, came a high-profile visit to Serbia from someone closely linked to the Trump administration. But instead of offering support for the pro-democracy demonstrators, this American emissary condemned the protests and implied that they were the sinister work of American left-wingers and USAID.

That visitor was none other than Donald Trump Jr., who had arrived in Belgrade to fawn over Vučić in an exclusive interview for hisTriggered with Don Jr.podcast, in the months before the newest Trump Tower opens for presales.

The actress, 24, has broken her silence after abruptly bringing her “Evita” performance to a grinding halt last week over a mystery illness.

Zegler took to social media Saturday to thank the cast and crew of the London-based theater production after she waswasn’t able to return to the stage for Act 2on Thursday.

The “Snow White” star shared a photo of herself onstageat the London Palladiumon the West End on her Instagram Story.

“Cannot describe the love in this building every night, but today in particular,” Zegler wrote to her 2.5 million followers on the platform.

“I am in awe of this company. The way they come together and never leave anyone behind.”

Zegler praised the cast’s response to her abrupt timeout, saying they “truly hold each other’s hands throughout each number, act and show.”

“The result speaks for itself. Well done swing nation,” she went on, using the industry term for understudies. “Today … my heart literally overflows for you all.”

Bella Brown, Zegler’s understudy, took over during the musical’s second act and performed the production’s signature song, “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina.”

The audience was so pleased with Brown’s performance that they gave the young starlet analmost-five-minute standing ovation.

“Today really showed just how important swings and covers are within this industry,” Brown wrote after the performance. “They are pillars of a show! A proud day to be at ‘Evita.’”

“What a lucky audience getting to see both me and MY ANGEL REG ZEG!”

Zegler stars as the former first lady of Argentina, Eva Perón, in director Jamie Lloyd’s revival of the Andrew Lloyd Webber classic.

The production, which kicked off in June and is scheduled to run through September, marks Zegler’s London stage debut."

However, it was insider Shari Redstone who completed the dreaded desecration last week.

Surelythe capitulation to President Trump by Redstone, controlling owner of Paramount-CBS, to secure Federal Communications Commission clearance to sell her dwindling media empire to David Ellison of Skydance and Redbird Capital was a moment of tragic irony. Wehad saluted the board battlesof Redstone, the seemingly underrated, high-integrity daughter of owner Sumner Redstone, inher difficult governance battleswith theCEOs of Viacom and CBS, expecting that she would return the media powerhouses to their strategic positioning as engines of innovation. Sadly, they only atrophied further, consumed by internal reshuffling and missed opportunities for timely investments in programming and technologies.

As prominent media commentators suchas Oliver Darcyand Matt Belloni pointout, thepayment of $16 millionto the Trump Presidential Library from CBS News’s60 Minutesoverthe objections of its executive producer(who resigned in protest) resembled payment of an extortion-like penalty to the government for the standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last summer.

Of course, Trump’sclaims of “damage”ring especially hollow given not only that the transcript showednothing irregularabout the edits but also, of course, the fact he won the election. This happened just weeks after the final performance of George Clooney’s Broadway blockbusterGood Night and Good Luck,a tribute to the bold, legendary head of CBS News, Edward R. Murrow, and his team of noble journalists. This was followed by the cancellation of “King of Comedy” Stephen Colbert’s revered late show, seemingly over its satirical criticism of the Trump administration. The explanation thatthe show was too expensive and lost moneyraised many eyebrows, particularly given the lack of attempts to trim the 200-person production staff to bring it in line before its abrupt cancellation on the eve of Trump’s FCC merger approval.

But Paramount’s woes extend much deeper than a few rough weeks. Sadly, this media enterprise had stopped innovating for decades, despite the fast-moving programming and technologies of the strategic context of news and entertainment, on top of its own legendary history of innovation.

The venerable media brands of CBS, Paramount, and Viacom shared a history as pioneering entrepreneurs that actually wandered into each other’s paths repeatedly. They also shared histories of early innovation followed by decades of palace intrigue, succession battles, organizational churning, and strategic atrophy.

CBS was founded in 1927 as a radio network by a talent agent, Arthur Judson. A year later, William Paley acquired 51 percent of the network, while Paramount Pictures bought 49 percent. In the Depression, Paramount was forced to sell its stake to emerge from bankruptcy. Under Paley, CBS became known as “the Tiffany network,” given its high-quality programming, expanding into television in the 1940s; its news division, under Edward R. Murrow, became the gold standard of broadcast journalism. It spun out its syndication business, known as Viacom, in 1971. Paley had undermined a series of four highly regarded successors with sequential palace coups over 60 years, until the board finally removed him and sold the business to the Tisch family’s Loews firm, which later sold it to Westinghouse, which in turn sold it to Sumner Redstone.

Paramount was founded in 1912 by Hungarian immigrantAdolph Zukor, an investor in the older media sector of the nickelodeon, the first form of indoor exhibition space dedicated to showing projectedmotion picturesthrough individual machines. As large-screen technology developed, Zukor launched a chain of palatial theaters to distribute the films his studio produced. He also created the star system, which featured performers such as Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, W.C. Fields, Cary Grant, and the Marx Brothers. Paramount produced many great classic films, such as the Godfather movies,Psycho,Chinatown, andThe Ten Commandments. Zukor pioneered many of the first animated cartoons, sound films (“talkies”), and musical films, and was an early investor in Bill Paley’s CBS broadcasting network; however, he surrendered that stake as part of Paramount’s bankruptcy reorganization during the Depression.

Meanwhile, NBC was created by David Sarnoff, a Russian immigrant and brilliant innovator, as a division of the Radio Corporation of America, or RCA, which he created in partnership with General Electric and Westinghouse in 1921. GE and Westinghouse were forced to divest their stakes due to antitrust concerns in 1932. At the 1939 New York World’s Fair, Sarnoff unveiled the first electronic black and white television and, later, in 1954, the first color television.

In 1948, the Supreme Court forced thedivestitureof Paramount Studios from Paramount Theaters, separating production from exhibition. Leonard Goldenson, an antitrust attorney, bought the theater chain and merged it with ABC, which had been created in the court-ordered divestiture of one of NBC’s two networks. Paramount Studios became a major source of ABC TV shows. Paramount also opened a chain of amusement parks around the nation.

Gulf & Western, a large industrial conglomerate that manufactured automotive parts and purchased Paramount, was then led by Barry Diller and Michael Eisner, who produced many of the definitive box office hits of the late 1970 and 1980s, such asAirplane!,Ordinary People,Terms of Endearment, and theIndiana Jonesfranchise. Diller left to create Fox Television, while Eisner left to save Disney.

In the 1990s, Sumner Redstone’s Viacom, which had been CBS television’s syndication business, took control of Paramount and then merged back with CBS in 2000 but later spun out CBS in 2005, only to push to reunite them a decade later. In May 2016, the fast-fading 93-year-old Sumner Redstone removed Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and George Abrams, a longtime Viacom board member, as members of his trust, which controls Redstone’s ownership of National Amusements, which, in turn, controls 80 percent of Viacom and CBS.

Dauman and Abrams expressed shock and outrage at the decision, but many wondered what took so long, given Dauman’s faltering performance. At that time, Dauman was one of the highest-paid CEOs in the nation (earning $85 million a year between 2011 and 2015), but Viacom’s stock price was down by 50 percent over the year, with the once-mighty cable channels of MTV and VH1 having gone creatively stale and the legendary Paramount studios all but moribund as Redstone, like Paley, churned through four highly regarded expected successors, staying in power into his nineties.

Since Sumner Redstone began the processof handing over control to Shari in 2016, Paramount stock has nosedived 75 percent, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in value and shrinking to a valuation of merely $8 billion, a fraction of the roughly $80 billion it was worth when Sumner was at his peak in 2001.

That value decline has been a long time coming, as media peers soared past the once-thriving Viacom and CBS empires, which had rotted from within, lethargic and seemingly watching as the world passed them by. Remarkably, in stark contrast to its peers, the company did not make a single major acquisition or enter a new business line over the last two decades.

Over the same period, Disney-ABC and Comcast-NBC brilliantly reinvented themselves with far better entertainment products, expanded highly profitable theme park investments with amusements showcasing films and TV shows, enhanced sports programming, and fortified respected news coverage. Disney, under its revered CEO Bob Iger, hasundergone several transformations. Its film franchises (The Avengers, the Frozen movies, andBlack Panther) consistently enjoyed widespread critical acclaim and set box office records. Wisely, Iger purchased Pixar for $7.4 billion, from which Disney has reaped over $40 billion. The subsequent $4 billion acquisition of Marvel has netted Disney $13 billion, followed by the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm, which has generated $12 billion.

Similarly, Comcast has captured a significant share of the media market following its complete acquisition of NBCUniversal for $39 billion in 2013, with continued innovation. Comcast-NBCUniversal has churned out hit after hit in its content—The Office,30 Rock, the One Chicago and Law & Order franchises. Moreover, Universal Pictures, the studio unit, had huge blockbusters such asOppenheimerandWicked. Its Peacock streaming business has delivered $4.9 billion in revenue last year with 46 percent annual growth.

All Paramount seems to have accomplished in those years was the fruitless meiosis and mitosis of Viacom, CBS, and Paramount being constantly stapled together and torn apart, only to be pasted together again. Such waves of unification and dissolution were distractions from creative risk taking and business building, as they hindered the adoption of new technologies and the discovery of adjacent entertainment properties. The repeat business marriages and divorces mirrored the head-spinning matrimonial volatility of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.

The revival of NBC and ABC is proof that old brands can be either wasted or revitalized. Humorist Fred Allen, an old CBS radio star from back in the golden age, once complained that “imitation is the highest form … of television.” Had CBS only copied its peers, it would have been in far better shape.

In fairness, Skydance is buying not just venerable old brand names but undervalued current properties. Amazingly, CBS is hitting a record seventeenth consecutive season as themost watched network, with the top seven prime-time shows, not to mention streaming hits such as Paramount’sYellowstone.Thus Skydance is getting a bargain that Redstone is handing off wrongly at distress prices.

With deal closure expected next week, the new Paramount-CBS will be 70 percent owned by Skydance Media and 30 percent by public owners. And what is Skydance? It was founded in 2006 by CEO David Ellison, a former actor, who is expected to become chairman-CEO of the new combined entity. He’s the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a Trump supporter and thesecond-wealthiest personin the world with $280 billion.

David Ellison was backing Joe Biden—he gave Bidennearly a million dollarsin April 2024 before Biden dropped out. Nonetheless, media experts were concerned by the exits of such respected leaders as CBS News chiefWendy McMahonand60 Minutesexecutive producerBill Owens, who resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The apparent courtship of the divisive journalist and Free Press founder Bari Weiss has also raised eyebrows about a prospective fusing of Free Press with CBS News. On the other hand, the new appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens at the helm of60 Minuteswas received as anencouraging move.

Yet still, key news leadership changes on top of the shameful shakedown of60 Minutesand the politically driven cancellation of the hugely popular Colbert show, are beyond troubling. Ominously, according to reports, Paramount also surrendered to the hiring of an ombudsman at CBS News to be charged with investigating complaints of political bias, with the concession made in a letter to the FCC that “in all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS’s reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based.”

Such tragic capitulation of First Amendment rights, accompanied by a demoralizing and brand-tarnishing political appeasement, followed decades of self-destructive value erosion. The turbulence of these last few weeks for Paramount seems a fitting capstone for Shari Redstone’s turbulent run at the helm of this storied but struggling company. Our private independent media enterprises are public treasures. They must not become state propaganda outlets. As CBS News titan Edward R. Murrow warned, 65 years ago: “To be persuasive, we must be believable. To be believable, we must be credible. To be credible, we must be truthful.… A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.”"

Rochelle Searight explained on TikTok why so many wives and girlfriends (WAGs) of NFL players are ""freaking out"" on social media about the start of training camp

The San Francisco 49ers WAG, who's married to wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, cited several challenges football partners face that may not be known to the public from the outside

Searight used a few examples of her own, now that her husband is entering his sixth year in the NFL

Ready, set... training camp!

Rochelle Searight, wife of Brandon Aiyuk of the San Francisco 49ers, broke down onTikTokwhy so manywives and girlfriends (WAGs) of NFL playersare in a ""panic"" now that football training camp has commenced ahead of the season's start.

“Why do all the wives and girlfriends [of NFL players] go into a frenzy when their men report for training camp?"" she began the clip posted on Wednesday, July 23. ""Why is everybody online complaining?""

""Let me give y’all some of these details on training camp and why everybody’s in a panic,” she continued, before citing a few examples from her own experiences having been with an NFL player since at least November 2018, per herInstagram.

Rochelle Searight/instagram

Searight noted that her husband, whom she wed in April this year, is entering his sixth year in the NFL. Despite their familiarity with training camp, she said, ""every single season has looked different"" due to various factors.

""They have to report to work and they have to sleep in their hotel, they have a curfew, and if they leave, they get a huge fine. It’s crazy,"" she shared.

“Training camp does last for multiple weeks and the women freak out because — so in my situation, I’m a mother. Now he has to abruptly leave, and [I’m] taking care of my rambunctious four-year-old by myself, who has never slept, and he is off the walls,"" she explained.

Searight then explained the difficulties that have to do with housing, pointing out how some WAGs aren't located in the same areas as their NFL partner's team, which can make relationships a challenge.

Rochelle Searight/instagram

""For some other people’s situations, they’re not based in the same city that the team plays… and they stay in the Bay just during the season,"" she shared. “The wives and girlfriends who are back home now have to get left and [their significant other] have to go report to work, go to camp.""

While Searight says she gets to see her husband ""every few days,"" she notes how others ""don't get to see their man at all for like weeks.""

The 49ers WAG also emphasized the intensity and instability of minicamp, adding increased pressures and stresses for the couple if it doesn't go as planned.

Rochelle Searight/instagram

""Minicamp is so intense,"" she says. ""Some of the men are not guaranteed a spot yet, they are fighting for their spot on the team. So if they don’t make this team and they end up on a different team, the family has to pack up and move. It’s just a lot.""

Searight said so many WAGs are turning to social media to cope with the stressful period.

""Abrupt training camp change is no joke, so that's why you’ll see all of the girlies going crazy online and then social media is a fun way to just distract from that time,"" she explained. ""So no, our men aren’t our whole personality people. It just gives us a fun thing to look forward to. It’s just content.""

In her TikTok caption, Searight hilariously compared the events that take place during ""NFL WAG season"" to a hit reality show.

""After ‘Love Island’ comes NFL Wag season. Beware y’all, we’re back. Try not to cringe,"" she wrote.

The NFL couple have been dating since they were teenagers, having reportedly first met when Aiyuk was attending college at Arizona State University. When he was drafted to the 49ers in 2020, the pair packed their bags and headed to California's Bay Area.

The couple also welcomed their son the same year.

Last week, theNational Bureau of Economic Research announcedthat its Retirement and Disability Research Center would be closing due to cuts to research funding provided by the SSA. The center was part of a six-member consortium that received funding from the administration to support research on retirement, disability and Social Security.

READ MORE:How to fix Social Security's pending shortfall, according to advisors

In February, the SSA announced plans to terminate roughly $15 million in funding for the Retirement and Disability Research Consortium.

""Terminating our RDRC cooperative agreements aligns with President Trump's priorities to end fraudulent and wasteful initiatives and contracts,"" said Lee Dudek, who was serving as Social Security's acting commissioner at the time. ""We will continue to root out waste and abuse to earn back America's trust and confidence in our agency.""

The RDRC was established by the agency in 2018, with current funding agreements planned to last until the 2028 fiscal year.

Along with the National Bureau of Economic Research, retirement research centers at the City University of New York (CUNY) Baruch College and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County have also closed in recent months due to the elimination of federal funding.

The Retirement and Disability Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is also in the process of shutting down, with plans to officially close around Aug. 1, according to J. Michael Collins, faculty director at the UW-Madison Retirement and Disability Research Center.

The University of Michigan's Retirement and Disability Research Center also appears to have shut down, with no new research posted to its website and its social media accounts either deleted or dormant. The university did not respond to a request for confirmation.

Out of the six consortium members, only the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College remains open. Private funding has allowed the center to continue its core research efforts, but training and grants have been eliminated due to the termination of federal funding, according to Andrew Eschtruth, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

Researchers say these closures are likely to have long-term consequences for public policy decision-making.

Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School and a former co-director of the New York Retirement & Disability Research Center, said that the SSA's funding cuts mark a shift away from the evidence-based policy making that has defined the government's approach for more than 100 years.

""That's the way retirement and Social Security programs have really operated, like the congressional leaders that move Social Security forward, and even presidents, really, rely on the facts on the ground to figure out the trade-offs they're making,"" Ghilarducci said.

Eschtruth shared a similar perspective.

""It's part of a broader change in direction by the federal government to reduce public support of research, which could reduce the information available to help public policy decision-making in a variety of areas,"" he said.

Across all six research centers, faculty say that the abrupt elimination of federal funding led to dozens of training programs and research efforts being cut short with nothing to show for the money already spent.

At Boston College, training and education programs were pulled back, and research grants to junior faculty and Ph.D. candidates were eliminated due to funding cuts. Ten ongoing research projects funded through these grants were left incomplete, Eschtruth said.

One project explored a potential cost-saving strategy for the Social Security Administration: using local volunteers to assist beneficiaries — a model that has shown success in Medicare. Another project was researching the impact of Social Security caregiver credits, particularly for people who stay home to take care of young children, on labor force participation.

At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two large training programs and 19 research projects were eliminated due to the funding cuts. Several projects focused on ABLE accounts, which are tax-advantaged savings and investment accounts for individuals with disabilities. These accounts allow eligible users to save money without affecting their access to public benefits such as Medicaid, SSI or SSDI.

""We understand that funding priorities change, but there's a way to do this that would allow us to at least complete the projects that were started,"" Collins said. ""And it actually wouldn't have cost any more money because we still had startup costs that were already charged, right? So we could have actually produced 19 different research papers this year.""

Prior to the funding termination in February, Ghilarducci said that she and other researchers were told to stop all DEI-related research grants. For the New York Retirement & Disability Research Center, that meant stopping one LGBTQ-focused research project.

""And then we actually looked at all of our websites and the language that we use to describe the grant, and we changed that language to meet the new administration's [requirements],"" Ghilarducci said. ""And it wasn't hard. I mean, we did cut out all the DEI research, but all the other research just had to do with long-term care, insurance, disabled workers, disability benefits, kind of quotidian things that you know, that affect everybody.""

Researchers say the Social Security Administration's outright termination of research funding in February went beyond efforts to eliminate DEI research.

""We just felt like that wasn't a fair assessment of what the work was, and certainly they could look project by project and say, 'This project's not a priority, that project's not a priority,' but to just terminate everything across all six centers all at once and not allow any researchers to move forward, I think it was a wasted opportunity,"" Collins said."

“You’re next,” she told Ivelisse Gonzalez, according to Gonzalez. “She saw the envelope with my name on it that contained my termination letter sitting on the desk of the executive director.

Perez was right. Several minutes later, Gonzalez was summoned to the executive suite and informed she was out of work.

Her termination letter cited a review of her computer hard drive, which uncovered a “political file” and several things “unrelated to your job,” the letter, a copy of which was provided to The Republican, reads.

“I don’t even know what I did, or what I’m being accused of,” Gonzalez said during an interview Monday — two days after members broke the news that Perez had been fired. “They told me to look at page 16 of the employee handbook that covers ethical violations.”

The letter was signed by Maria Ligus, executive director of the nonprofit, which serves the poor, particularly in the heavily Latino North End.

“NNCC prohibits individualized partisan political activities inside our facilities during working hours by employees, consultants, volunteers and paid staff,” the letter read, in part.

Perez and Gonzalez’s firings come as a political contest nears. Sitting on the board of directors of the council is Perez’s opponent in the coming City Council race, Joesiah Gonzalez, a School Committee member who in January announced he planned to challenge his mentor in the election.

Joesiah Gonzalez gave a brief statement to a reporter Sunday. “I’ll pray for Maria and her family,” he said, adding that he was speaking as an elected official and a candidate, not as a board member.

Ligus could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon.

When interviewed Sunday, board Secretary Efrain “Jesse” Vazquez Jr. was quick to point out that the board only oversees Ligus and that the executive director manages all other employees. The board nonetheless came out with a statement Saturday night, vaguely referencing “embezzlement,” which is not consistent with language in Perez’s termination letter.

Perez was adamant in an interview Monday that the accusation is false.

“I have never stolen a dime from that board, or our community,” Perez said. “I have devoted my life to that job and my community.

She repeatedly referred to “backroom politics.”

On Monday, state Sen. Carlos Gonzalez said he has known Perez for years and had “witnessed her steadfast commitment to advocating for the rights of underprivileged communities, especially in the North End. Throughout this time, I have always witnessed her to consistently upheld ethical standards.”

The lawmaker said that while he did not have all the details regarding the council’s decision to fire Perez, he said she should have been given any “appropriate warnings about any behaviors that could jeopardize her long and commendable career.”

Perez was groomed for her former job as director of housing, overseeing programs whose mission was to help people diagnosed with AIDS find homes, along with assisting members of other marginalized groups. Ivelisse Gonzalez became a housing specialist upon her hire in 2023.

Perez, meanwhile, had been working at the council for 43 years. In the earliest years, she worked for Barbara Rivera, among the founders of the North End community group.

According to financial statements the New North Citizens Council filed with the state in 2024, the agency operated on a yearly budget of roughly $11 million, with nearly all of its operating funds coming from grants and contributions, with the main source being the state and federal government.

Springfield’s housing director, Gerry McCafferty, said Monday that a 2024 review of Perez’s housing programs yielded no negative findings.

A Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS grant was provided to the agency worth $218,135 and supplemented with nearly $38,000 in funds the council had left over from the previous years.

The council also received $138,297 in an Emergency Services grant, which was to be spent over two years. Both amounts were Housing and Urban Development grants administered by the city, according to McCafferty and documents.

“We perform annual monitoring visits for the (two) grants, in which we do an on-site visit and audit a selection of program and financial files. There were no findings in their most recent monitoring, which took place in spring 2024,” McCafferty said.

Perez’s firing was announced in a letter from the New North Citizens Council board of directors and released on Saturday night. It was signed by Vazquez, the board clerk.

In it, the board said it had contacted the “Attorney General’s Ethics Commission” about Perez.

The Ethics Commission cannot confirm or deny any investigation due to a state statute, spokesman Gerry Tuoti said Monday.

A spokesperson for the state Attorney General’s office said no complaint was before that office and they have no association with the Ethics Commission.

Gonzalez, the state senator, said he respects the council board and executive director.

“I hope moving forward, on behalf of the community, all parties can engage in dialogue, avoiding emotions and innuendo that would harm individuals’ reputations,” Gonzalez said.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy.)

Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause monthly electric bills to go up$2 to $5 next summer— but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”

It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Kentucky, are out of whack.

The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers in that state. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.

And ultimately, consumers pay the price.

“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”

At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with abacklogged queuefor energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.

“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.

All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.

This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) wasbehind a new capon the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills.

As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”

During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.

But Peltier said that ignores key context.

“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.

In a July 16letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.

With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.

“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.

In a July 18response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.

“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”

He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.

In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”

Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.

“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”

Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.

A spokesman for PJM pointed to afact sheetdescribing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.

When he hears projection for data center demand Lapp said he worries they are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.

That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.

“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.

It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.

“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-forecasts-annual-profit-below-100650891.html,2025-07-29 11:00:00,Yahoo Finance,"By Sriparna Roy and Sneha S K

(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group provided a full-year profit forecast on Tuesday after suspending its prior outlook in May, revealing billions of additional costs the company will face in the upcoming quarters.

The health insurer projected full-year adjusted earnings per share of at least $16, well short of analysts' already diminished estimates, while second-quarter profit also missed Wall Street expectations.

""While the $16 EPS floor was lower than expected, it does give investors/analysts a base to model off of, and potentially sets up UNH to return to the 'beat and raise' cadence that its investors had become accustomed to,"" said James Harlow, senior vice president at Novare Capital Management.

Company executives attributed the shortfall to higher medical costs than it had expected and other poor planning. It now sees medical costs for the year coming in $6.5 billion higher than initially projected.

""We significantly underestimated the accelerating medical trend and did not modify benefits or plan offerings sufficiently to offset the pressures we are now experiencing,"" said Tim Noel, the new CEO of the company's UnitedHealthcare health insurance unit.

UnitedHealth shares were down nearly 5% on Tuesday. They have fallen more than 40% this year.

UnitedHealth and other insurers have been hit hard this year by elevated medical costs. The company's underperformance led to the abrupt departure of CEO Andrew Witty in May.

Stephen Hemsley, who returned as chief executive, is under pressure to regain investor trust as the company faces financial struggles and reputational damage that surfaced after the then-CEO of its health insurance unit was gunned down on a New York City street in December.

""This is a challenging year for our enterprise. But I feel strongly we can overcome these challenges, as we have done before,"" Hemsley said in a call to discuss the results and forecast.

Underperformance of its Optum pharmacy benefit manager, which also provides financial consultation and other services, added to issues the company must address. Optum's quarterly revenue fell 7%, hurt by legacy customer contract revisions.

The company said the unit's 2025 profit will be $6.6 billion below its own expectations.

""There are areas that we have under-invested, and they include areas of Optum insight,"" Hemsley said, adding that there was a need for stable leadership and a product offerings upgrade.

The company in December had forecast 2025 adjusted profit of $29.50 to $30.00 per share before pulling that, nearly double its new view. UnitedHealth posted an adjusted profit of $27.66 per share in 2024.

Medical cost trends in its Medicare Advantage plans for older adults are now expected to run at about 7.5% in 2025, exceeding prior company expectations of just over 5%. The company anticipates these trends to continue to accelerate to nearly 10% next year.

UnitedHealth has a strong balance sheet, which will likely help the company to repair its problems, said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management.

UnitedHealth's adjusted second-quarter profit of $4.08 per share missed analysts' estimates by 40 cents.

You can show your support for this effortwith a donationto The Monitor.Read more about the partnership.

On the morning of Friday, March 14, a University of Maine accountant made a troubling discovery: she was unable to access the money that funded a residential program for rural high school girls interested in science careers.

It came at the end of a tumultuous week between the university and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That Monday, the USDA said it would cut all funding to public universities here as President Donald Trump ramped upa pressure campaignagainst Maine to change its policies allowing transgender girls in girls’ sports. Two days later, the USDAreversed that decision.

In the headlines, the university system and the agriculture department seemed like adversaries in a political drama. But for decades, they have quietly collaborated on scientific and rural economic development projects that are predominantly based at UMaine with regional reach.

So when the accountant learned that the agency had now paused the science education grant, she sent a polite but concerned email to USDA officials asking why, according to an email exchange obtained by the Bangor Daily News through a public records request.

When she did not receive a clear answer, she and her colleagues privately discussed how to manage the program while funding was frozen, records show. At one point, they wondered whether the pause had anything to do with the grant description in the USDA’s payment system: “Women and minorities in STEM.”

The exchange is a window into the confusion that has transformed life in Maine’s public university system. The Republican president’s administration has cut research grants across the country and in atargeted fashionagainst Maine.Over the past six months, UMaine and its sister schools saw grants paused, terminated and in many cases restored often without clear explanations.

In an interview, Joan Ferrini-Mundy, the Orono university’s president and vice chancellor for research and innovation for the university system, compared the disruption to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. UMaine has responded in a similar way: task forces and trying to make composed decisions that will best serve students and faculty, she said.

As an example, Maine’s universities did not draw attention to the scale of cuts they faced for much of the spring. That was until late May, when the system circulated a document detailing how the federal government hadheld up close to $50 million.

Some members of the UMaine community would prefer leaders to express more outrage about the cuts it faced, Ferrini-Mundy said. Others have cautioned a quieter approach to pushing back. She has tried to thread the needle between being transparent and keeping UMaine out of conflict that would endanger its long-term standing as the state’s research hub.

“We … want to keep students coming and not have the big story be, ‘What’s happening?’” she said. “It’s nothing like what’s happening at a Harvard or Columbia” — referring to the Ivy League schools heavily targeted by the administration — “and we don’t want to be pulled into that.”

Soon after Trump took office, Ferrini-Mundy convened the system’s Federal Action Stakeholder Task Force, a group of officials from different schools who meet three times a week to discuss shifts in federal policy, international student matters and internal communication, she said.

They discuss updates from another group, the Grant Review Task Force, set up to track the status of every federal grant affected by funding freezes. Often, its members are forced to plan with limited information, either because they were unsure if a terminated grant might be restored or because the federal government did not always provide a clear explanation.

Maine’s congressional delegation often tries to get answers. UMaine officials provide their offices with updates about money and the impact freezes are having, and the politicians and their staff leverage their relationships in Washington. It often begins with trying to figure out whether a grant is paused everywhere or just in Maine.

“It has been a daily event that we are trying to track down some level of funding,” U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat from Maine’s 1st District, said.

If it’s just Maine, Pingree said her staff usually begins by drafting a letter to the relevant agency. Sometimes, it makes better sense to collaborate with lawmakers from other states on nationwide programs. But the federal government doesn’t always provide a clear reason for its actions or grant an audience to hear an appeal.

The BDN reviewed dozens of emails between the USDA and UMaine showing how the agency paused eight awards this spring without citing a clear reason, prompting a string of follow-up emails from university officials that yielded only vague answers.

“As we await further guidance, we are asked to pause issuance of grant funding during the transition of government,” a grants management specialist for the agency wrote back on March 20 to the accountant who had inquired about the science education funding.

Over the next two months, UMaine’s top research administrators followed up with requests for clarity and guidance: Should the university proceed with its work? If work continues, would the university be reimbursed? Questions were forwarded to upper management, the agency replied.

Until this point, university officials had yet to refer to the more heated, public conflict that had played out between Maine and the USDA. But on May 21, Christopher Boynton, UMaine’s director of research administration, wrote a long email summarizing how the agency had yet to succeed in its more public efforts to penalize Maine’s funding.

In mid-March, the USDA had cleared the university system of any alleged violations of Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law that the Trump administration cited as a reason to investigate and withhold funding from Maine over its transgender athlete policies. (Maine’s public university system has no known transgender athletes.) A federal judge had also ordered the agency to return federal nutrition dollars that it had cut to the state government.

In early June, the USDA restored funding to one of the eight grants it had paused, allowing UMaine to restart a program that helps farmers, loggers and fishermen with disabilities stay in their jobs. Thedecisioncame after the stalled program received press coverage, including a BDN story about howan oyster farmerin Port Clyde faced going out of business, and  intervention from U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine delegation’s only Republican.

On July 1, the agency resumed funding to the remaining seven grants it had paused to UMaine, as well as three other awards for which UMaine was a subgrantee for another university. Again, the university credited help from Collins. The agency never provided an official explanation for the pause.

“Several awards across USDA, including some to the University of Maine, were suspended at the beginning of the transition to ensure alignment with priorities of the Administration,” a USDA spokesperson said this week in response to a request for comment. “Awards were either unfrozen or terminated after completion of a thorough review.”

Now that funding has resumed, UMaine has restarted programs related to aquaculture, rural economic development, and research intomaking sustainable jet fuel and fish foodfrom biomass, said Samantha Warren, the university system spokesperson.

But the system had tocancelthis summer’s multi-day residential program for high schoolers interested in STEM because the funding was inaccessible during when the school typically recruits students to participate, Warren said. The university also laid off a coordinator providing technical support to more than 80 farmers in the Northeast and Midwest but plans to rehire.

“Disruptions to the federal funding that the system and students rely on harms our communities and heritage industries and delays the progress created by these programs,” Collins, the top Senate appropriator, said in a statement. “I will continue to advocate for the important mission of UMaine and the entire system.”

As of this month, the federal government has restored 62 awards to the university system, more than $25 million of which remained unspent, while another 25 grants, nearly $6.5 million of which remained unspent, had been terminated or paused, Warren said.

The speed of terminations and pauses has slowed. The federal government had not paused any grants to the university system since late May, with one exception. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security ended a grant related to assessing campus threats that the University of Southern Mainehad applied forafter the 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston, Warren said.

The university has seen new grants come in, Ferrini-Mundy said. She is encouraging staff to pursue funding proposals for research aligned with the new administration’s priorities, such as artificial intelligence and nuclear energy. The federal government has not explained its abrupt decisions, and there was little value in speculating about why, the president said.

“I think we are never really going to know ,” she said. “The real key is that it was turned around, so we have the chance to do good work as we always do.”"

As Texas Republicans slowlymove forwardwithplans to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, Democrats in New York on Tuesday plowed ahead with their own scheme to counter any GOP redistricting efforts.

But the effort faces a long, arduous path forward and wouldn’t be scheduled to go into effect for years, illustrating the limited options at Democrats’ disposal as they hunt for ways to counter the GOP redistricting play in Texas.

Legislative Democrats in the blue stronghold unveiled a bill that would allow state lawmakers in Albany to conduct mid-decade redistricting — but only if another state were to do it first.

The proposal would, if enacted, effectively set up the prospect of a national redistricting tit-for-tat between Republicans and Democrats, with control of the House of Representatives in Washington potentially on the line.

However, there are key differences between what’s happening in New York and what’s happening in Texas, including the timing of any actual map changes. Texas Republicans are looking to immediately enact new district boundaries for the 2026 elections.

The bill in New York, which is technically a legislatively referred constitutional amendment, would allow the Legislature to redraw congressional districts if another state engages in mid-decade redistricting.

It would have to pass the Legislature in two consecutive sessions — and then still be approved by voters in a ballot measure. In theory, that means that whatever new maps that would be created wouldn’t be in place until the 2028 elections.

Like the first Trump presidency, the second one is playing out in a polarized political atmosphere. But while it isn’t massive, thereisa key difference thus far in how the public perceives Trump’s leadership.

Our running average of independent public polling finds that the president’s job approval rating is at 43%. This is a low number historically — but it is also a notch higher than at this point in 2017, the first year of Trump’s first term:

Our average consists of 13 polls released within the past two weeks, and it’s worth noting that this list includes a Gallup survey that put Trump’s approval at 37%, which is 3 to 8 points lower than every other poll in the average. So Trump is faring a bit better than he than he did eight years ago (or not as badly, depending on how you want to look at it).

As the 2026 midterm landscape takes shape, a key question is what level Trump’s job approval needs to be for Republicans to have a chance of keeping control of the House, where a net shift of just three seats would cost them.

With the electorate highly sorted along partisan linesand so many more seats now safely in the hands of either party, the battleground is unusually small.

The GOP doesn’t have to make inroads into otherwise Democratic terrain to keep the majority, which means the party could theoretically get by in 2026 without a broadly popular Trump. Democrats limited their losses to a handful of House seats in the 2022 midterms despite then-President Joe Biden’s low job approval rating (44% in the exit poll), bolstering the GOP’s hopes on this front.

If Trump can remain above his first-term levels and boost his current standing a few points, the playing field could be very competitive next year.

Of course, if his approval moves a few points in the other direction, the story could be very different.

It was around this point on the calendar that several presidents’ numbers shifted abruptly. In George W. Bush’s second term, chaos in Iraq, controversy over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina and his doomed nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court sent his approval rating into a tailspin from which it never rebounded.

And at this point four years ago, Biden’s average approval sat at 53%. But in short order, the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan played out, Biden’s standing sank, and it never recovered.

That having been said, abrupt and dramatic shifts in his image haven’t been the story for Trump during the 10 years he has occupied the national political stage. This is a president, and a man, who most people long ago made their minds up about. Most people, but not all.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/beloved-dunedin-restaurant-sallie-bistro-110000662.html,2025-07-30 11:45:00,Beloved Dunedin restaurant Sallie’s Bistro has closed,"DUNEDIN — A dinner at Sallie’s Bistro often began with an amuse bouche, something like a delicate tomato soup or a curried carrot bisque served in a tiny porcelain cup.

That little something extra — a tiny gift from the kitchen — always felt like an auspicious start to an evening at the petite Belgian bistro, which in its three-year lifespan amassed a solid local following for its creative European fare and warm hospitality.

Sallie’s run came to an abrupt halt in May, when, following personal loss and a life-threatening health crisis, owner Michèle Kamayi was forced to temporarily close the restaurant. Then last week, to the chagrin of many North Pinellas diners, Kamayi confirmed that Sallie’s would not reopen.

“Circumstances — deeply personal and beyond my control — began to take a toll, and I found myself in a position where I simply couldn’t continue,” Kamayi wrote in an Instagram post. “After the major surgery I had three months ago, it became clear that I had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life: to close the restaurant.”

When reached by phone, Kamayi called the events “bittersweet.”

“It wasn’t in my 10-year plan to stop the restaurant,” she said.

For both diners and Kamayi, however, there is a sliver lining: On Friday, Kamayi handed the keys to the storefront at 2152 Main St. to Angela Dulau-Lookretis, who in the coming months will open Alèdo Grille, a Mediterranean and Latin fusion restaurant that will lean heavily on Dulau-Lookretis’ Greek and Lebanese heritage.

Kamayi said she handpicked her successor to take over the space, even offering to help out in the interim as the new spot gets going.

Kamayi opened Sallie’s Bistro in 2022 with her then-husband Kieran Uylenbroek. The couple had relocated from Belgium during the pandemic, and wanted to bring traditional Belgian cuisine and European-centric fare to Tampa Bay diners.

For a long time, Uylenbroek ran the front of the house, greeting diners and waiting on tables, while Kamayi ran the kitchen. The restaurant developed a solid following of local fans. They came for the Carbonnade a la Flamande (a rich and velvety Flemish beef stew), the creamy cheese croquettes, the Moules Frites (Belgian mussels) and the decadent mushroom toast.

The restaurant’s unique spin on European fare appealed to Brad Carnall, who runs the popular blogDining Around Tampa Bay. Carnall has a knack for discovering off-the-beaten-path spots and smaller independent restaurants and he liked Sallie’s approach right off the bat.

“It piqued my curiosity because it was a Belgian restaurant, and we don’t really have much of that,” he said. Carnall recalled stopping by the restaurant during its opening month and enjoying a meal that included croquettes, a cod dish and beet panna cotta for dessert.

“I thought, ‘this is really something special’, Carnall said. ”It was hidden away in a corner of a strip mall with a Walmart. It was sort of a place that needed a vocal cheerleader, so I tried to be that for them.”

Carnall became a regular, returning for anniversaries and birthdays with his partner and also with large groups of friends. And there was a personal connection with Kamayi that stuck: Carnall recalled a birthday dinner where she brought out a surprise rabbit dish to-go. And while his father was dying of cancer last year, Kamayi would often check in on him, Carnall said.

“That was really appreciated,” he said.

For Kamayi, the restaurant was a place where she felt connected to the local community. It was a place of joy, even in the toughest of times, she said.

In March, things began to unravel. Kamayi’s marriage ended when her husband abruptly moved back to Europe. At first, she tried hiring help to manage the restaurant. That didn’t work for long. Kamayi’s 15-year-old daughter Ellie stepped in, taking care of the front of the house while her mother helmed the kitchen. At the same time, Kamayi was finishing up a degree in massage therapy, and getting up at 6 a.m. every day to drive to courses in Bradenton.

The stress — financial, physical and mental — proved too much for Kamayi, who said she soon became ill.

On May 9, at the onset of a packed Friday evening service, Kamayi started experiencing stomach pains. After an initial hospital visit and discharge, where Kamayi said she was given painkillers and told it was likely gastritis, the pain got so bad she had to scream for her son to call 911. She was hospitalized and underwent surgery, where doctors told her a previous hernia had caused life-threatening complications, including a rupture of her small intestine. She was in the early stages of sepsis when she was admitted.

Kamayi spent the next few months recovering while neighbors and friends dropped off food and started a GoFundMe to help with medical expenses and the cost of being out of work for so long.

“That community feeling — that’s something that I never experienced in my whole life,” Kamayi said. “I still am so grateful for that.”

Still, over at the restaurant, “the bills were starting to stack up.”

Eventually, Kamayi made the tough decision not to reopen.

“The only option for me was to sell the business,” she said. “I didn’t have any other options — I was too behind on rent.”

Kamayi has since recovered fully and is now a licensed massage therapist. She hopes to open her own practice within the next year or two and in the meantime is still accepting work as a private chef and caterer.

New owner Dulau-Lookretis, who also runs a popular salsa instruction studio, grew up in the hospitality industry, with parents who ran restaurants in Largo and Clearwater Beach. Though this will be her first brick-and-mortar, the restaurant business “was pretty much my calling since I was a little girl,” she said.

Though the menu is still in the early stages, Dulau-Lookretis said her family’s alfredo recipe and roasted leg of lamb will definitely make an appearance.

Building community will be the highlight, she said. That’s why, Kamayi said, she picked Dulau-Lookretis to take over the business.

“I wanted somebody who could contribute to the community,” she said. “I chose that person and I’m passing on that torch.”"

The United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, was thelargest providerof international humanitarian aid throughDemocratic and Republicanadministrations alike. USAID led the world in improvingglobal healthand eradicatingdiseasesbefore they crossed U.S. borders; provideddisaster reliefto people facing extreme crisis, conflict, and poverty; and promotededucation,economic development,environmental protection, anddemocratic governmentsaround the globe. Furthermore, USAID did this on a relatively small budget:0.6% of the 2024 U.S. budget.

USAID also directly benefitted the United States. USAID bought$2 billion annually directly from U.S. farmersto distribute around the world. USAID directly employed almost4,500 Americansand indirectly supported tens of thousands of others. In North Carolina alone, USAID provided nearly$1 billionto North Carolina nonprofits and universities annually. Because of USAID’s destruction, its contractors—including research institutes, faith-based charities, and non-governmental groups in North Carolina—have laid offthousands of staff, withsomeclosing their doors completely.

What does USAID’s closure mean to the world? Boston University has estimated that nearly300,000 peoplearound the world—about 103 an hour, mostly children—have died in justthe past six monthsas a result. Cuts to USAID could cause14 million deaths by 2030.An estimated1,500 babies a day are being born HIV-positivebecause USAID cuts stopped their mothers’ medication, and millions of doses of medicines—medicines that were donated by pharmaceutical companies—are sitting,expiring. Nearly$800,000 worth of foodintended to go to starving families has already been destroyed because it expired, sitting in warehouses.  Looking to U.S. economic and security interests, we are already seeingChinafillingvoidswhere USAID has withdrawn.

Where, then, do we go from here? Claims that fraud, corruption, andwastewere rampant in the agency are not accurate, and the myths about USAID that social media perpetuated aremisinformedanderroneous. However, there certainly are ways in which foreign aid can be reimagined to be even stronger and have even greater impact. Transforming America’s approach to international development from a cumbersome bureaucracy to a more nimble, dynamic, and collaborative enterprise could be a silver lining to emerge from USAID’s abrupt closure.

Whatever the form in which U.S. foreign aid exists moving forward, the cost ofnotreaching out to our global neighbors, of sitting by when we could save lives and make those lives healthier and more fulfilling, when we could prevent crises rather than using military might to stamp them down, is too great to fathom.

As the richest country in the world, we must be more generous than that. Political tides inevitably turn, and when they do, we must be ready to embrace fresh opportunities and to rebuild our approach to international engagement with more diversity, deeper humility, greater equity, and a joyful commitment to liberty, peace, and justice for all citizens of the world.

In the meantime, asking our congressional representatives for an accounting of where the funds will go that have been stripped from USAID—and how those funds will be even better used to improve lives here in the U.S. and to strengthen our economic, political, and security presence in the world— seems a fair question to ask."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/assembly-approves-100-bed-shelter-221000539.html,2025-07-30 23:00:00,Assembly approves new 100-bed shelter near downtown Anchorage,"Jul. 30—The Anchorage Assembly awarded a pair of contracts Tuesday night that will lead to a new homeless shelter opening near downtown by this fall.

""The goal is for Anchorage to have stable, year-round shelter, so that we don't have ups and downs in the summer and winter,"" said Thea Agnew Bemben, a special assistant to Mayor Suzanne LaFrance focused on homelessness, during remarks to the Assembly. ""This type of low-barrier shelter is a life-saving intervention.""

The plan from the LaFrance administration is to halve the number of permanent beds at the city-run shelter off East 56th Avenue in Midtown, a facility that was formerly part of Solid Waste Services. Administration officials say that the 200 people staying there each night is too many, putting a strain on the physical building and hindering the operator's ability to help residents connect with services and move on to more permanent housing.

Under the terms of the contracts approved at Tuesday night's meeting, the city will pay MASH Property Management $1.34 million to open and operate a 100-bed shelter at a site on East Fifth Avenue from Aug. 30 through the end of the year. The contract includes the option to extend the arrangement for two years after that.

The building is not owned by the municipality or MASH, but will be leased as part of the arrangement. The three-story structure previously housed Fantasies on 5th, a strip club, and after that a church.

The second contract is with Henning Inc., which will take over operations at the East 56th facility through the end of the year. Currently, the shelter is run by Catholic Social Services, which according to the administration did not want to extend its contract with the city.

Both Henning and MASH have worked with the city on housing and homelessness programs in recent years. The contracts come with a number of commitments and requirements, including to provide food to people staying there, support services, security and good-neighbor agreements with the surrounding communities.

Bemben said one of the considerations behind splitting up shelter capacity into two locations is that there would be enough extra room to ""surge up"" over the winter, when cold snaps often push more people to seek beds and warming indoors.

The strongest opposition to the proposal came from Assembly member Daniel Volland, who represents the downtown district. He said that in spite of commitments for years from city leaders, the neighborhoods he represents continue to bear the disproportionate brunt of supporting homelessness and treatment services.

""This was rammed down our throats,"" Volland said in an interview Wednesday, adding that he only found out about the proposed location two weeks prior to the Assembly vote. ""The lack of public process on these items has been appalling.""

He pointed out that in the same vicinity as the East Fifth Avenue site are three other private shelters: Brother Francis, the Hope Center and Covenant House.

Volland said that when the prior administration of Mayor Dave Bronson had moved similarly quickly and with a comparable public process to open new homeless shelter services, the Assembly would have scrutinized it far more closely.

""I am surprised by the LaFrance administration,"" Volland said.

He and two other members, Scott Myers from Eagle River and Keith McCormick of South Anchorage, voted against awarding the contract.

In an Assembly work session on the proposals earlier this week, members of the administration explained that their process for soliciting contract bids related to the shelters had been going on for months. If the selection of the Fifth Avenue location seemed abrupt, Bemben told Assembly members, it was because the administration was trying to coordinate with multiple parties and was negotiating the lowest price possible. But without a month to allow MASH to make renovations and coordinate taking on people currently staying at the Solid Waste Services location, the plan could fall apart.

Asked what would happen if the Assembly needed more time to consider the contracts, Susanne Fleek-Green, the mayor's chief of staff, said it could mean the municipality was 100 shelter beds short on Sept. 1, potentially putting those people out on the street.

""We would try to avoid that situation, but that is what we would have to work through very quickly,"" Fleek-Green said.

The other Assembly member from the downtown district, Chair Christopher Constant, voted in favor of the plan on Tuesday, just a day after strongly criticizing elements of it during the work session. He noted that in the past several years, the municipality has stood up supportive housing and shelter resources across several parts of town, enacting what's known as a ""scattered site"" model. But, Constant said, he had a problem with the administration pulling in money to pay for the contract from funds previously set for rehabilitating low-income housing, and asked LaFrance to seek an alternate funding source. The mayor promised to try doing so.

The contract with Henning was approved 10 to 1, with only Myers opposed."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-filed-alec-222758018.html,2025-07-30 23:00:00,Judge dismisses lawsuit filed by Alec Baldwin for malicious prosecution in fatal 'Rust' set shooting,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations in the 2021 fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”

The judge in a ruling made public Wednesday dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of any significant action with the claim, which was filed in state district court earlier this year. Baldwin’s attorneys will have 30 days to file a motion seeking reinstatement.

Luke Nikas, Baldwin's lead attorney, told The Associated Press in an email that the dismissal amounted to a nonevent since his team has been waiting to prosecute the case.

“We have been in good-faith settlement discussions with the parties to the lawsuit and will be refiling promptly if those discussions are not promptly and favorably resolved,” he said.

Defendants includespecial prosecutor Kari Morrisseyand Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office and the county board of commissioners.

Acharge of involuntary manslaughteragainst Baldwin was dismissed at trial last year on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense. The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff’s office months earlier by a man who said it could be related to the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

The allegations in Baldwin's tort claim include defamation, with his attorneys saying that prosecutors and investigators targeted the actor and coproducer for professional or political gain.

Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal for the movie“Rust”in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer — but not the trigger — and the revolver fired.

The actorrecently spoke to The Associated Pressat San Diego’s Comic-Con International, saying he couldn't believe what happened that day in court as the trial came to an abrupt end and that his life over the last year has been far better than the few years that preceded it.

Still, Baldwin and other producers of “Rust” are being sued in New Mexico state court by the parents and younger sister of Hutchins. Court records show a deposition for Baldwin in that case was put off in May and has yet to be rescheduled."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/opinion-why-trump-won-t-221537229.html,2025-07-31 02:45:00,Opinion: Why Trump Won’t Let Pam Bondi and Tulsi Gabbard Fail Up Like Pete Hegseth,"Washington has long been known for its summer scandals—from Watergate, the oil leak in the Gulf that stumped President Obama to last year’s abrupt reshuffling of the presidential race amidst charges of a coverup. This year, the cause of many heatwaves and meltdowns is the ongoing battle over the “Epstein files,” now entering its second month and showing no signs of slowing asCabinet officials(not to mention Trump’sbackers in Congressand across the MAGA landscape) seek a way out of a conspiracy that fueled the president’s rise—and now threatens to take him down.

Currently, Attorney General Pam Bondi is in a particularly precarious position, as the officialmost directly in the line of fireover the Epstein debacle. The MAGA base doesn’t want to turn on Trump, but they want someone to pay for the switcheroo they’ve been served and, having previously promised the release of those files that apparently may no longer exist, Bondi is the likely fall guy.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is also vulnerable—expendable, even. She is currently furiously ingratiating herself to the President—having fallen out of Trump’s graces with briefings that didn’t align with his preferred talking points—by cooking up a phony treason caseagainst former President Obama. It’s a desperate attempt at distraction from all things Epstein which, lo and behold, is not working.

(Countering the conclusion that Russian President Putin helped Trump win in 2016 is, however, just what Trump wants to hear.)

In Trump’s cabinet, blind loyalty is the credential that matters. “If the boss is happy, he doesn’t care about anything else,” explained Bill Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the non-partisan non-profit Brookings Institution. “My sense is he’s delighted to have Bondi and Gabbard in a bit of trouble, so they work harder to please him.”

It is also fair to say that Trump loves it when his lackeys have tofight among themselves. It’s mano a mano, even when it’s two women. To save her job, in other words, Gabbard has to throw Bondi and the DoJ under the bus.

“It’s like ‘The Apprentice’ taking place in the White House with Cabinet secretaries and top officials knowing that in order to survive they better do anything they can to please him, even when it’s not in the best interest of the American people,” added Michael Sozan, a senior fellow in governance, democracy and ethics at liberal think tank the Center for American Progress.

Sozan noted that Bondi brought inconspiracy theorists Kash Patel and Dan Bonginoto the Department of Justice to run the FBI. Those hires might be something Trump “foisted upon her,” he told The Daily Beast, “but she still sits at the apex of the decision-making. I don’t see how she successfully gets out of this.”

Who knows whether Bondi and Gabbard will be in their jobs a month from now, or six months from now. They are both scrambling to come up with something that will get Trump off the hook—and themselves too. Or, at least, until some better bait comes along; a phony investigation of Obama and his national security team can go on for months, even years, stirring the pot bysubpoenaing the people around the former presidentwithout coming up with anything actionable.

“The thing that everybody should have learned in the first Trump term is that total loyalty is not a guarantee of job security,” said Jack Pitney, a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California. “Sometimes loyalty doesn’t coincide with minimum competency,” he added, singling out Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who he predicts is so under-qualified that he will sooner or later make a mistake “bigger than” Trump can shield him from.

Of course, Hegseth, has already survived a series of mishaps, including theinappropriate sharing of classified information, which in any other administration would be job-ending. Elaine Kamarck, also with governance studies at Brookings, has a theory about why Hegseth remains impervious to criticism in Trump’s eyes: “In corporate America, one advantage men have always had is they could bond with the boss in a way that women couldn’t,” she said. “(Trump) clearly likes him.”

Still, the former Fox anchor is regarded by most seasoned observers to be a short-timer at the Defense Department. It’s the least well-kept secret in Washington. And it’s not a surprise that NBC News reported Hegseth recentlysounded out sources in Tennessee, where he currently lives, about potentially running for governor there, suggesting he might belooking for an off-rampfrom a job he never should have had in the first place.

In other words, he’ll get to fail upwards. Bondi and Gabbard, should they fail to get Trump out of the scrape he’s in, won’t be so lucky to waltz out the door with the commander-in-chief’s blessing."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mexico-judge-dismisses-alec-baldwins-022836021.html,2025-07-31 03:00:00,New Mexico judge dismisses Alec Baldwin's 'malicious' prosecution suit in 'Rust' case,"(Reuters) -A New Mexico judge has thrown out a misconduct lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against local prosecutors and sheriff's officials over their pursuit of criminal charges against him for the fatal 2021 shooting on the set of the Western movie ""Rust.""

Judge Casey Fitch dismissed Baldwin's complaint on Tuesday for lack of ""significant action"" in the case over the past 180 days. The one-page order, made public on Wednesday, allows any party in the lawsuit to seek reinstatement within 30 days.

In a statement later on Tuesday, Luke Nikas, a lawyer for Baldwin, said settlement discussions were underway and the case could be refiled if they were unsuccessful.

Baldwin sued special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, Santa Fe County law enforcement investigators and other public officials in January, accusing them of malicious abuse of process, defamation and mishandling of evidence.

The lawsuit said the prosecutors and others had conspired to manufacture a criminal case against Baldwin for political and personal gain when they charged him with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

The civil suit followed the abrupt dismissal of Baldwin's criminal case in July 2024 during his trial in the New Mexico capital.

The trial judge ruled then that the special prosecutor and sheriff's office had deliberately withheld evidence from Baldwin on the source of a live round that killed Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza.

Hutchins' death, Hollywood's first on-set fatal shooting in nearly 30 years, shocked the movie industry and sparked calls for an overhaul of firearms safety on film productions.

Morrissey has said prosecutors had long known the actor would file a retaliatory civil lawsuit.

The Ukrainian-born cinematographer died when Baldwin pointed a pistol at her while rehearsing, cocked the weapon and possibly pulled the trigger as they set up a camera shot on a movie set near Santa Fe, his lawyers said.

The gun, a reproduction 1873 single-action army revolver, fired a live round inadvertently loaded by Hannah Gutierrez, the production's weapons handler. Gutierrez was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March and sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Baldwin, also a ""Rust"" producer, has always said live rounds should not have been allowed on set and he was not responsible for weapons safety.

In early July, New Delhi officials attempted to put an abrupt end to the refuelling of cars that don't meet emissions requirements. ""The restriction applies to diesel vehicles over 10 years old and petrol vehicles over 15 years old,"" The Times of Indiareported.

This ban affected an estimated 6 million cars on the streets of New Delhi. Lawmakers tried to curb the megacity's dangerous and toxic air pollution by hiring police to monitor gas stations. ""We have been instructed to call in scrap car dealers if such vehicles come in,"" a traffic policeman posted at a fueling station in the citysaid.

Officials also installed number plate-recognizing cameras and loudspeakers at fueling stations, which, unfortunately, began malfunctioning and creating chaos in the city. ""Delhi's environment minister, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, told reporters the fuel ban was not feasible because of 'crucial issues related to technological glitches,'"" Phys.orgreported.

City officials have gone back to the drawing board to troubleshoot how to enforce the temporarily lifted ban, which will be re-enacted in November 2025.

This ban isn't news for the drivers of New Delhi. According to Phys.org, ""[older cars] were already banned from operating on New Delhi's roads by a 2018 Supreme Court ruling."" However, this ban was theoretical at best and ineffectual because it was not enforced.

City officials will resume the fueling ban across all six districts of New Delhi, citing that the disorganization of the first rollout led to its downfall. ""Unless there is a robust system and the ban is everywhere, it will not work,"" Sirsasaid.

November cannot come soon enough, asstudieshave shown that just in 2019, air pollution in India was responsible for 1.67 million premature deaths. Which, according to astudydone by Boston College, accounts for ""the largest pollution-related death toll in any country in the world — and also accounted for $36.8 billion in economic losses.""

Although this ban on older vehicles disproportionately affects citizens in lower economic classes who cannot afford newer vehicles, dangerous levels of pollution do as well. Wealthier citizens might not only have access to better healthcare, but they may also live outside the smog-filled city center. This kind of act is challenging to adapt to, but in the end, it works to protect the health and future economic prospects of the most vulnerable.

""One of our challenges is to provide the poor with greater access to devices and clean fuels that can be sustainably used in a variety of real-world conditions,"" School of Social Work Dean Yadamasaid. ""The more these are developed and tested in collaboration with communities — particularly the women, the devices' end users — the more likely their uptake.""

The Trump administration's efforts toundermine queer people's civil rights, healthcare access, and historical records, along with the violent deportation and internment of immigrants, raise essential questions about what the future looks like for those at the intersection of each community.As threats to immigrants, queer people, and the preservation of their shared histories grow increasingly dire,drag artistsacross New York City are taking to stages and streets to immortalize their own immigrant stories.

Felicia Oh

For Felicia Oh, a 30-year-old drag queen andTaiwaneseimmigrant, visibility meanseverything. Felicia began performing in 2021, immediately noticing a lack of safe spaces for AAPI audiences throughout the New York City drag scene.

Resonating with the feeling of being out of place as an immigrant, Felicia felt responsible for creating the spaces she wanted to see. ""In the States…or [your] home country, you can still feel like an outsider,"" she says, ""Drag helped me find that sense of belonging I never quite found anywhere else.""

Felicia took on the responsibility of organizing AAPI-focused drag events herself, booking Asian performers and collaborating with Asian-owned businesses, thereby bolstering queer patronage. ""[Everyone] is looking to see themselves represented onstage … There aren't enough spaces inNew Yorkwhere AAPIs can come and bask in their queer joy.""

Felicia continues, ""Drag has helped me feel proud to be from Taiwan, and I always try to champion that in my drag and the organizations I work with.""

Cherry Jaymes

Cherry Jaymes, 27, is one of the most charismatic forces in New York Nightlife, carving out spaces forBlack transpeople as a drag queen, model, and theater performer. A Liberian refugee, Cherry's family fled from the nation's capital city, Monrovia, to Baltimore, MD, when she was seven due to the ongoing war. ""My first conscious memories were…living in fear because there was a full-blown civil war happening.""

Cherry says the whiplash of such an abrupt move to the U.S. intensified her childhood need for an artistic outlet, and she later found theater as a source where she could flourish in her creativity.

Cherry explains, ""Liberian culture has shaped me because it's something I always come back to...In my journey as a trans woman, I look at myself as I keep changing, and realize I look like the Liberian women back home…I look like the women who came before me."" She says, feeling ""so lucky to have an inkling of what my diaspora is as an Americo-Liberian trans woman, and doing drag.""

Xana Whoria

To say Xana Whoria is simply a multi-hyphenate would be the understatement of the decade. At 26 years old, the Florida-bornMexicandrag artist is not only a prolific, award-nominated drag performer but also a Nike coach and decorated athlete, currently holding the record for the fastest ever course run at the New York City Marathon in the non-binary division.

Xana explains that due to growing up outside of Mexico, living everywhere from South America to Europe, ""[Mexico] never felt like where my roots were planted."" Elaborating, they explain that drag felt like a means of reconnection from the opposite end of the continent, ""If I can'tbeinMexico...Through drag, I can embody my culture in a genderless way that I didn't know was possible.""

For Xana, drag is a medium for healing the person underneath it all. Growing up in a culture where ""gender roles are completely imposed on you,"" Xana explains how their mother would force them to wear enormous hair bows, attend church, and speak in a feminine manner. Xana says their drag allows them to reevaluate the gendered roles they were forced into: ""I realized Icanwear these bows, and Icanstill dress in a more masculine way, and Icando these things from my culture on my terms.""

Emi Grate

Emi Grate, a 31-year-old drag artist from Mandalay, Burma, says her drag is about shifting how American drag audiences view immigrants. Operating at the intersection of arts, activism, and academia, Emi's intellectual approach to drag uses entertainment to educate.

Emi moved to the U.S. for college, and they questioned ""everythingabout America."" This led them into ""some uncomfortable situations being queer, from Asia, in a sea of Midwesterners."" Having moved from Burma to multiple Midwestern universities, and ultimately to NYC, Emi explains how constant emigration made sense to them. And by the time they moved to New York, their drag persona had already been born.

Emi explains that many Americans' negative attitudes toward immigrants stem from how they are inherently discussed as outsiders. ""'Immigration' is the idea that someone is enteringyourspace.Emigrationframes it as leavingmyspace,mycomfort zone, and going somewhere else."" Emi states, ""So I think that distinction was an important philosophy for my drag…it's all about taking up space formyselfrather than being a foreigner in someone else's.""

Maljo Blu

Maljo Blu, a 25-year-old drag artist born and raised inNew York City, says drag has made her feel like astoryteller.""Every drag queenisa production in themselves,"" she explains.

Maljo explains that her mother, an immigrant fromTrinidad and Tobago, played a prominent role in developing her close connection with her culture, taking her to visit the island every summer since birth. In Maljo's drag, the Trinidadian cultural traditions she grew up with play a key role in many looks and performances she's crafted, saying, ""In retrospect, I realized that [at Carnival] I'd been watching my family do drag all together. The beads, feathers, wigs, makeup; there was just this sense of pageantry.""

Maljo's drag is all about placing cultural mythology through a theatrical lens. ""We talk about immigrant stories [mostly] from a place ofstrife."" She says. ""Everything I do with my drag comes from a place of joy...I get to take a little bit of my family's joy and bring it to the stage.""

The 21-year-old Daniella, born in Bogotá,Colombia, was adopted by white parents as a baby and raised in Carmel, Indiana. ""They always tried their best to connect me with my culture, but there were big pieces that were missed,"" she explains.

Despite being a first-generation American herself, Daniella says her status as an immigrant is ""nuanced,"" she explains, as she didn't ""know if I was allowed to identify as an immigrant [or] what to make of my heritage being different from the rest of my family.""

Due to the details of her adoption process, Daniella still has little information about her biological family, taking her many years to feel comfortable with so many unanswered questions regarding her heritage. At the same time, Daniela shares how she would never know what her biological mother looks like. ""I can look in the mirror every day for the rest of my life and not know what features are hers…My drag is about connecting with my roots, and using my femininity to find the pieces I still can't see.""

Atomic Annie

Atomic Annie, the author's drag persona, comes from a family with a complex immigration history, windingcenturiesfrom frigidRussiato coastal Italy. Despite always feeling drawn to her ancestry, it was not until Annie's grandmother passed away that her curiosity about family culture began to feel like an inheritance.

The daughter of a Russian-born father, whose family fled Kishinev (now Chișinău, Moldova) for New York, Atomic’sgrandmother, Ellen, believed deeply in the importance of documenting our history. On her grandmother's 80th birthday, she penned a ""legacy letter"" reflecting on her family's difficult assimilation as Eastern European Jews in New York, writing, ""My grandmother never really assimilated. She spoke only Yiddish, and she was an unhappy person … Unfortunately, no one wanted to talk about the family's early life in Russia, so our questions went unanswered.""

For decades, Atomic Annie’s grandmother researched their lineage, collected artifacts, exchanged letters with distant relatives, and assembled scrapbooks packed with sepia photographs and long-neglected documents, turning scattered fragments into a mosaic of their family's past before America.

Since her passing, Atomic Annie has felt a sense of responsibility for preserving our history, and her drag has evolved into something more culturally grounded. I walk in the footsteps of my immigrant ancestors and weave their history into my craft as a queen descended from immigrants.

Delta Air Lines Flight 56 landed safely at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport shortly before 8 p.m. local time Wednesday, the airline said. The flight was operating on an Airbus A33-900 with 275 passengers and 13 crew members on board.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul Fire Department and paramedics responded to the gate to provide initial medical attention, the Metropolitan Airports Commission said.

The airline said 25 of those on board, including seven crew members, were taken to the hospital ""for evaluation and care."" All have since been released, the airline said Thursday.

Passengers will continue on to Amsterdam from Minneapolis-St. Paul on a special flight Thursday evening, Delta said.

Leeann Nash, who was on the flight with her husband,told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTPthat dinner service had just started on the flight when the turbulence came out of nowhere.

""There was actually no warning. It was a very abrupt, hard hit,"" Nash said. ""If you didn't have your seat belt on -- everyone that didn't -- they hit the ceiling, and then they fell to the ground, and the carts also hit the ceiling and fell to the ground, and people were injured, and it happened several times, so it was really scary.""

""And you know, those carts are very heavy, so we were fortunate that we had seat belts on at the time, but we still saw cellphones flying around quite a bit,"" Nash added. ""But I will hand it to the flight attendants, they were incredibly calm, very well trained and very responsive.""

The Trump administration's efforts toundermine queer people's civil rights, healthcare access, and historical records, along with the violent deportation and internment of immigrants, raise essential questions about what the future looks like for those at the intersection of each community.As threats to immigrants, queer people, and the preservation of their shared histories grow increasingly dire,drag artistsacross New York City are taking to stages and streets to immortalize their own immigrant stories.

Felicia Oh

For Felicia Oh, a 30-year-old drag queen andTaiwaneseimmigrant, visibility meanseverything. Felicia began performing in 2021, immediately noticing a lack of safe spaces for AAPI audiences throughout the New York City drag scene.

Resonating with the feeling of being out of place as an immigrant, Felicia felt responsible for creating the spaces she wanted to see. ""In the States…or [your] home country, you can still feel like an outsider,"" she says, ""Drag helped me find that sense of belonging I never quite found anywhere else.""

Felicia took on the responsibility of organizing AAPI-focused drag events herself, booking Asian performers and collaborating with Asian-owned businesses, thereby bolstering queer patronage. ""[Everyone] is looking to see themselves represented onstage … There aren't enough spaces inNew Yorkwhere AAPIs can come and bask in their queer joy.""

Felicia continues, ""Drag has helped me feel proud to be from Taiwan, and I always try to champion that in my drag and the organizations I work with.""

Cherry Jaymes

Cherry Jaymes, 27, is one of the most charismatic forces in New York Nightlife, carving out spaces forBlack transpeople as a drag queen, model, and theater performer. A Liberian refugee, Cherry's family fled from the nation's capital city, Monrovia, to Baltimore, MD, when she was seven due to the ongoing war. ""My first conscious memories were…living in fear because there was a full-blown civil war happening.""

Cherry says the whiplash of such an abrupt move to the U.S. intensified her childhood need for an artistic outlet, and she later found theater as a source where she could flourish in her creativity.

Cherry explains, ""Liberian culture has shaped me because it's something I always come back to...In my journey as a trans woman, I look at myself as I keep changing, and realize I look like the Liberian women back home…I look like the women who came before me."" She says, feeling ""so lucky to have an inkling of what my diaspora is as an Americo-Liberian trans woman, and doing drag.""

Xana Whoria

To say Xana Whoria is simply a multi-hyphenate would be the understatement of the decade. At 26 years old, the Florida-bornMexicandrag artist is not only a prolific, award-nominated drag performer but also a Nike coach and decorated athlete, currently holding the record for the fastest ever course run at the New York City Marathon in the non-binary division.

Xana explains that due to growing up outside of Mexico, living everywhere from South America to Europe, ""[Mexico] never felt like where my roots were planted."" Elaborating, they explain that drag felt like a means of reconnection from the opposite end of the continent, ""If I can'tbeinMexico...Through drag, I can embody my culture in a genderless way that I didn't know was possible.""

For Xana, drag is a medium for healing the person underneath it all. Growing up in a culture where ""gender roles are completely imposed on you,"" Xana explains how their mother would force them to wear enormous hair bows, attend church, and speak in a feminine manner. Xana says their drag allows them to reevaluate the gendered roles they were forced into: ""I realized Icanwear these bows, and Icanstill dress in a more masculine way, and Icando these things from my culture on my terms.""

Emi Grate

Emi Grate, a 31-year-old drag artist from Mandalay, Burma, says her drag is about shifting how American drag audiences view immigrants. Operating at the intersection of arts, activism, and academia, Emi's intellectual approach to drag uses entertainment to educate.

Emi moved to the U.S. for college, and they questioned ""everythingabout America."" This led them into ""some uncomfortable situations being queer, from Asia, in a sea of Midwesterners."" Having moved from Burma to multiple Midwestern universities, and ultimately to NYC, Emi explains how constant emigration made sense to them. And by the time they moved to New York, their drag persona had already been born.

Emi explains that many Americans' negative attitudes toward immigrants stem from how they are inherently discussed as outsiders. ""'Immigration' is the idea that someone is enteringyourspace.Emigrationframes it as leavingmyspace,mycomfort zone, and going somewhere else."" Emi states, ""So I think that distinction was an important philosophy for my drag…it's all about taking up space formyselfrather than being a foreigner in someone else's.""

Maljo Blu

Maljo Blu, a 25-year-old drag artist born and raised inNew York City, says drag has made her feel like astoryteller.""Every drag queenisa production in themselves,"" she explains.

Maljo explains that her mother, an immigrant fromTrinidad and Tobago, played a prominent role in developing her close connection with her culture, taking her to visit the island every summer since birth. In Maljo's drag, the Trinidadian cultural traditions she grew up with play a key role in many looks and performances she's crafted, saying, ""In retrospect, I realized that [at Carnival] I'd been watching my family do drag all together. The beads, feathers, wigs, makeup; there was just this sense of pageantry.""

Maljo's drag is all about placing cultural mythology through a theatrical lens. ""We talk about immigrant stories [mostly] from a place ofstrife."" She says. ""Everything I do with my drag comes from a place of joy...I get to take a little bit of my family's joy and bring it to the stage.""

Lisandro Madrigal appeared in court just two days after the restaurant owner abruptly shut the doors at all Sacramento-area locations.

Sacramento Superior Court documents, filed on March 26, 2024, showed that on count one, Lisandro Madrigal, allegedly caused injury resulting in a traumatic condition to an unnamed woman, with whom Madrigal possibly had a past dating relationship.

Officials said that on the second count, it is alleged that Madrigal personally inflicted serious bodily injury to the woman.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/paula-deen-abruptly-closed-savannah-145529620.html,2025-08-01 16:00:00,Paula Deen has abruptly closed the Savannah restaurant that launched her to Food Network fame,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.

Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, “Paula's Home Cooking,” in 2013.

But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with The Chicken Box, which sold takeout lunches behind the main restaurant. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.

“Hey, y’all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,” Deen's statement said.

“Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,” she said. “We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.”

Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.

Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: “It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.”

Deen's restaurant seemed `packed' until it closed

Adrienne Morton and her family, visiting Savannah from Cincinatti, had made dinner reservations at Deen's restaurant for 5:45 p.m. Friday.

Morton said she received a text message Friday morning saying her reservation had been canceled.

“I thought this must be a mistake or maybe they planned to close and we don’t live here and just weren’t up to speed, but no,"" Morton said. “We wish them the best. Hopefully everything turns out.""

Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.

“Nobody knew anything was wrong,” Rowe said. “I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.”

Deen went from nearly broke to Food Network fame in Savannah

Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.

The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his “meal of the year” in 1999.

Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted “Paula's Home Cooking” in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.

The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public that included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.

Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, “Yes, of course,” though she added: “It’s been a very long time.”

Deen returned to television on ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars,” on chef Gordon Ramsay’s Fox show “MasterChef: Legends,” and on Fox Nation, which began streaming “At Home With Paula Deen” in 2020. She also posts cooking videos to a YouTube channel that has more than 520,000 subscribers."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-pal-laura-loomer-says-164133251.html,2025-08-01 17:15:00,Trump pal Laura Loomer says she’s running a tipline to purge the ‘disloyal’ from federal government,"Laura Loomer is rolling in the deep state these days.

While the MAGA provocateur has no official position inDonald Trump’s administration,Loomerhas played a fairly outsize role in theabrupt firingsof more thana dozen top officials across the federal government. And she says she’s gearing up for more.

The self-described strategist and journalist — who first rose to attention during Trump’s first term by staging viral stunts in which she filmed herself screaming at prominent Democrats and posting the videos to social media — toldPoliticoon Friday that she expects to be involved in “hundreds” more firings of administration appointees and career government workers.

Loomer said she’s enthusiastically acting as a sounding board for political appointees within the Trump administration who are eager to snitch on one another for perceived disloyalty to the president using her “tipline.”

“I’m happy to take people’s tips about disloyal appointees, disloyal staffers and Biden holdovers,” Loomer said. “And I guess you could say that my tipline has come to serve as a form of therapy for Trump administration officials who want to expose their colleagues who should not be in the positions that they’re in.”

The former Florida congressional candidate has long been a favorite of Trump, who repeatedly brought her on his private plane during last year’s presidential election.

He — or someone in the administration, though Loomer will not say who — has granted her multiple appointment passes to visit theWest Wingand meet with administration officials.

One infamous trip to the Oval Office early on in Trump’s term ended with the ouster of multipleNational Security Councilofficials after Loomer presented Trump with what she called “vetting materials” on appointees brought in by his then-National Security Adviser, Mike Waltz.

Loomer frequently posts to social media the results of what she calls “vetting,” which often includes digging through her targets’ family connections for anything that she can use to indicate disloyalty or other suspect qualities.

In the case of other targets, such as one of Waltz’s then-deputies, Harvard-educated lawyer and North Korea expert Alex Wong, their race or ethnicity is enough to trigger Loomer into action.

In April, she began posting incessantly about Wong to highlight his Chinese heritage (his parents are immigrants from Hong Kong) and that of his wife, who is also of Chinese descent. Loomer also attacked Wong’s wife for having worked as a federal prosecutor in Washington during the Biden administration even though his wife is a nonpartisan civil servant.

Wong was fired the next month.

Loomer has also targeted top defense and intelligence officials on similarly spurious grounds. In May, she posted a series of attacks on Dr. Terry Adirim, then director of the CIA’s Center for Global Health, highlighting the physician’s role in Biden administration vaccine policy. Adirim was fired shortly thereafter.

And just this week, the administration sacked National Security Agency General Counsel April Doss, a career government lawyer, after Loomer posted to X about her.

For her part, Loomer described the Trump administration as being in the midst of a “vetting crisis” and said she’s in frequent contact with top-level officials who use her as a sounding board.

“I have people in the West Wing ... I have people in pretty much every single agency within the federal government like me, every main agency coming to me with concerns,” she said."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/starting-b-b-trend-red-172100246.html,2025-08-01 18:15:00,"After starting the B&B trend in Red Wing, the Pratt-Taber Inn will return to a private home","Aug. 1—RED WING, Minn. — Deb Bylander and Ron Fritz are closing the door on their time as innkeepers of the Pratt-Taber Inn in Red Wing.

As ""one of the oldest houses in the community,"" the inn built around 1870 has housed more than 20 years of guests since Bylander restored the inn in 2005. The 5,404-square-foot inn is returning to a private residence.

""We've had many, many repeat visitors that become like family and it's a hard thing to leave behind,"" Bylander said of hosting guests at 706 W. Fourth St.

Between the butternut woodwork in the entryway, ""beautiful staircase"" and ""ornate"" wood doors, Realtor Linda Everett said it's ""hard to pick"" which are the best features. She loves stepping into the home's history including the ""grandeur"" of the entryway and salon. The Italienete, brick style home became known by its second owners, Albert W. and Agnes Pratt. A.W. Pratt was one of three founders of the Pierce, Simmons and Company Bank.

""It's a small segment of house hunters that are looking for a massive old historic building with all of its issues and it can sometimes take many years for a property to sell. And it sold within four days,"" Bylander said. The home was listed at $557,500.

After working many years as a nurse in the emergency department in Minneapolis, Bylander had a vision for how she didn't want her life to look: ""bitter old maids"" without friends who fill their time playing bingo at the casino. Instead, she met friends weekly through the inn. They would find guests who had overlapping friends or grew up in the same town.

""I tried to talk myself out of it but every time I came to look at it, I would see something wonderful that the rest (in need of repair) just kind of canceled out,"" Bylander said.

From her ""mid-life crisis"" decision to successfully hosting repeat guests, Bylander kept a phrase on repeat: ""failure's not an option."" Her house sold and hours reduced at the hospital, she moved ""down in the mess."" The inn was without owners for about eight years and the property had deteriorated, such as frozen radiators and plaster damage.

She kept the phrase through the recession as ""all of the inns were sitting empty,"" Bylander said.

""I just really enjoy about the house is just the overall attention to detail and everything that Deb has done to the property,"" Everett said. ""She tried to keep it within the period and everything just looks seamless.""

With the inn's listing on the National Register of Historic Places and historic districts nearby, Bylander said the updates needed to follow historic requirements and the ticket price that comes with them. The Register lists the inn's build date around 1870 to 1875. The Historic Mall District with the courthouse and library and the Residential Historic District are nearby the inn. Everett said the ""quaint"" nature of Red Wing includes downtown buildings with active businesses. The inn also neighbors the Theodore Sheldon house, built in 1875.

Red Wing has three bed and breakfasts: the Moondance Inn, Octagon House Retreat and Round Barn Farm. The Moondance and Octagon House are also on the Historic Register.

""I feel with the aid of grants and tax breaks, I will sooner be able to complete the restoration and I feel the whole town of Red Wing, a scenic River town with a background of Heritage Preservation, will benefit,"" wrote Donald Winblad, one of the inn's owners, in the 1979 application for placement on the National Register.

While Everett said the inn is her favorite historic building in Red Wing, she and Bylander agree the Sheldon Theatre built in 1904 is ""glorious."" Guests even travel from Canada to attend the shows.

""It pulls at my heart strings because it is such a beautiful property,"" Everett said of the inn. She also sold it to Bylander 20 years ago.

After years of collecting decorations, Bylander created four guest rooms named after the seasons. Each room has its own fireplace (with some of the original fireplaces remaining) and bathroom. The inn originally had shared bathrooms when it opened in 1984. The Post Bulletin reported the inn ""initiated the B&B trend"" in Red Wing. The once Mrs. B's, now Hotel Lanesboro, was the first to open in Lanesboro.

The treasured pieces discovered at estate sales and thrift stores are French-inspired from the 1930s to 1950s. The furniture is ""a little more graceful"" than the ""very stiff"" Victorian style. Bylander said her ""cherished items"" will make it to their next home until they can have a sale of their own.

""I'm a little off the top with my decor and people kind of tend to expect it of me. ... At Christmas especially, the mantles are pretty grandiose,"" Bylander said. ""I love to be exaggerating things and make it fun for people to see and come back year after year and it's always different. And it's a way to display your artistic side.""

A ""large outdoor entertainment venue"" with a fireplace, hydrangeas, lilacs and views of Barn Bluff and church steeples is in the backyard along with several porches.

From serving breakfast in the morning to preparing rooms and connecting guests with local amenities, Bylander said the bed and breakfast life is 24/7. The breakfasts, cooked by Fritz, switched between seven recipes such as French toast, sweet potato hash and frittatas. Bylander and Fritz, who were married in 2014, lived in the refurbished basement.

""Most of our guests are probably middle-aged and it's fun because it gives them a chance to share their stories because everyone they know has heard the stories. And so we get some pretty lively discussions at the table in the morning for breakfast,"" Bylander described.

After 20 years running the Pratt-Taber Inn, Bylander said the quick sale brought an ""abrupt stop"" to their innkeeper journey.

""It was refreshing to see young couples and older married couples that are still enjoying life and treating themselves to a special weekend or a night here,"" Bylander said. ""It's been uplifting that way."""
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/heart-attack-cardiac-arrest-heart-163055916.html,2025-08-01 19:15:00,Heart attack or cardiac arrest: when the heart goes wrong,"HENDERSON, Ky (WEHT) – The heart is the engine that pumps blood throughout the body and controls blood pressure and rhythm.

When it goes wrong, the results can be catastrophic, leading to cardiac arrest or a heart attack.

To understand the differences, Eyewitness News asked Deaconess Health System to give us more insight via Interventional Cardiologist Irfan Siddiqui, MD.

When one hears the terms cardiac arrest and heart attack, some might think that it is one in the same. In reality, the two are drastically different. Siddiqui says cardiac arrest is a complete cessation of all heart and lung function, which is associated with a loss of consciousness.

Hulk Hogan’s cause of death was a heart attack, medical examiner says

“A person will lose their pulse and breathing in a cardiac arrest and require immediate resuscitation in the form of CPR to maintain blood circulation in the body,” he says.

Likewise, a heart attack refers to an abrupt blockage in a heart artery that leads to heart damage. Siddiqui says this can be accompanied by pain in the chest, arm and jaw along with nausea and excessive sweating.

“While a very severe heart attack may lead to cardiac arrest if the heart damage is severe enough, this does not happen in the majority. Similarly, not all cardiac arrests are due to heart attack and may be due to other causes,” he says.

Between the two, Siddiqui says heart attacks happen more frequently than cardiac arrest since only a small percentage are severe enough to lead to cardiac arrest.

Pinellas County Forensic Science Center documents state former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan passed away on July 24, 2025, from acute myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack. An initial report stated Hogan died after suffering cardiac arrest, and Siddiqui says studies have shown professional athletes do have a higher risk of cardiac arrest due to possible undiagnosed, underlying conditions combined with the high intensity of physical activity required.

Siddiqui says cardiac arrest for professional athletes varies from 1 in 34,000 to 1 in 80,000. For comparison, the general population rate is around 1 in 100,000.

Professional athlete or not, Siddiqui says there are several risk factors that can increase someone’s risk for a heart attack including high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, family history of heart disease at an early age, obesity and poor diet habits and sedentary lifestyle.

“If there is a family history of sudden death at a young age, this may indicate underlying heart disease related to the electrical system or heart muscle itself,” he added. “It is important to mention to your doctor if there is a history in the family of a young individual passing away suddenly without warning.”

There have been some cases where certain diseases have lead to unexpected cardiac arrest, but Siddiqui says heart attacks often have telltale signs before one does happen. He also adds a heart attack may not always have preceding signs before it happens.

Is heart disease reversible?

He says when it comes to cardiac arrest, unfortunately, it has a low survival rate and may be below 15% in most populations. That figure is higher for professional athletes during a sporting event, 45-70%, due to the presence of medical personnel that are usually on sight and bystanders.

In any case, Siddiqui says immediate action always increases the chance of survival by way of bystander CPR and immediately alerting emergency medical services.

“If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is present, it is vital to apply this to the patient, so it can assess for a heart rhythm that may be shocked and returned to normal,” he adds.

If one does survive a heart attack or cardiac arrest, Siddiqui says it is crucial to investigate and determine the cause so appropriate measures can be taken. An example Siddiqui gave was a large blood clot causing cardiac arrest. In that case, the patient would be put on blood thinners to prevent future clots.

“A cardiac arrest may not always be due to a heart attack and may be due to other things such as a large blood clot to the lung, electrical disease of the heart and other factors not necessarily heart related,” he says.

Studies have indicated that cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, but Siddiqui says to take it with a grain of salt due to many different types of medial issues that can lead to cardiac arrest.

“Often different conditions that may be life-threatening lead to a cardiac arrest before a person passes away,” he said. “This is why now it is generally not recommended to list ‘cardiac arrest’ as a cause of death as it is the common endpoint for many terminal diseases and conditions and does not provide details to the exact cause which led to this common endpoint.”

Siddiqui says in his personal experience, he has not seen any drastic increase in cardiac arrest cases, but there may be rising cases that are labeled cardiac arrest due to immediate recognition and treatment, which may result in higher survival chances and medical attention.

“This is why education in recognizing cardiac arrest and being able to provide immediate bystander resuscitation is even more important to increase the chances of survival,” he said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-names-wayne-deveydt-cfo-211439511.html,2025-08-02 03:00:00,Yahoo Finance,"(Reuters) -UnitedHealth Group said on Thursday it will replace its finance chief John Rex with an external hire, Wayne DeVeydt, adding to the management changes at the health insurer that has been struggling to control its medical costs.

Rex, who has been the company's CFO since 2016, will continue as a strategic adviser to the CEO, with the changes effective September 2.

DeVeydt, 55, was most recently managing director and operating partner at Bain Capital, and was also the finance chief of UnitedHealth's rival Elevance, then called Anthem, between 2007 and 2016.

During his tenure at Anthem, DeVeydt oversaw the company's $4.9 billion acquisition of Amerigroup in 2012 and was involved in the attempted $54 billion acquisition of Cigna, which was ultimately blocked by regulators.

DeVeydt will get an annual base salary of $1 million and other benefits such as equity awards and a $2 million life insurance policy, UnitedHealth said.

The largest U.S. health insurer had seen an abrupt departure of Andrew Witty as CEO in May, with Stephen Hemsley replacing him.

Hemsley, who led UnitedHealth for more than a decade until 2017, has re-taken the reins following several setbacks for the company, including a cyberattack last year, federal investigations, soaring medical costs and a top executive's murder.

Earlier this week, UnitedHealth provided a full-year adjusted profit forecast of at least $16 per share after suspending its prior outlook in May, and revealed billions of additional costs the company will face in the upcoming quarters.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/local-minority-entrepreneurs-shut-down-001942164.html,2025-08-02 03:00:00,Local resource for minority entrepreneurs shut down with no notice,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (WSAV) – A resource that offers underserved people in Savannah the chance to start a business closed Thursday with no warning to the employees or the entrepreneurs.

Those who worked at the Access to Capital Women’s Business Center (ACE-WBC) said they believe the closure was a result of a lack of federal funding.

“We were informed that it’s a possibility that this program would be eliminated and not be in the budget. However, the WBC as well as our sister organization, our host organization, did reassure us that it’s a possibility that we could continue on,” Former Program Director at ACE-WBC Savannah Vernell Stewart said. “I was hoping that we could actually weather the storm, but it looks like we just weren’t able to.”

The ACE-WBC was part of a network of centers that cater to those in low-income or minority populations. They’re funded through a variety of sources, including federal money funneled through the Small Business Administration.

However, now, with potential funding cuts looming according to employees, the Savannah ACE-WBC is closing permanently.

“Our WBC in Savannah was the educational arm so what we did is we provided business advisory services, training, all types of programs,” Stewart said.

The ACE-WBC also helped clients access to what are called character-based loans, loans that banks typically would not be able to fund.

“We really spent the last three years engaging our community, really learning and listening what the needs of the entrepreneurs are, which helped us create different programming that specifically addressed those needs,” Stewart said.

All services were offered free of charge to get new entrepreneurs’ businesses off the ground.

“You would not believe the products our local community have developed, the fact that these merchants will never see that unless they go out and do the things that we were doing,” Stewart said. “Being removed from the community at this point because we’ve spent so much time developing and cultivating these relationships is leaving a void that we came here to fill.”

The ACE-WBC had a series of upcoming events and workshops, which are still listed on their website.

Due to the center’s abrupt closure, former employees said they’re doing their best to notify clients.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/600m-bullish-bets-liquidated-bitcoin-020943263.html,2025-08-02 07:30:00,Yahoo Finance,"Crypto markets experienced a sharp bout of volatility over the past 24 hours, with more than $630 million in leveraged positions liquidated across exchanges.

The bulk of the damage came from longs, which accounted for over $580 million of total liquidations, as traders were caught offside during an abrupt intraday sell-off.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $115,200, erasing some of its recent gains but still maintaining a relatively stable posture compared to other majors. Its dominance rose slightly as altcoins bore the brunt of the correction.

Ether (ETH) fell to $3,687, while XRP (XRP) retraced under $3 despite strong recent headlines. Solana (SOL) pulled back to $170, and BNB (BNB) eased to $780 after a record run last week that punted it above $855.

Coinglass data shows the largest single liquidation was a $13.7 million ETH long on Binance.

Liquidations occur when traders using leverage (borrowed funds) are forcibly closed out of their positions because their collateral falls below required maintenance thresholds. This typically amplifies price volatility, especially in short timeframes, as liquidated positions create sudden selling or buying pressure depending on the side of the trade.

For traders, liquidation data provides insight into market sentiment and risk of positioning. High liquidation totals — particularly concentrated in one direction (e.g., longs) — often signal overextended positioning. This can indicate possible inflection points or impending reversals as the market resets.

Tracking real-time liquidation heatmaps and funding rates can help traders identify areas of forced selling or buying, often around key support/resistance levels, time entries or exits during high-volatility zones and gauge market leverage and risk-on/off behavior

Speculative altcoins were particularly affected. Solana-ecosystem tokens such as Fartcoin (FART), Pump.fun (PUMP) and Jupiter (JUP) all faced steep intraday corrections.

“We observe that tokens like Fartcoin and Pump.fun are less aligned with broader market beta and more reflective of high-volatility, sentiment-driven microcycles,” said Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, said in a Telegram message.

“The recent corrections — FART dropping 14% to retest its 100-day EMA near $1, JUP losing support at its 200-day EMA, and PUMP continuing its slide within a descending channel — appear to stem from profit-taking and waning short-term momentum, not from a systemic market shift.”

Lee added that Bitcoin’s relative strength, supported by ETF inflows and macroeconomic stability, reinforces the view that the pullback is isolated, not broad-based.

Bitcoin holding above $115,000 remains the market’s anchor. Unless that level breaks, the broader structure stays intact."

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)

When water from melting glacier inundated her Juneau neighborhood last August, Danielle Lindoff made a hasty escape through a front window in her living room, her two unhappy cats in tow. She climbed onto a boat mobilized by her husband, and as he steered, she held a flashlight to scout in the dark for submerged mailboxes that they might bump on their way to safety.

Though the Mendenhall River flowing by their backyard had been swollen with floodwaters in past years – and though the Lindoffs had taken precautions last summer like sealing doorways and stacking sandbags – the Aug. 5-6, 2024, event was thebiggestMendenhall Glacier outburst flood ever measured. The water that rushed out of a breached glacial ice dam brought the river to a record crest of 15.99 feet, inundatingabout 290 homesand stunning much of the community.

“No one expected it to be this big,” Lindoff said months later in an interview at her freshly repaired and refurbished house.

The community is no longer likely to be caught by surprise.

“It’s probably likely that the floods could get larger in the future,” said Eran Hood, an environmental science professor and glacier specialist at the University of Alaska Southeast.

Hood is part of a broad effort mounted by scientists, government agencies, the local Tribal government, nonprofit community groups and individuals to limit the damage that may result from future floods.

A first step is ensuring that the public knows the risks. To that end, Hood and others at UAS and partner organizations have created an online resource, theJuneau Glacial Flood Dashboard,launchedin May.

Though the floods glaciers produce can happen quickly, there can be early warnings of water releases. The Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard gives real-time information on water levels pooled above the ice dam that forms each year at one of the glacier’s basins. It has weather data, aerial images and other up-to-the-minute information. One of the most important features is a detailed flood-inundation map; users can type in their addresses and get predictions for flood impacts, depending on river-level scenarios and other conditions.

The dashboard idea came up as an answer to a basic question, Hood said: “What are the best ways to communicate hazards?”

Lawmakers consider an only-in-Alaska flood insurance program

Work by Hood and his colleagues issupported by a National Science Foundation grant. The foundation funded aprojectto do detailed studies of Mendenhall Glacier and the flood risks it poses, hone systems for predictions and warnings and apply those tools to other flood-prone glaciers in Alaska and possibly beyond.

Outburst flooding is a natural phenomenon in glaciated areas, sometimes referred to by an Icelandic name:jökulhlaup. They occur from the Andes to theArctic. Their suddenness can make them dangerous to people in certain parts of the world, like the Himalayas; overall, about 15 million people in the world are at risk of such floods, according to a 2023studypublished in the journal Nature.

The risks areincreasingwithclimate changeand glacial melt, studies have shown. Globally, glacial lake volume increased by 48% between 1990 and 2018, according to a2020 studyby Canadian, U.S. and British scientists who used satellite imagery to make the calculations.

Glacial outburst floods are also natural in Alaska, though the trends are a bit different.

There were 1,150 of these outbursts released from 106 ice-dammed lakes between 1985 and 2020, according to astudypublished in 2023 by scientists from Colorado State University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks and other institutions. The frequency of such events was unchanged over that period, they found. But there was a big change in timing, with most of the sites flooding earlier in the year, likely the result of warming temperatures and faster melt, the study found. Rapid changes in glaciers’ structures also means that new water-filled dams — and new flood risks — are emerging at individual sites, the study said.

Alaska’s glaciers aremelting fasterthan those elsewhere in the world. The melt has varied and sometimes contradictory impacts on outburst floods, the 2023 study explains. Less ice overall has meant a reduced supply of meltwater. But accelerated melt can also increase the size of glaciers’ basins and weaken the ice dams that hold their meltwater. Rapid melt can also causehuge chunks of iceto calve away from higher elevations into the basins, boosting volume quickly.

Most ofAlaska’s outburst floodshave occurred in remote areas where there are no immediate threats to communities, like parts of sprawlingWrangell St-Elias National Park.

The Mendenhall Valley, however, is not remote.

The broad valley was carved into the landscape over millennia by its namesake glacier. It is a major suburb of Alaska’s capital city, home toabout 12,000of Juneau’s 31,200 residents. It holds neat neighborhoods where houses are more spacious than in the city’s upscale but tightly packed downtown district. It also holds abundant parks and trails, scenic views of mountains, meadows and coastline; and conveniences like shopping malls and commuter bus service. And, within the Tongass National Forest that surrounds the city, the valley is known for the big glacier that looms over it and draws hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.

Mendenhall Glacier has ebbed and flowed over thousands of years, but it has been in retreat ever since the Little Ice Age ended in the mid-1700s. As the climate has warmed — a trend amplified in far-north latitudes — the retreat has accelerated. That is the case not just for Mendenhall but for the other glaciers connected to the vast Juneau Ice Field that caps the mountains spanning Southeast Alaska and adjacent parts of Canada. The Juneau Ice Fieldlost a tenth of its glacier areafrom 2005 to 2019, according to NASA.

Thismeltcreated a relatively new gap within Mendenhall’s ice called Suicide Basin, reportedly named after the drop that ice above the basin would experience. Retreat of the smaller Suicide Glacier, which had been connected to Mendenhall, created the gap.

As glacial ice melts over each summer, the basin fills with water. As the water within the basin rises, it breaks through the ice dam and rushes down into Mendenhall Lake, Mendenhall River and, sometimes, over the riverbanks. The process is repeated year-to-year as ice dams are formed and then breached, though water amounts and speed of releases can vary.

Had modern technology and alertness existed in the past, the risk to the Mendenhall Valley could have been identified many years ago, Hood said.

“Twenty years ago, someone could have looked at Mendenhall and looked at the side basins and said there could definitely be a problem in the future. Nobody did that,” he said.

The first Suicide Basin outburst flood was in 2011. “That pretty much caught people by surprise, although in hindsight, it shouldn’t have,” said Jason Amundson, a UAS geophysics professor and the principal investigator for the National Science Foundation-funded project.

Since then, floods have occurred almost annually, though at varying levels and intensities. Recent floods were big. Arecord 2023 flood, with a maximum crest of the Mendenhall River measured at 14.97 feet, was followed by the even-bigger 2024 flood.

Though it caused more damage, last year’s flood came and went quickly. “The whole thing lasted maybe 12 hours,” Amundson said..

There is not yet enough data to identify a clear pattern, making predictions difficult for now, Hood and Amundson said. But there is a good chance that Suicide Basin will continue emptying out huge amounts of water.

“If we keep having full drainage like we did last year, then I would expect that we would keep having big floods,” Amundson said.

Local officials, meanwhile, are looking beyond Suicide Basin as they consider future risks, said Robert Barr, Juneau’s assistant city manager.

“There very well could be other basins behind Suicide that will form as Mendenhall Glacier retreats,” he said.

The municipal government, a partner in the flood dashboard, has embarked on another short-term response to the flood risk.

It spent nearly $8 million on aflood barriererected this year along the Mendenhall River. The barrier, a stout sandbag structure originally designed for military use, was recommended by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a short-term fix. To recoup part of the cost, the local government is assessing a fee on the 466 property owners in the river area. The fee,about $6,300 per household, is to be paid over 10 years.

The Lindoff home is among those behind the new barrier, which bears the brand name HESCO. Danielle Lindoff, who has watched river waters rise and churn over the years, eroding the far bank and felling huge trees, said she is grateful for the protection. But her feelings are mixed.

“We bought this house because of the view,” she said. “Now we won’t even be able to see it.”

Barr, at the City and Borough of Juneau, concedes the barriers are not particularly pretty. But he said most homeowners accept their presence.

“I wouldn’t say the question was, ‘Do you find the HESCO barriers attractive or not?’” he said. “But they are our best effort, in consultation with the Army Corps and all the other experts that we’re talking with, to keep water in the river.”

The barriers are temporary, Barr said.

For the longer term, the Army Corps of Engineers might design a bigger flood-control system, he said. That could be something as substantial as the diversion project installedin Fairbanksafter a devastating 1967 flood. TheFairbanks systemis large, subject to ongoing maintenance, and has cost $220 million to date. The Corps has already embarked on atechnical studyfor the Mendenhall Valley, a project supported by $4.75 million in federal funds.

Whatever is done will depend on scientific research.

The University of Alaska Southeast-led team, which also includes scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Carnegie Mellon University, is using field and remote-sensing data to better understand how the glacier has changed in the past and to create models for how it will change in the future. Technologies used include LiDAR, which measures elevations and features through light beams; radar, which employs soundwaves to measure the thickness of glacial ice over bedrock; and drones, which capture aerial images that can be compared over time.

Weather and tide data is important, too. The record 2024 outburst flood came on a night after a gloriously sunny and warm summer day. Things could be much worse if an outburst flood happens during a rainstorm or when tides in the adjacent Gastineau Channel are exceptionally high, experts say.

The Mendenhall work being led by Amundson is about more than Juneau’s famous glacier. The risk-analysis systems the team develops for Mendenhall are intended to be applied to other glaciers in Alaska.

Beyond Mendenhall, Hood said, the second-highest priority for risk analysis is probably Snow Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage and just north of the coastal town of Seward.

Though the Snow Glacier’speriodic floodshave not reached communities beyond a popular campground and a smattering of nearby houses, they do threaten infrastructure. The Seward Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and the Alaska Railroad run right along that flood zone. The railroad is planning to raise the elevation of a bridge at the trouble site, and the Alaska Department of Transportation plans a related elevation rise to the highway. The estimated cost of theroad projectalone is $20 million.

Hood and Amundson pointed out another spot where glacial outburst floods are threats: the Prince William Sound port town of Valdez, home to 3,900 people and site of the terminal where oil that passes through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System is shipped out.

In the mountains outside of town, theValdez Glacierhas been damming and releasing meltwater every year or two. Some years, releases are relatively slow and small; some years’ releases cause problems. An outburst flood in 2018 inundated part of Valdez.

Continued work to understand glacial outburst floods and the risks they pose to Alaskans depends on partnerships with academic institutions and agencies at various levels of government.

But federal agencies that are important partners have been weakened by deep budget cuts and abrupt firings that couldhollow out scientific programs.

One partner is the U.S. Geological Survey, a branch of the Department of the Interior that has been doing bothlong-term monitoringof Mendenhall Glacier’s changes and collecting day-to-day data and imagery from Suicide Basin. The Trump administration is proposingslashing total USGS spendingby nearly 40%, including an approximately 30% cut to the agency’s natural disaster programs.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, is another key partner that has already been targeted for deep cuts and likely faces more. The administration’s budget for the coming fiscal years proposes eliminating all funding for NOAA research.

The U.S. Forest Service is another partner. It manages the Tongass National Forest, which covers most of Southeast Alaska, and Southcentral Alaska’s Chugach National Forest. Both are heavily glaciated.

Among the Forest Service duties in Juneau is delivery of warnings and, at times, evacuation notices to tourists and campers at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. Mass firings by the Trump administration left the visitor center nearly unmanned earlier in the year, withonly two employeesstill on the payroll there in February. Several workers have beenrehiredsince, but staffing levels remain uncertain.

Barr said Juneau officials worry about losses at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, an important partner even though its general definition of flood zones does not consider glacial outburst floods.

The agency in Aprilcanceledits Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, and halted work on all pending grant applications, even though the program has wonpraise for helping communitiesreduce costs of disaster emergencies.

Several states are pushing back against the program’s termination; 20 filed alawsuitin mid-July challenging the administration’s decision.

“We are potentially concerned about hazard-mitigation grants and those going away,” Barr said. And along with loss of financial aid is the concern about “losing expertise” as veteran emergency and risk-assessment experts are pushed out of the agency, he said.

Uncertainty also affects the National Science Foundation, which is funding the Mendenhall research project. The Trump administration is proposing a55 percent cutfor the coming fiscal year.

The grant money was already paid, and so far, the project has remained intact, Amundson said. “As far as I know, everything is going forward,” he said.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/voices-arab-press-withdrawal-us-190634384.html,2025-08-02 19:45:00,Voices from the Arab press: Withdrawal of US forces from the region is off the table,"A weekly selection of opinions and analyses from the Arab media around the world.

Asharq Al-Awsat, London, July 25

Amid the turbulent transformations sweeping across the region, debate has once again ignited over the viability of maintaining US military forces in the Middle East, an estimated 40,000 troops stationed across air and naval bases stretching from Syria to the Gulf. This debate has resurfaced in the wake ofrecent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilitiesand growing concerns that Tehran’s potential retaliation could place American personnel in harm’s way.

Yet, influential voices within the military and intelligence communities in Washington continue to argue that a precipitous withdrawal would jeopardize vital US interests and create dangerous vacuums ripe for exploitation by hostile powers or terrorist groups. The recent departure of the aircraft carrierUSSCarl Vinsonfrom the region – while the USSNimitzremains – suggests not a full-scale pullout but a calculated repositioning.

Adm. Brad Cooper, who recently assumed command of US Central Command (CENTCOM), has stated unequivocally that no plans are in place for a sweeping withdrawal. Instead, the force posture remains subject to ongoing review based on field conditions.

Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cooper confirmed that “the approach today is a conditions-based assessment,” emphasizing his commitment to reassessing force levels and their geographic distribution in real time. His remarks emphasize the military’s view that its land, air, and naval assets in the region remain central to America’s ability to respond swiftly to emerging threats.

Recent history reinforces the notion that Middle East crises erupt with such regularity that ignoring them is not a viable option – from the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran to Houthi threats in the Red Sea, from ongoing instability in Iraq and Syria to persistent threats in the Strait of Hormuz.

Gen. Frank McKenzie, who led US forces in the region from 2019 to 2022, has argued that “maintaining a measured military presence serves US interests and provides countries in the region with an additional element of stability in the face of threats.” His assessment, rooted in years of firsthand experience, warns that any abrupt departure would erode Washington’s deterrence credibility and strain vital security partnerships. But this is not merely a defensive posture.

US forces in the region are tasked with safeguarding maritime navigation through strategic chokepoints, such as the Strait of Hormuz, and ensuring the uninterrupted flow of global energy supplies. They also play a pivotal role in counterterrorism efforts, particularly as reports surface of Islamic State cells reconstituting in vulnerable areas.

As McKenzie put it, “The war against ISIS is not over,” stressing that while US troops are not directly leading combat operations, they provide indispensable support to local partners on the ground. In this context, America’s military footprint functions as both a deterrent and an anchor of regional stability.

Sen. Angus King of Maine, who recently visited Iraq, offered further firsthand insights reflecting how local allies value the American presence. He relayed that Iraqi officials view US troops as a necessary counterbalance to the aggression of Iranian-backed militias, especially amid the political volatility surrounding upcoming elections.

“American forces are viewed as a stabilizing force at this critical time,” King noted. While critics highlight the high costs of maintaining the military presence, some estimates put it above $20 billion annually, many defense analysts argue that the price tag pales in comparison to the cost of a security vacuum that could invite the influence of adversarial states or extremist actors.

Sources within the Pentagon confirm that regional allies, such as Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, remain committed to their defense arrangements with Washington and view American forces as a reliable bulwark against sudden crises.

Although the notion of replacing fixed bases with agile naval and air units has theoretical appeal, it runs up against the operational reality that rapid deployment and effective joint missions require established logistical hubs. Some defense planners are open to reevaluating the distribution of bases and reallocating forces, but few believe the region has become any less reliant on a US military presence.

The broader geopolitical calculus cannot be ignored either: US security officials acknowledge that while shifting strategic focus toward Asia is imperative, it does not warrant abandoning the Middle East, which has long been a theater of global power rivalry. A withdrawal without a robust, well-structured alternative risks ceding influence to Russia, China, or Iran.

As long as the region remains plagued by recurring and unpredictable crises, maintaining a flexible, responsive US military posture appears far more pragmatic than idealistic calls for a full retreat. Ultimately, the dominant view among senior American military and national security leaders is that “security cannot be achieved in a vacuum,” and that a deliberate, sustainable presence is a far safer bet than the costly mistake of retreat, only to return later under far worse conditions. –Huda al-Husseini

An-Nahar, Lebanon, July 25

There has been growing talk of a “New Middle East” emerging from the upheavals and shifting dynamics that have shaped the region over the past two years, amid speculation that more Arab countries will join the Abraham Accords to normalize relations with Israel.

These agreements are expected to yield political and economic dividends for the entire region and the United States, while also bolstering the West’s strategic position against China and Russia.

But a fundamental question remains: does Israel truly want to end the state of war and demilitarize its society? Israel’s conduct across multiple fronts casts doubt on its commitment to peace. The devastation in Gaza, along with widespread displacement and destruction in the West Bank, suggests a systematic attempt to bury the two-state solution.

Meanwhile, on its northern front, Israel wages ongoing military operations in Lebanon under the banner of disarming Hezbollah, whileescalating its strikes in Syriaunder shifting justifications – whether it’s combating terrorism, establishing a buffer zone, or defending minorities.

The confrontation with Iran, for its part, was paused not by mutual agreement or surrender, but by a directive from President Donald Trump. Yet the risk of escalation remains, particularly as Israel continues to warn of renewed conflict if Tehran advances its nuclear enrichment and missile programs.

The Iranian regime, far from defeated, remains active in rebuilding its regional network of proxy forces, including Hezbollah and the Houthis. As such, Israel’s multiple wars have yet to produce a resolution on any of the seven fronts it claims to be engaged in.

So, does Israel genuinely seek peace with its Arab neighbors? Should such agreements materialize, it would imply Israeli acceptance of a framework that endorses the two-state solution, recognizes peace and stability along its borders, and opens the door to joint investment and trade initiatives through normalization.

In such a scenario, the existential fear that has long defined Israeli society would be defused, potentially shifting public preference toward economic growth and development over military spending. The influence of Israel’s right wing, which thrives on fear and the perception of external threat, would likely diminish. Even more transformative, the country’s political power structure, which military figures have historically dominated since the state’s founding, could shift toward greater civilian and business leadership.

Yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right religious coalition appear determined to prolong the conflict, as several Israeli and Western reports, including a recentNew York Timesinvestigation, have indicated. Their political strategy hinges on reinforcing existential anxiety, particularly in the wake of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attacks, to galvanize support ahead of legislative elections.

But can leaders whose political survival depends on perpetuating fear and conflict truly pursue peace? Within Israel, opposition figures have voiced support for a two-state solution and for seizing the opportunity to make peace with regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Syria – moves that could usher in a new era of regional stability. Yet these voices remain sidelined, lacking the political power to shift policy. As a result, Israel’s right-wing leadership will continue to seek out or sustain an adversary to justify high defense budgets and preserve the military’s central role in the national economy.

With current military campaigns still unresolved, it remains unclear who Israel will identify as its next enemy. There is a possibility that it will choose not to end any of its ongoing conflicts definitively, preferring instead to keep a target – whether Iran, with its expanding missile arsenal; Hezbollah, still entrenched in Lebanon; or perhaps a new adversary in Syria – at arm’s reach, to strike periodically and sustain the narrative that underpins its national security doctrine. –Riad Kahwaji

Al-Ittihad, UAE, July 26

Hamas is now confronting the most perilous phase of its existence in the Gaza Strip, having shifted from a dominant force to a beleaguered entity hemmed in by internal tribal dynamics and sustained military pressure. Its support from Iran appears increasingly uncertain, as its operational capabilities deteriorate and its leadership hierarchy fragments, despite the efforts of the current leader, Izz al-Din al-Haddad, to reorganize the movement.

Meanwhile, the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) is moving to replicate the Rafah-based model ofYasser Abu Shabab’s militia by recruiting similar groups in northern Gaza and in key border zones. This is part of a broader strategy to dismantle Hamas’s governance infrastructure – its administrative, service, and security functions – and to prepare the ground for a potential phased Israeli withdrawal.

The Israeli military is actively studying the expansion of this model to additional areas of the Strip before reconfiguring existing security arrangements. The Israeli government has publicly announced its plan to arm various militias within Gaza in a bid to sow chaos and confront Hamas, a move that signals its intent to press forward regardless of criticism surrounding the Abu Shabab model’s shortcomings.

Despite mounting concerns about the plan’s effectiveness, it continues to receive the backing of Israel’s security agencies, particularly the Shin Bet, and remains under the patronage of Prime Minister Netanyahu. At its core, the Israeli approach reflects a belief that removing Hamas requires the emergence of a viable alternative authority.

The political leadership has rejected top-down solutions, whether from the Palestinian Authority or a proposed multinational force, and is instead pursuing a bottom-up solution rooted in on-the-ground realities. Netanyahu’s stance underscores a clear objective: to exclude both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority from any future governance arrangement in Gaza. Under the proposed plan, the Israeli military would occupy and “cleanse” strategic areas in Gaza before transferring authority to Bedouin militias supplied with arms, personnel, and decision-making power.

This process is being implemented in stages, beginning in zones that have already been cleared and are under complete Israeli control. Should it succeed, the model would be extended to other regions. In Shejaia and Khan Yunis,Israel has begun arming factionsled by Yasser Hnaidek and Rami Helles, both members of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah), who are now active with direct Israeli military support.

These figures receive salaries from the Palestinian Authority, as well as weapons and humanitarian assistance from Israel. One faction operates in Gaza City’s Shejaia neighborhood, while the other is active in Khan Yunis in the south, both areas currently under heavy Israeli military presence as part of the ongoing operation.

Notably, Helles hails from a family that has long been antagonistic toward Hamas, dating back to 2007. The developments in Gaza echo previous Israeli efforts to cultivate internal collaborators, reminiscent of the Palestinian Village Leagues in the West Bank or the South Lebanon Army during the occupation of southern Lebanon.

However, despite robust Israeli backing, this strategy is encountering growing public resistance, raising the prospect of failure much like earlier attempts. On the ground, Hamas no longer exercises centralized control in Gaza. It now issues only general directives to its remaining fighters to endure for as long as possible, while contending with an internal tribal revolt and overt Israeli support for rival tribal leaders and militias. These tribes, for their part, claim they are safeguarding humanitarian aid convoys and attempting to establish a new administrative framework to replace Hamas’s crumbling rule.

In this evolving power struggle, local armed actors have become pivotal players, and Israel appears to be collaborating with them to erode Hamas’ grip. The formation of these security factions, regardless of their political affiliation, has disrupted Hamas’ military wing, particularly amid worsening internal communication between the organization’s military hierarchy and its central leadership in Gaza.

As the situation becomes increasingly complex, several scenarios for Gaza’s future are being proposed. One involves an international force overseeing the territory, though this idea appears flawed due to its lack of administrative viability for Palestinians. Another proposal envisions a joint international-Arab administration, comprising Arab and Palestinian representatives, which could pave the way for the Palestinian Authority’s return to governance. A third suggestion calls for an independent civil administration to manage Gaza’s affairs.

Yet all of these proposals remain speculative and unresolved, with the eventual outcome likely to be determined by shifts in the balance of power on the ground, a picture that is still taking shape.– Tarek Fahmy

Al-Ahram, Egypt, July 24

At the outset ofthe fifth Gaza War, a pressing question emerged: What is Israel’s plan for the day after it achieves its declared objectives of recovering hostages, decimating Gaza, and eliminating Hamas? Will it reoccupy the territory? Will it act out of territorial ambition, seeking to displace Palestinians in favor of expanding settlements?

While some answers have surfaced through official statements and unfolding events, they have yet to coalesce into a coherent strategy for ending the war and building a peace in which Israel no longer lives under the threat of perpetual conflict. On the contrary, the war has widened, drawing in Iran, the Red Sea, the Syrian Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon.

At times, discussions around the “day after” have shifted toward the United States, particularly following President Trump’s historic visit to the Gulf and the subsequent discourse around expanding the Abraham Accords, alongside tentative steps toward the idea of a Palestinian state. However, today, the lines between war and diplomacy have become increasingly blurred, with peace negotiations unfolding against a backdrop of escalating military tensions and political coercion.

What is critical now is the recognition that the “day after” must not be treated as an exclusively Israeli or American initiative. It must be a collective regional effort, involving Arab nations, particularly those that have already signed peace agreements with Israel or are on the path toward normalization, and who share an interest in advancing regional development and long-term stability.

Allowing Israel or the United States to monopolize the postwar agenda risks perpetuating cycles of violence and expanding the scope of future conflict to include volatile issues such as the Iranian nuclear program, thereby locking the region into a state of war for years to come.

The essential task ofthe Arab “day after”is to safeguard Palestinian presence on the land and to prevent any form of ethnic cleansing or large-scale violence. Other regional battles or strategic distractions must not dilute this mission.

What we are witnessing, and have witnessed throughout this conflict, is that many have yet to fully comprehend the true nature of the current war, let alone learn from the patterns of past wars. More alarmingly, there remains a profound lack of engagement with the history and nuances of peace-building efforts, whether warm and active or cold and detached.

This moment demands deep reflection and strategic clarity from the Arab world, especially from those nations already affected by the ongoing war and those that will inevitably be shaped by the contours of the peace that may emerge, not just from Gaza or Ramallah, but even from faraway capitals like Baku. –Abdel Moneim Saeed

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/her-nomination-head-blm-ended-024604868.html,2025-08-03 04:00:00,Her nomination to head the BLM ended abruptly. Here’s how she would have approached the job,"Just two hours before her Senate hearing to become the next director of the Bureau of Land Management, Kathleen Sgamma received a call from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. She was loading into a car with her family to drive to the Capitol when he told her that she needed to withdraw her nomination.

Sgamma toldE&E News by Politicoabout the exchange this past May. Burgum, she explained to the reporter, “basically told me that I had failed vetting.”

The reason Burgum gave wasa leaked memoSgamma wrote to oil and gas executives following the Jan. 6 attack on the capitol. “I am disgusted by the violence witnessed yesterday and President Trump’s role in spreading misinformation that incited it,” she wrote.

“We must listen to and accept others whom we disagree with, even when they don’t return that respect,” she wrote. “By making this effort individually and together as citizens, we may eventually get political leaders who better reflect the ideals of our nation.”

Prior to the BLM nomination, Sgamma — a Buffalo, New York, native — was the president of the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade organization that advocates for extractive industries in the Intermountain West, where she had worked for 20 years.

A graduate of MIT and Virginia Tech with several years of experience as a U.S. Army intelligence officer, Sgamma described herself as someone with a “natural proclivity for public lands.”

Where that proclivity often produces conservationists, Sgamma “took the road less traveled,” becoming a staunch oil, gas and natural resources advocate. She often testified in Congress on behalf of her clients, and was a feature in court cases over National Environmental Protection Act reviews that impacted the companies she represented. Sgamma was also a named contributor toProject 2025’s section on the Department of the Interior.

Four years after she wrote that memo, Sgamma’s bid to join the administration of the same political leader she wrote was “discredited” came to a rather abrupt end. She is “still disappointed” about how things worked out, but reiterated that “if there was any bitterness it’s completely gone now, that’s for sure.”

The Deseret News recently spoke with her about the priorities for public land management, renewables, the Bundy family, public land sales, and how the BLM can get its authority and trust back. The discussion has been edited for length and clarity.

Deseret News: What were your priorities then and what do you think are the biggest issues facing the Bureau of Land Management now?

KS:My priorities are what I think are the biggest issues facing the BLM. First and foremost, the priority is the unleashing of American energy. Obviously that’s a priority of the president, so that would have been my priority. I thought the secretarial order, “Unleashing American Energy” — with the laundry list of things that needed to get done — is spot on.

The other priority is to figure out how to get NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) done in a timely manner, that’s legally defensible. Congress passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act that (stipulated) NEPA should be done within two years, and it should be a reasonable page limit.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act helps to insulate the bureau in court when it comes to our RMPs (resource management plans). They don’t have to be science projects, they don’t have to be years-long research projects. We’ve seen judges flyspeck BLM NEPA in the past (flyspeck in a legal context means to pay meticulous, close attention to minute details while seeking flaws) and Congress has clearly said, ‘Nope — it’s to look at environmental impacts that are of approximate cause and it is to get it done in a reasonable time, so that we can make it in America.’

Then, thirdly, is to leave the land better than we found it. Continue to make progress on reducing invasive species, to reduce fuel load to handle wildfires better. Can we do something about wild horses so they’re not ripping up the range and crowding out native species?

DN:What do you think the role of regulation plays for the BLM? It can be a contentious part of land management, and so I’m curious to understand how you navigate that tension with NEPA or regulation otherwise.

KS:I kind of glazed over it with my first priority which is unleashing American energy. In that secretarial order was quite a bit about permitting, so BLM needs to get to regular order on permitting not just for oil and gas but also for ranchers.

They need an update to their permitting rule. We shouldn’t be putting ranchers in that uncertainty of not knowing if they’re going to get their grazing permits renewed every 10 years. So regularity for all kinds of different regulations is absolutely necessary at the BLM.

DN:One of the places that struggles the most with regulation is renewable energy — geothermals in Utah, for example. What do you think is the role of renewables in releasing America’s energy future?

KS:There are certain areas with geothermal resources and we should be able to develop those as well — we’ve got some great resources in Utah and Nevada and all across the West. Permitting should be certain and it should be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time when looking at renewables, as well as critical minerals which are absolutely essential for renewables and also a whole host of other applications as well.

There was a critical minerals mine that took 19 years to get through the NEPA. That is ridiculous. We know how to do mining. We know how to mitigate the impacts from mining. Modern mining is done in a way that is protective of the environment and so that should take a couple of years, not 19.

DN:How about wind and solar? There are complaints that, in an effort to push extractive leases, the current administration is putting restrictions on other renewable energy sources.

KS:Well, there should be certainty for all kinds of different energy sources. The thing about wind and solar is that they take up a huge amount of land for very little energy. So we saw in the previous administration and the Obama administration, that they favored renewables — wind and solar — over oil and gas.

They put more resources there and wind and solar don’t return any revenue to them. Oil and gas do. (The Biden and Obama administrations) fast-tracked their NEPA (reviews) and completely ignored the impact of mines. They completely ignored the impact on birds and other wildlife.

Not completely, I mean wildlife held up — desert animals, particularly, with solar — but they would downplay it. So the permitting and NEPA for renewables should recognize the impacts. It shouldn’t be favored over oil and gas. It should be a balance.

DN:In terms of unleashing America’s energy potential, do you think considerations should be made for the impacts of burning fossil fuels and how that affects the climate?

KS:Well, I think we’ve gotten past this notion that we can just get rid of fossil fuels and then climate change will be solved. We don’t have alternatives that do everything that oil, gas and coal do. In the absence of actual alternatives that are 24/7 reliable, that don’t chew up the land, don’t take up so much mining — we can’t even mine enough to completely replace oil gas and coal with renewables — it’s a pipe dream to think that we can replace everything with wind and solar. That’s just not how it works.

DN:Do you think there’s a way for the future of the BLM to find a middle ground between those who prioritize conservation and those who prioritize natural resource extraction?

KS:That is BLM’s lot in life. It is the red-headed stepchild of the federal land management agencies. Everybody loves the park service and we lock away national parks, and that’s a clear preservationist agenda.

But BLM has a multiple-use agenda, and it does have to balance those multiple uses. It has to balance conservation with productive uses on appropriate working landscapes. It will never please everybody. It will always have people screaming at it, but that’s just the nature of multiple-use lands. You have to have a thick skin.

DN:In your estimation, what is the highest and best use of our public lands?

KS:Well, the highest and best use depends on the area you’re talking about. Obviously, the highest and best use of Arches National Park is preservation only. The highest and best use of the Uinta Basin is for oil and natural gas development, because it’s a huge resource. So it depends on the area you’re in, what your highest and best use is.

DN:What about the areas whose use cases are unclear and also hyper-contentious, such as Bears Ears or Grand Staircase?

KS:That’s a great example of why when you decree something from on high without a public process — national monuments are decreed by the president — that’s when you get the most conflict. President Clinton (did) Grand Staircase-Escalante behind everybody’s back without notifying Utah because he knew that those on the ground would oppose that action.

The Antiquities Act designations don’t require any NEPA review — it’s the only major federal action on public lands that don’t require NEPA. So they don’t go through any kind of public input process. Then you get those contentious issues like with Bears Ears and Grand Staircase. It’s perpetual. It never goes away.

DN:Who are the best stewards of public lands?

KS:Ultimately, private landholders always take care of their land better than federal bureaucrats, flat out. We know that private forests are managed better than the Forest Service, for example.

That doesn’t mean there aren’t really well-managed forests or really well-managed parts of the BLM surface estate. But federal agencies are perpetually underfunded; they never have enough. And when you own something, you take better care of it.

Private entities, then those closest to it. Those at the county and at the state level are closer to the land than the federal bureaucracy is.

The good thing about the BLM is that most of its employees are out West. You have very dedicated land managers who are also close to the ground and do a great job of managing land under the constraints that they have. But transferring lands to states … whenever it’s suggested, you get apoplectic responses.

I would put that in that order: private, then those closest to the ground and then — kind of as a last resort, just because there’s so much public land — would be the federal government.

DN:How did you feel about the controversial efforts made by the Senate and House natural resources committees to introduce land sales into the reconciliation bill?

KS:Well, it’s back to my earlier comment about how apoplectic people get when you talk about transferring any lands to the states. What’s being talked about is transfers for purposes of housing around Las Vegas, for example, or other areas like St. George that are constrained by federal lands.

Let’s not get apoplectic. Every single acre of BLM lands or federal lands is not Yellowstone. If there are some lands where the better and higher use is to support a community with affordable housing or infrastructure, then let’s take a step back. It’s not the end of the world. Lands are still protected. Wilderness areas are still protected.

DN:Using public lands for affordable housing — how reasonable do you think that is?

KS:It’s a small amount that we’re talking about. If it’s millions and millions and tens of millions of acres, that’s one thing. But if it’s a reasonable amount of land in an area that’s appropriate — it’s already near development, it’s not off in the middle of nowhere — then, again, let’s be reasonable about it.

That’s the thing about federal lands, right? Unless it’s a presidential decree of tens of millions of acres like the Antiquities Act, every single acre on BLM goes through a land-use planning process. Any decision goes through NEPA. So you have to look at the impacts locally, on the ground and look at, what acre are we talking about? Where is it? What’s the multiple use in the area? What are the other natural resource values in the area that need to be protected?

It’s a very painstaking process and it’s done deliberately. And you have to give BLM a lot of credit for doing that hard work and taking those bullets constantly.

DN:Speaking of taking bullets, there’s been a lot of reporting about how the Bundy family standoff showed that the BLM could not enforce its own rules. Do you think there’s a way for the bureau to recover some of its credibility?

KS:The Bundy standoff was one of these situations where BLM employees weren’t supported necessarily. The Bundys certainly felt like they were getting a poor shake. In certain communities, it will never recover.

But let’s face it, the federal government instigated that situation by pushing ranchers. The Fish and Wildlife Service and BLM had some overzealous federal employees. You had environmental groups trying to push out ranching and using the federal government to do that. The Bundys were particularly stubborn and the Bundys did not handle it very well and, ultimately, stepped way over the line.

When there is that resource conflict, you have to build trust with people. You have to bring everybody to the table. You have to listen to all sides. You have to do the hard work of working with all stakeholders, no matter how thorny they may be.

DN:In cases where those stakeholders threaten violence?

KS:Well, the Bundys clearly overstepped their bounds and they were punished for it accordingly. But the federal government overstepped its bounds too. A federal bureaucracy that stays in its lane, that follows the law, that is not overzealous, that fairly balances competing interests … you have to show all stakeholders that you’re listening to everyone, that you’re taking their input into consideration and not trying to push them off the land, so that when you have to make those thorny decisions that are not going to satisfy everyone, you have a record of having done it the right way.

DN:You believe that conservation and natural resource extraction go hand in hand?

KS:Oh, absolutely. Because we have areas that are preserved — hundreds of millions of acres of wilderness and national parks, and there’s no development there. But we also have hundreds of millions of acres of working landscapes that contributed to the wealth of the nation.

It’s a false choice that we can either have conservation or we can develop our resources. We can and we do both: we develop our natural resources and we protect the land.

It’s a balance. It’s not either or. Is there an impact? Absolutely. There’s an impact from oil, gas, coal, wind, solar, agriculture, but we mitigate it. We reduce the risk that accidents happen or we make sure that we keep the impact as low as possible, that we manage those risks.

We provide an energy resource that not only powers America, but enables the world to be successful."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mexican-city-had-one-worlds-100000710.html,2025-08-03 11:15:00,This Mexican city had one of the world's highest homicide rates — so it fired most of its police,"On a sunny spring day last year, a young attorney named Gisela Gaytán kicked off her campaign for mayor in this gritty Mexican city.

Under her blouse she wore a ballistic vest.

Celaya had become the epicenter of a bloody cartel war, with one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and a local police force that appeared powerless to stop it.

“We must recover the security that we so long for,” Gaytán, 38, wrote on social media before setting out that day.

As she shook hands at an event on the outskirts of town, a man approached, raised a gun and shot her in the head.

After her funeral, where a priest lamented “a death caused by murderers who believe they control society,” local Morena party leaders picked a new candidate: Juan Miguel Ramírez Sánchez, a bespectacled former university rector who had worked on Gaytán's campaign.

Ramírez believed that one of Celaya's most urgent problems was its police, who instead of fighting organized crime appeared to be involved in it.

His son-in-law had been killed in a case that was still unsolved, and officers had demanded bribes and obstructed the investigation. Police misconduct was well documented: Local cops were prosecuted for abusing detainees and participating in kidnappings and even homicides.

Ramírez won the election. And in his first act as mayor, he fired 340 of the roughly 600 officers on the force. Then — as officials across Mexico have been doing for nearly two decades now — he called in federal troops.

Mexican President Felipe Calderón first deployed soldiers into the streets to fight drug traffickers in 2006, promising then that the military would stay only until police could be reformed.

In the years since, leaders across the political spectrum have repeatedly vowed to better train and root out corruption among the country's cops — a step that security experts agree is essential to reducing crime and violence.

But with the exception of Mexico's capital and a few other major cities, those efforts have lost steam. Officials have slashed funding for state and local police forces, and disbanded the federal police altogether. Cops continue to be near-universally reviled, with federal surveys showing that 9 out of 10 Mexicans don't trust the police.

At the same time, Mexico has vastly expanded the military's role in public security. There are now more soldiers, marines and members of the national guard deployed nationally than state and local police officers, according to an analysis by the Citizen Security Program at the Universidad Iberoamericana. In most parts of the country, there are fewer state and local police today than there were when the drug war began in 2006.

""The police have been abandoned in favor of militarization,"" said Ernesto López Portillo, a researcher who leads the Iberoamericana program.

There is little evidence that the strategy has worked. Homicides remain persistently high, although they have dipped slightly in recent years. And cartels have only expanded their reach, with a U.S. military analysis finding that criminal groups control more than one-third of Mexico.

Yet officials continue to embrace militarization as the country's primary security strategy. That even includes leftists who once fiercely warned of the dangers of ceding public security to soldiers, includingPresident Claudia Sheinbaumand her predecessor,Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

The mayor's abrupt decision to summarily replace most of the police force in Celaya, a patchwork of farmland and factories in central Guanajuato state, is a case study in why Mexicans have lost faith in local law enforcement — and what happens when soldiers take over.

Celaya used to be a tranquil city. Its location along a highway and railroad that stretch 600 miles to the United States drew Honda and other automakers to build plants here.

For years, a local criminal group called theSanta Rosa de Limacartel quietly stole fuel from the major oil pipelines that cross the region.

It wasn't until the notoriousJalisco New Generation Carteledged in several years ago that violence exploded. The groups battled for control of pipelines but also drug trafficking, extortion rackets and theft of cargo trucks.

Celaya became synonymous with violence as criminals gunned down shopkeepers who refused to pay extortion fees, drug users who couldn't pay their dealers and everyday citizens who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They carried out massacres at hotels, bars and even funerals.

By 2024, Celaya had a homicide rate of 87 killings per 100,000 people — 17 times the rate in the United States.

It had long been clear that the city's police force was, at best, not up to the challenge — and, at worst, deeply corrupt.

The 600 cops on the force in Celaya, which has a population of around half a million, were half of the 1,200 that the United Nations recommends for a city of its size. Officers were poorly trained and badly paid.

That made them easy targets for criminals who offered cash in exchange for intelligence, muscle or simply looking the other way when a crime was committed. When police didn't cooperate — or didn't cooperate correctly — they were often killed.

In 2024, a cop here was 400 times more likely to be killed than one in the United States.

Fanny Ramírez, the daughter of a street vendor and a maid, was 21 when she enrolled in Celaya’s police academy. After eight years with the force, she earned just $900 a month, little more than a worker on an assembly line. Her boyfriend was also a police officer in Celaya.

Fanny warned her family to steer clear of the cops, said her sister, Elisabeth. After Elisabeth’s husband witnessed a triple homicide several years ago, Fanny instructed him: “Go inside and say you don’t know anything.”

“The police are supposed to take care of you,” Elisabeth said. “But here, we have to protect ourselves from the police.”

Mayor Ramírez wasn't the first local politician to try to clean house. Previous leaders had made a show of purging dozens or even hundreds of police officers that they claimed were rotten.

But with most mayors serving just a single three-year term and scant public funds, reform efforts gained no traction. Experts say change takes time and requires concrete action to raise salaries, improve recruitment criteria and strengthen oversight.

On the national level, the approach to policing was inconsistent. Before he was elected president in 2018, López Obrador criticized his predecessors for replacing police with soldiers.

""We can’t use the military to make up for the civilian government’s shortcomings,"" López Obrador insisted, vowing to send soldiers ""back to their barracks.""

On taking office, he changed his tune. Facing record high homicide rates, he released a security plan that argued that taking soldiers off the streets would be “disastrous” because cops were “controlled by organized crime and moved by self-interest and corruption.”

He dismantled the federal police, a famously corrupt force whose longtime leaderwas convictedin the U.S. of taking bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.

And López Obrador steered money once destined for local and state law enforcement to create a 120,000-officer-strong national guard, a force he vowed would be “incorruptible"" and civilian-led, and which was supposed to take over the investigative functions of the federal police.

In fact, nearly 90% of the members of the national guard are former soldiers, and few have been trained to carry out investigations.

In Celaya, violence continued to spiral. And policing never improved.

Last year, about a month before the mayoral candidate was cut down with bullets, Fanny set out to drop her 6-year-old daughter off at child care before starting work. She was driving a sedan that belonged to her boyfriend.

Assailants opened fire. She and her daughter died on the spot. A few months later, Fanny's boyfriend was gunned down, too.

Neither case has been solved, but Fanny's sister believes the deaths were connected to the boyfriend's ties to organized crime.

Shortly after he was elected mayor in June 2024, Ramírez said he was approached by cartel members who asked for positions in his government. He said he rebuffed them, but was shaken.

""I've been afraid like all citizens,"" he said.

He met with Mexico's top public security official and told her he had no confidence in Celaya's police. ""Not all of them were bad,"" he said recently, ""but most were."" She pledged to send him 500 members of the national guard.

The mayor's mass firing of police faced criticism from his political opponents.

Mauro González Martínez, the top security official in Guanajuato state, a former federal police officer and member of an opposition party, said national guard troops and other members of the armed forces were not equipped to fight crime.

""The army is trained for war,"" he said in an interview. ""A police officer investigates. A soldier kills.""

Nancy Angélica Canjura Luna, an analyst at a think tank called Causa en Comun, said that while soldiers are seen as less corruptible than police because they typically come from other parts of the country, that means they know little about the region they are supposed to be protecting.

“They are always new,"" she said. ""They don't know the criminal dynamics and they don't know the territory itself.”

But others in Celaya, exhausted by years of violence, welcomed the troops and two high-ranking military officers loaned to the city to lead its new security force as a show of strength.

Army Col. Pablo Muñoz Huitrón and Lt. Col. Bernardo Cajero rode into town in an armed convoy, dressed in camouflage fatigues. As they strode into City Hall, they were flanked by soldiers.

Muñoz was quickly sworn in as Celaya's secretary of public security, a role traditionally occupied by civilians, but which in many cities is now filled by current or former soldiers or marines. Cajero was tasked with leading the officers who had survived the purge and the guardsman who now worked alongside them.

When Cajero switched from his olive green army fatigues to a blue police uniform, he was startled by how differently people treated him.

""My first realization was how much people hate the police,"" he said.

The pair, who had served in cartel hot spots like Tamaulipas and Michoacán, devised a plan. The city's remaining police would patrol alongside members of the military to reduce opportunities for corruption.

Security forces would focus on improving response times for 911 calls and increasing the number of checkpoints around the city to make sure drivers weren't carrying guns or drugs.

Celaya's leaders say crime rates have fallen.

Between January and June, there were 158 homicides in the city, according to the local government, down from 257 during the same time last year.

But high-profile acts of violence continue.

Cajero was patrolling on a recent night when the radio crackled with a report of a homicide. His convoy raced to an intersection where a taxi lay overturned. The driver had been shot. His 12-year-old daughter, who had been in the passenger seat, survived but was in shock.

“Take me to my father,” she wailed as a paramedic tended to her wounds.

Earlier this year, the mayor's bodyguard was shot to death outside his own home. Ramírez, who cries while remembering him, said the perpetrators were likely criminals angry about his new security plan. ""Obviously it was to send me a message,"" Ramírez said.

Some locals have bristled at the presence of federal forces in their streets. Alejandro, a 24-year-old Uber driver who did not give his last name because of fear of reprisals, said he had been stopped frequently by national guard members, and treated as roughly as by police while they reviewed his car and identity. ""They're all the same,"" he said.

This summer, 11 members of the national guard were charged with theft after they were caught extracting fuel from an illegal tap not far from Celaya.

""How can we trust people who are robbing from us?"" Alejandro said. ""That's not logical.""

Sheinbaum won the presidency last year in part on a promise to replicate the security strategy she had embraced as mayor of Mexico City, which focused on improving investigations, professionalizing cops and implementing community policing models developed in U.S. cities such as Oakland. But as president she has taken few steps toward police reform, and she recently pushed a constitutional amendment that puts the national guard permanently under military control.

The lack of federal help has made it challenging for Celaya's efforts to rebuild its police force.

On a recent afternoon at the city's aging police academy, young officers rappelled down walls and simulated hand-to-hand combat. They practiced wielding guns but not actually shooting them because the cost of bullets was too high.

One recent graduate, 29-year-old Jose Francisco Hernández Herrera, decided to join the police after his brother, a merchant, was killed by criminals.

Hernández said instructors rarely discussed how police should handle bribery offers from organized crime, even if it may be only a matter of time before he is approached.

""You're never 100% prepared,"" he said, adding that he would refuse to cooperate for his brother's memory, and because he wants his son to live in a city where he can trust police. ""If you really want to change your society, you have to make the right decision, even if it's the more complicated one.""

Ramírez has touted young officers like Hernández as the future of Celaya. But the academy is graduating fewer than 20 officers a month, and is struggling to recruit new officers. Pay starts at just $800 a month.

Recently, the city put out a call to current and former soldiers, asking them to take jobs on the force.

For over a month now, President Donald Trump has faced increasing pressure over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who authorities say died by suicide in a federal jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The unexpected re-emergence of the Epstein scandal — which is largely due to the Trump administration’s abrupt pivot after promising transparency on the case and its files — has caused a sustained media fury, a rather unique phenomenon in the Trump era. And that seems to be Silver’s main gripe.

Arguing that the scandal is not “6-stories-every-day-newsworthy,” he claimed “the feeding frenzy around Epstein has caused some political junkies to forget that Trump is often impervious to consequences.” To make his point, Silver said the entire saga reminds him of the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, a topic to which the Trump administration has been desperate to divert  the media’s attention:

In the way the Epstein story has hijacked the news cycle, and with the constant predictions of spiraling damage to Trump’s political standing, it reminds me of another story that lent itself to episodic coverage: Russiagate.

It’s hard to overstate the extent to which every minor Russia-related revelation in the story made news in 2017 and 2018, completelytaking over the Rachel Maddow Show, for instance, from its formerly more policy-wonkish past.Liberals wereliterally selling prayer candleslabeled “pee tape” showing Robert Mueller as a saint-like figure, convinced that the walls were caving in around Trump. Facebook ads from Russian bot farms that made up an infinitesimal fraction of the content voters were consuming in 2016 wereblown upinto a huge scandal.

I’ll assert that Russiagate didn’t end well for Democrats, but I’ll admit that’s hard to prove. Trump’s approval rating did decline significantly in 2017 — more steeply than so far in his second term — and Democrats did have a pretty good 2018 midterm. What I think is clearer is that the obsessive coverage of the case probably insulated Trump from moreserious scandals that came along later.

Trying to turn the Epstein playbook back on Trump’s critics serves to blunt righteous criticism that the Epstein Files are completelyupending online spaceswhere young men, a key demographic of Trump supporters, talk— spaces the mainstream media have no control over. The president, for his part, appears to understand the authenticity of the anger better than Silver. So he’s downplayed concerns about Epstein, calling some of his supporters “weaklings” for buying into what he sold them for years. He repeatedly tells his base to move on. Some are listening. “Among Republicans, Trump’s approval has actually ticked up a point since Epstein became a focal point, while his disapproval rating has declined by one point,” Silver concluded in his analysis.

Butseveralof his most prominentsupportersare not. And seemingly every hour, there’s a steady drip ofinformationkeeping the media spotlight on the scandal. That’s why Trump’s tactics of diversion and distraction have grown so desperate.

Case in point: Earlier this week, many of the president’s most ardent QAnon supporters — a group ostensibly committed to a project holding elites they imagine are guilty of child predation accountable — publicly abandoned him, includingQAnon Shaman Jacob Chansley, who was infamous for storming the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a horned fur hat while exposing his bare chest. After losing their support, a Media Matters analysisfoundthat Trump amplified QAnon conspiracy theories on Truth Social14 times in one daythis week. As the organization’s president Angelo Carusone explained to MSNBC’s Nicole Wallace, Trump is “trying to get those QAnon people to believe that somehow he’s playing fifth-dimensional chess and that there’s something he’s going to do. He’s going to give them accountability soon.”

Despite Silver’s suggestion the president has not lost support, polling this week has showna noticeable Epstein-related dipfor Trump and his handling of the scandal.

A round ofrecently releasedpollsshows that Trump’s handling of the scandal is approved byless than a majorityof Republicans.Even worse, nearly a majority of Republican respondents think a government cover-up is underway, according to a recently releasedEconomist/YouGov pollconducted July 25-28. In a newYahoo/YouGov polltaken from July 24-28, 55% of Republicans think the government is “hiding information about Epstein’s client list.”

Silver also argued “the evidence that the broader public is greatly concerned about the details of Epstein is pretty thin.” He pointed to Google search traffic on the issue, which he noted has been lower than searches on tariffs in April after Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement of a global trade war. But Epstein, unlike tariffs, is a known concept to most Americans. As even Silver admits, the Epstein saga has had “plenty of time for punditry and speculation.” That’s why aYahoo/YouGov pollfound the scandal had the fourth highest “heard a lot” score recorded since 2020.

Silver is correct to identify issues like immigration and the economy as the most important factors to the electorate writ large. To be sure, the news is bad on those fronts as well. A recent Galluppollfound twice as many Americans strongly disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration as approve of it. But what Silver’s analysis misses is that polling suggests Epstein is the issue most likely to finally fracture Trump’s support among his seemingly unmovable MAGA cohort. Only 44 percent of Republicans —roughly half the number who applaud his approach to immigration— approve of how Trump has dealt with the investigation so far.

It’s important to recall that Trump’s abysmal first-term poll numbers contributed to the Republican wipeout in the 2018 midterms, and likely to Trump’s 2020 defeat as well. Aside from the question of whether Epstein ultimately hurts Trump with voters who elected him in 2024, any comparison to the Russian interference investigation is doing the president’s work for him.

Trump has repeatedlypushedthe false narrative that Epstein-related stories are boosting his popularity. This comes as two of Epstein’s alleged victims and the family of another released two remarkable statements this week. First, the family of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s alleged victims who died by suicide in April, blasted the president for saying this week that Epstein “stole” the then-16-year-old from a job at Mar-a-Lago. On Friday they joined Annie and Maria Farmer tocriticize the White Housefor permitting the relocation of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to a federal prison camp after Justice Department lawyers met with her for two days last week and reportedly gained her cooperation in answering questions about the case. “President Trump has sent a clear message today,” the group said. “Pedophiles deserve preferential treatment and their victims do not matter.” Maxwell’s conviction as a sex offender would typically make her ineligible for the minimum-security camp.

Media coverage is always a judgment call — like Silver’s decision to use his column to promote the fact that Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction market where heworks as an advisor, allows people to bet on who might be linked to the child sex trafficking scandal. Silver laments that “on the left, there’s been a pervasive tendency — I call it ‘The Big Cope‘— to attribute whatever problems Democrats are having to media coverage,” as if making decisions about news content is a partisan problem that he’s immune to. Since gaining fame with a generational run that inarguably brought the field of polling analysis into the modern era, he has famously spent much of his time complaining about media coverage of  COVID-19 and former President Joe Biden’s gait.

With the presidentparading a registered sex offender, NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, around the White House this week, perhaps Nate Silver should stick to his first instinct that “maybe respectable college-educated, center-left types like me should have been paying more attention to Epstein all along.”

Condo owner Caroline Simmons toldWSB-TVthat nearly 50 units were impacted by abrupt water shut-offs ordered by the homeowners association and its utility contractor, Jasber Utility Services.

""We had people who are on dialysis and chemo who did not have water,"" Simmons said. ""We have children going to school without proper hygiene.""

A judge has since issued a temporary restraining order to force the water back on, but residents said it should never have reached that point.

According to Simmons, the conflict began when residents were told they would need to pay $1,600 out of pocket for new water meter installations — a cost many, especially those on fixed incomes, simply couldn't afford.

Despite lacking legal authority, Jasber allegedly proceeded to shut off water service anyway.

""They have a court order that lets them know they shouldn't be turning the water off, but they've been doing it anyway,"" Simmons said.

Unfortunately, this isn't an isolated case. Across the country, homeowners associations have faced criticism for controlling or outright neglecting access to essential utilities.

Whether it's preventing residents from installingsolar panels, banningnative plant lawns, or — like in this case — shutting off water altogether, these decisions often increase costs for homeowners, harm property value, and put people's safety at risk.

The environmental impact can be just as severe. Water shut-offs force families to rely on wastefulbottled water, which generates excessplastic pollution. A lack of water can also disrupt the balance of local ecosystems when lawns and landscapes are damaged.

Should the government be allowed to restrict how much water we use?

According to Atlanta News First, more than 180 overnight Delta flights were canceled as a result of what Delta described as severe summer weather. Delta was not the only airline impacted, but most of the canceled flights were Delta flights.

A Delta spokesperson described the move as “proactive” due to the severe summer weather.

“Yes, there are proactive cancellations today in Atlanta due to severe summer weather,” a spokesperson for Delta Air Lines told 11 Alive in Atlanta on Friday. “Safety for our passengers and crew is our top priority.”

The mass cancellations come after a ""nightmare"" Delta flight sent more than two dozen people to the hospital.

Delta Air Lines Flight 56 from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam experienced ""significant"" turbulence and needed to divert. When the plane landed, 25 people were hospitalized.

A woman who was aboard the flight said that the in-flight dinner service started when the shocking turbulence hit from out of nowhere.

""There was actually no warning. It was a very abrupt, hard hit,""said Leeann Nash, who spoke to Minneapolis' ABC affiliate.

""If you didn't have your seat belt on -- everyone that didn't -- they hit the ceiling, and then they fell to the ground, and the carts also hit the ceiling and fell to the ground, and people were injured, and it happened several times, so it was really scary.""

Needless to say, it seems like Delta was making safety a priority for its customers given the severe weather on Thursday night, especially after the scary incident that occurred earlier this week.

While the cancellations were undoubtedly frustrating, they were understandable in context.

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-rewriting-reality-jobs-numbers-040142480.html,2025-08-04 05:15:00,"Trump’s rewriting of reality on jobs numbers is chilling, but it could backfire","When authoritarianism encroaches, apologists often present a strongman’s power grabs as rational — even imperative for the national good.

Top Trump administration aides followed that playbook on Sunday, justifying the president’s abrupt firing of the government’s top labor official in charge of employment statistics over jobs numbers that dented his proclamation of a new “golden age.”

But theouster of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, taken alongside President Donald Trump’s concurrent bid to destroy the independence of the Federal Reserve, threatens the US economy’s reputation as a bulwark of stability and integrity that has undergirded generations of prosperity.

Such political interference might bolster Trump’s ever-growing power. But it could backfire by eroding the trust of investors, companies and organizations that depend on accurate and truthful statistics on the economy’s health to make major decisions that can impact the lives of millions of people. Even the Federal Reserve uses it to decide on monetary policy.

And when countries don’t firewall official data, they risk ending up like Argentina or Greece, where the invention of rosy statistics masked economic malaise and sparked financial crises. Or China, where fantastical official figures designed to bolster the regime’s credibility fostered corruption — and benefited the US by comparison.

Trump’s assault on the BLS is also more than a narrow economic question. It’s the latest erratic move by a president who believes he has total power and is immune from consequences, and who has become increasingly hubristic following a string of political wins this summer.

Trump’s domination of Congress and testing of constitutional limits have compromised constraints on presidential authority in a nation founded on the rejection of punitive and impetuous economic decisions by an all-powerful ruler.

His quest for omnipotence across society can also be seen in his successful attempts to impose his ideology on top universities, his coercion of big-time law firms and his attacks on the media. Mirroring his assault on economic data, Trump and his aides have launched a purge of government scientists and experts whose findings conflict with the MAGA movement’s doctrine on climate and vaccines. And while Republican presidents have sometimes had a point in arguing that their goals can be thwarted by a bureaucracy that they regard as overly liberal, Trump’s assault on the federal government that he leads has funneled ever more unaccountable power into the Oval Office.

But the president is taking a big economic risk.

In the short term, his attack on the credibility of government data may exacerbate the economic uncertainty already gathering around the White House and darkening GOP prospects in next year’s midterm elections.

“BLS is the finest statistical agency in the entire world. Its numbers are trusted all over the world,” former Commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics William Beach told Kasie Hunt on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I do believe, though, that the president’s attack on the commissioner and on the bureau is undermining that infrastructure, could undermine that trust over the long term.”

Senior Trump aides went onto Sunday shows to make a case for his volatile reaction to the jobs numbers that subverted his own version of reality.

“The president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers, they’re more transparent and more reliable,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House Economic Council,said Sundayon NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

On Monday, Hassett went even further, making a remarkable statement for someone in his position. Without offering any evidence, Hassett alleged in a CNBC interview that the jobs numbers could be “politically manipulated because they’re so untransparent.”

“There’s a black box system out there making the jobs numbers that needs to be improved,” Hassett continued.

Senate Democratic Minority leader Chuck Schumer responded to Hassett’s defense of Trump’s move by demanding his dismissal. “Kevin Hassett should be fired. He is defending Trump’s lies about the jobs report and the firing of Erika McEntarfer,” Schumerwrote on XMonday.

“The business community should demand a flack like him has no role at the Fed.”

Another top Trump official, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, argued on Sunday that “you want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers.” He said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “there are always revisions, but sometimes, you see these revisions go in really extreme ways. … The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”

Trump was irked by job data that showed the economy created only 73,000 jobs in July. The monthly totals for May and June were also revised downward by a combined 258,000 jobs. Such recalculations are integral to the bureau’s task of presenting an accurate picture of the economy over the longer term, and not just month to month. In this case, the jobs numbers appeared to confirm other indicators that contradict Trump’s claims the economy is roaring, amid data showing slowing growth and a rise in inflation last month.

One big danger now is that Trump’s economic fabulism will gather its own momentum and infect confidence in government statistics that will long outlive his presidency. Employment data is published as part of a multilayered process that would be almost impossible for one official to corrupt. But if Trump appoints a politicized official to head the BLS with an incentive to please him, the pressure on officials to produce corrupted data would be intense. If jobs numbers are worse next month, will he fire someone else? And if the numbers improve, will anyone believe in their integrity?

“Suppose that they get a new commissioner, and this person, male or female, are just the best people possible, right? And they do a bad number. Well, everybody’s going to think, ‘Well, it’s not as bad as it probably really is,’ because they’re going to suspect political influence,” Beach said on “State of the Union.”

The president’s turn against his own government’s nonpartisan number-crunchers when they produced a report that he didn’t like was rather predictable.

In 2018, he coaxed supporters from the real world into his illusory political environment,saying, “Just remember, what you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening.”

This mantra was borne out during his first term.

In his first hours in office, Trump furiously ignited a controversy over the size of the crowd at his inauguration, which he claimed, despite photographic evidence, was the biggest ever. At the time, this seemed an absurd sideshow. But it turned out to set the stage for an entire presidency of fabricating facts.

His attempt now to invent jobs numbers that fit with his version of reality recalls his negligent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump frequently claimedthat if the US stopped testing for the virus, it would simply have no more cases.

And Trump’s claim that Friday’s jobs numbers were “rigged” recalls his greatest-ever attack on truth: his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. When voters produced a result that he didn’t like, he attempted to destroy the credibility of the system that produced it and to fix the outcome.

Memories of 2020 are especially sobering in the light of Friday’s developments because of the way Trump’s personal embarrassments often lead him to pursue authoritarian outcomes.

Often, Trump’s critics have proclaimed that authoritarianism is on the march whatever he does. There’s an entire political and media industrial complex devoted to the idea that Americans are already living under a dictatorship.

There’s no comparison to the one-party police state endured by citizens of China. The dynastic tyranny of North Korea has no echoes in the United States, and this country is far short of the psychological torture suffered by the people of Myanmar, who live under a pervasive, repressive state. But Trump’s actions are adding to growing evidence that he is engineering a degradation of democratic and pluralistic institutions. Comparisons between the president and populist authoritarian strongmen leaders such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan look increasingly apt.

The new controversy over jobs numbers comes at a moment when the second Trump administration is acting almost without restraint.

Trump single-handedly remade the global trading system byimposing tariffs, apparently according to his whims, while completely bypassing a genuflecting GOP Congress that has done nothing to defend its constitutional authority to dictate policy in that area.

His transformation of the intelligence services into a vessel for his political convenience has led to false claims and probes accusing President Barack Obama’s administration of treason over Russian election meddling in 2016.

Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department is creating immense suspicion after Ghislaine Maxwell was moved to a more lenient prison after two days of talks with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Trump is struggling to end a political crisis over his ties to her late associate Jeffrey Epstein, an accused sex trafficker and convicted sex offender.

And on Sunday, Trump’s demands fora rewriting of congressional districts in Texasto make it easier for Republicans to cling onto the House next year precipitated a political crisis that is now having national implications.

Trump’s second term has often seemed like an attempt to recast the world as he’d prefer it to be. He’s pardoned or released criminals convicted in connection with the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. The Pentagon has removed photos of top brass who contradicted him from its walls. And Trump has repeatedly attacked judges and claimed their actions are illegal as part of a pattern of behavior that CNN’s Aaron Blake hasjustifiably called Orwellian.

An apparent sense that there’s no restraint on his power now seems to be feeding into Trump’s foreign policy.

Angered by Russia’s failure to sign up to his Ukraine peace plan, Trump last week reacted to threats by former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev by saying he’d repositioned US nuclear submarines.

Medvedev is now mostly known as an online troll and has only a minor position in Russian politics, so it’s hard to understand why Trump was so easily goaded. And Trump’s reaction ignored the fact that submarines that prowl the oceans in silence, carrying the second tier of the US nuclear deterrent, are constantly in position to fire off their missiles. But the spectacle of an American president indulging in nuclear saber-rattling, just before this week’s 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was chilling.

Meanwhile, Trump had a volcanic reaction following a rare show of dissent from Capitol Hill when Democrats, using their minority privileges in the Senate, blocked an attempt to ram through his conservative judicial nominees before the summer recess.Trump on Saturday told Schumerto “GO TO HELL!” after the collapse of a deal to swap some nominee confirmations for the restoration of some government funding cuts.

Such an extreme reaction to a rather routine example of congressional gridlock only underscores how Trump has become used to getting his way.

And he’s determined that no one will stop him.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -All three major U.S. stock indexes scored their biggest daily percentage increases since May 27 on Monday as investors sought bargains after the previous session's selloff and ramped up bets for a September interest rate cut after Friday's weaker-than-expected jobs data.

Tesla shares rose 2.2% after the electric vehicle maker granted CEO Elon Musk 96 million shares worth about $29 billion.

Friday's selloff followed bleak July jobs data that was accompanied by steep downward revisions for May and June.

""Today is just a little bit of dip-buying. It does show a pretty healthy sign of folks out there looking for an opportunity to get in,"" said Mike Dickson, head of research and quantitative strategies at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina.

""It's a little concerning in the sense the labor market ... definitely appears to be weaker than people expected. A bit of an offset to that is the renewed rate cut expectations. There's a high probability we're getting a September cut.""

Odds for a September rate cut now stand at about 84%, according to CME Fedwatch. Market participants see at least two quarter-point cuts by the end of this year.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq had hit a string of record highs recently.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 585.06 points, or 1.34%, to 44,173.64, the S&P 500 gained 91.93 points, or 1.47%, at 6,329.94 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 403.45 points, or 1.95%, to 21,053.58.

Investors were still digesting U.S. President Donald Trump's firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday as he accused her of faking the weak jobs numbers.

Also on Friday, Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned, which could open the door for changes from Trump. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut rates.

On the trade front, Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on goods from India over its Russian oil purchases, while New Delhi said it would take measures to safeguard its interests and called its targeting by the U.S. president ""unjustified.""

Second-quarter U.S. earnings season is winding down, but investors still look forward to reports this week from companies like Walt Disney.

Among rising shares on Monday, Spotify gained 5% as the music streaming platform announced plans to raise the monthly price of its premium individual subscription in select markets from September.

Joby Aviation jumped 18.8% after the company said it will acquire helicopter ride-share company Blade Air Mobility's passenger business for up to $125 million. Blade Air shares rose 17.2%.

Among the day's decliners, Class A shares of Warren Buffett's BerkshireHathaway fell 2.7% as investors took in a $3.8 billion write-down and a dip in quarterly operating profit that the firm disclosed on Saturday.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.48-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. There were 136 new highs and 51 new lows on the NYSE.

On the Nasdaq, 3,487 stocks rose and 1,090 fell as advancers outnumbered decliners by a 3.2-to-1 ratio.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 15.05 billion shares, compared with the 18.37 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

In a post sharedto Instagramon Aug. 1, the longtime TV chef and cookbook author announced the sudden closure of two Savannah staples: The Lady & Sons and the adjoining takeout spot, The Chicken Box.

“Hey, y’all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,” Deen, 78, captioned a photo of the restaurant building that said “Blessed to Serve 1989- 2025.”

Deen thanked her customers and staff at the family-style dining eatery, noting that she would always consider Savannah to be her home. “Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,” she added.

“We will now focus our attention on the four Paula Deen’s Family Kitchen locations across the country—in Pigeon Forge, Myrtle Beach, Nashville, and Branson,” she added. “We’re excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly, starting with Branson on August 8th.”

Patrons were reportedly blindsided by the sudden announcement, with reservations for Aug. 1 canceled hours before the announcement went out,the Associated Press reported. The outlet noted that Deen’s restaurant was always “packed” before the abrupt shutdown.

Deen started her business as a lunch bag business, The Bag Lady, which she ran out of her home in the 1980s. The divorced mom of two made pimento cheese sandwiches, soups, and salads and sent her sons, Jaime and Bobby, to peddle them at local businesses.

The popularity of her comfort food eventually spawned The Lady & Sons restaurant, which she ran with her sons. The menu, and the adjoining Chicken Box takeout store, featured Southern recipes later featured on her Food Network Show, “Paula’s Home Cooking,” including fried chicken, sweet potatoes, cheese biscuits, and decadent banana pudding.

“I think the feeling is people are looking for that comfort, that feeling of being safe and having the food they grew up with,” Deen toldtheLos Angeles Timesin 2002. “Not fancy food, but food that makes you feel good.”

The success of Deen’s restaurant earned her several Food Network series, starting withPaula’s Home Cookingin 2002. She also hostedPaula’s PartyandPaula’s Best Disheson Food Network before the network ended her contract amid a racial slur scandal.

Deen went on to host the syndicatedPositively PaulaandPaula Deen’s Sweet Home Savannah. She also published 15 cookbooks and launched a lifestyle magazine,Cooking With Paula Deen.She most recently was a guest star on Gordon Ramsay’sMasterChef: Legendson Fox.

Less than two months before announcing the shutdown of the restaurant that started it all, Deen posted a nostalgic throwbackto Instagramas she looked back at her Bag Lady business from three decades ago.

“36 years, I embarked on a journey that would change my life—I started The Bag Lady with my last $200,"" she wrote. ""Isn't it incredible how far we can go when our backs are against the wall?”

Books,removedfrom military academies. Names of civil rights leaders,erasedfrom ships. History lessons, purged from museums.

The list goes on and on. President Trump and his government appointees keep asserting more control over ideas and information — which has the effect of taking power away from independent researchers, historians, and the real news outlets that he frequently calls “fake.”

Friday’s abruptfiring of the labor statistics chiefis one of the most dramatic examples yet.

But this push for control has been evident all throughout his second term — and the individual headlines should be analyzed as part of a pattern, lest the memories start to fade.

Remember the headlines aboutvaccine data being deletedfrom government websites last winter? Orthe bogus mathon DOGE’s “receipts” page? How about the “Friday night purge” of impartial watchdogs investigating abuse within the government?

“Trump increasingly is playing the role of information gatekeeper,” Clay Calvert of the American Enterprise Institute wrote a prophetic blog post back in February.

Calvert said Trump was “dictating access on his terms” – promoting MAGA media outlets while punishing The Associated Press for not adopting Trump’s “Gulf of America” name.

That AP dispute was about control over information. So, too, was the Trump White House’s decision topurge a database of transcriptsdocumenting his announcements and public appearances.

The president has also objected to unflattering stories bylodging legal threatsagainst news outlets. In one recent case, he followed through with a defamationlawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, which analysts said could have a chilling effect on reporting writ large.

The White House has framed some of its most aggressive rewrites and removals as common-sense corrections. “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” was the title of one such executive order in March.

Another move to shut down a reliable source of information, the US-funded international broadcaster known as Voice of America, was framed by the administration as a way to curtail “radical propaganda.” One of the alleged examples was a six-year-old news report “about transgender migrants seeking asylum in the United States.”

Every administration tries to shape reality to some degree. But “Trump’s statistical purges have been faster and more sweeping — picking off not just select factoids but entire troves of public information,” the Washington Postassertedin March.

One glaring example involves the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report on climate change. The authors of the assessment were fired and previous versions “have been hidden from view on government websites,” as CNN’s Zachary B. Wolfwrote last week.

Trump’s dispute with the Bureau of Labor Statistics further raises the stakes — and the alarms about creeping authoritarianism.

“Suppressing statisticians is a time-honored tool for leaders trying to solidify their power and stifle dissent,” George Stephanopoulos said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “It’s happened throughout history, most recently in Venezuela and Turkey.”

His guest, Lawrence Summers, the former treasury secretary, said that “firing statisticians goes with threatening the heads of newspapers. It goes with launching assaults on universities. It goes with launching assaults on law firms.”

“This is really scary stuff,” Summers added.

Yet some Trump aides and allies are publicly defending the firing. National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Monday morning on CNBC that the jobs data “could be politically manipulated.”

This battle for control isn’t happening in a vacuum. There is evidence that media scrutiny and public pressure do make a difference.

Back in March, the Associated Press revealed that an anti-DEI crusade at the Pentagon led to images of war heroes, women, minorities and even the famed Enola Gay warplane being flagged for removal. The embarrassing episode forced Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s aides into a defensive crouch.

Similarly, just last week, the Washington Post reported on the Smithsonian removing Trump’s name from an impeachment exhibit at the National Museum of American History.

The whiff of scandal was so overwhelming that the museum issued a statement on Saturday denying any White House pressure and pledging to update the exhibit in the coming weeks.

The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.

As Pennsylvania and other states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.

“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.

“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.

We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.

– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce

“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”

But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.

“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.

State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.

But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.

Trump has falselyclaimedthat wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”

While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.

“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.

“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.

“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”

Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.

“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

Trump aims to shut down state climate policies

According to areportfrom Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.

Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.

Analysts havenotedthat the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.

“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”

Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.

“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

(FOX 56) — Tensions were high on Monday evening in London as the city council proposed a bombshell resolution in a public meeting. Some members tried to impeach the mayor.

This comes on the heels of several recent lawsuits and allegations made against Mayor Randall Weddle.

It was a packed and vocal crowd at the London Community Center as the city council presented more than a dozen charges against Weddle, including violating proper procedure in dismissing members of the London Housing Authority and claims he harassed city employees.

The resolution seeks to remove the mayor from office, but it came as a shock to many.

“I had no idea this was going to be brought up tonight,” said City Attorney Larry Bryson.

Community members who support the mayor said there is insufficient evidence to support the council’s claims.

“I’ve not seen anything that supports what is in this resolution that they put in the amended agenda,” said Katie Johnson, who works in London. “There’s nothing that backs it up. Nothing that I have seen that truly backs that up other than hearsay.”

Weddle said the council should be obligated to conduct a proper investigation before taking any further action.

“They’ve stated these charges without one exploratory committee, one investigation not one time come into the city hall to look into documentation without going to the Housing Authority to look at documentation,” said Weddle. “You’ve read social media, and now you want to charge me with a bunch of lies.”

Attorney Brandon Voelker is representing several people behind some of the claims. He said former London police officer Jared Hale was forced out of his job following alleged harassment and defamation at the hands of Weddle.

Voelker claims this happened after Weddle released a dispatch call between Hale and the judge executive on the internet following the death of Doug Harless.

“It would appear that what they were trying to do was somehow deflect from the fact that what’s been heavily reported, and I think even confirmed, is that people were going to the wrong house and shot an innocent man,” said Voelker.

Although there was heated discussion between the council and mayor and an abrupt end to the meeting, an attorney representing the council told FOX 56 the resolution to impeach the mayor will move forward to the next phase.

“There was no citation of any laws that were violated in this motion,” said TJ Roberts, who was representing Chris Wiest Attorney at Law PLLC. “So as a result, I would say that this motion was validly adopted.”

A hearing will now be scheduled for that vote to impeach, but attorneys said it would take a unanimous vote to remove Weddle from office.

The closure of Broadacres Marketplace in June was so abrupt Guadalupe Media didn’t have time to repair an electrical outage at her booth before she was told to pack up and leave for an undetermined amount of time.

When the market finally reopened Friday after a six-week closure, Media raced to borrow an extension cord and hook up to a neighboring vendor’s power outlet before sunset. After more than a month of lost income, she couldn’t afford to lose another day.

“I’m not someone who gives up,” Media said in her native Spanish.

The sprawling open-air market in North Las Vegas officially reopened to the public Friday evening afterabruptly shutting downon June 21 — a week after Border Patrol agents carried out a raid at a swap meet in Southern California run by the same company that owns Broadacres Marketplace, Newport Diversified Inc.

Videos of the immigration sweep at the California swap meet were quickly posted on social media where vendors, customers and staff in Las Vegas watched with mounting concern.

Some vendors stopped showing up amid fears that Broadacres could be next. Vendors who did continue operations said foot traffic and sales cratered as customers stayed home. The weekend before the market’s closure, Media said she only made $37 in sales — a fraction of what she typically makes selling jewelry and accessories.

“A lot of people stopped coming. Sales dropped really bad. Everyone was scared, they’re still scared,” Media said.

Those same concerns led the owners of Broadacres Marketplace to temporarily shut down “out of an abundance of caution” for its vendors, customers, and staff — many of whom are immigrants or second-generation U.S. citizens with family members who are immigrants.

“We don’t want any of our customers, vendors, or employees to be detained at our business,” the Broadacres Marketplace management team wrote onsocial mediaat the time.

Despite claims by the Trump administration that its primary concern is detaining and deporting violent criminals, about 40% of people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the last six monthsdid not have criminal charges or convictions, according to data compiled by UC Berkeley School of Law’sDeportation Data Project.

Broadacres Marketplace is the largest open-air market in Nevada and one of the top private employers in North Las Vegas, but empty stalls on Friday underscored how immigrant-owned businesses have suffered sharp losses under the immigration crackdown.

Returning vendors were met with digital signs on Friday displaying information from legal aid groups, a clear indication of how much things have changed.

During the market’s closure, management said they partnered with legal experts and community advocates to develop a “vendor alert protocol” that will provide real-time updates on law enforcement activity in the area “within legal guidelines.”

“We’re reopening because our vendors are ready — and they deserve a marketplace that has their back,” said management in a statementon their website.

Educational materials will be available throughout the market to help vendors and customers better understand their legal rights, said management.

Vendors and customers who want more direction on how to handle encounters with law enforcement at the market can also take “Know Your Rights” training offered by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada in partnership with Broadacres Marketplace.

Agustin Ramirez has been selling fruits and vegetables at his Broadacres stand since 1994 — his most popular item are coconuts which are husked and served with lime and chili. But even sales for his signature product are slow with more customers staying away this summer.

As his sole source of income, the loss of customers at the stand is a big concern for Ramirez, but he’s optimistic he and his employees can weather the storm until the community feels safe enough to return.

One sign of recovery was the steady stream of customers filing into the market as soon as it opened Friday evening, who were either pulled in by their loyalty to vendors they’ve frequented for years or by a  discounted $2 entry fee.(Tickets are normally $3 on Fridays, $2.50 on Saturdays and $3.50 on Sundays.)

“With fear or without fear we have to keep living, we can’t shut ourselves inside for the rest of our lives,” Ramirez said in his native Spanish.

During the six week closure, Ramirez said he worked on preparing his undocumented employees with an exit plan in the event Broadacres is targeted by immigration officers.

“We already have plans,” Ramirez said. “Whatever happens, they know where to go, where to run.”

Beyond the market’s role as an economic hub for immigrants, it has also created a sense of community for vendors and customers through the decades.

Before Media and her husband started their business at Broadacres four years ago they were customers for more than a decade.She remembers walking through the lines of vendors with her children, who now help run the business as adults.

Generations of families have memories of letting their children ride a pony at one of the oldest businesses in Broadacres Marketplace, a round plot of ground surrounded by asphalt — and more often than not — eager children.

Francisco Andredes, who grew up in rural Mexico, bought the business from the previous owner 14 years ago after his own children became frequent customers. It’s another example of how embedded the market has become in the Las Vegas immigrant community.

When Maribel Sanchez started her clothing business at Broadacres 25 years ago the market was much smaller than it is now. Its growth over the years shows the strength of the immigrant community, she said.

The market must now recover under difficult circumstances, as the ongoing immigration raids at job sites that drove Broadacres managers to shut down in June show no sign of abating.

Broadacres heavily publicized the market’s reopening and its new protocols meant to reassure vendors and customers, which Sanchez hopes will help increase business. Under a best case scenario, the market’s closure and then reopening will attract customers whos haven’t been in years, or new customers finding out about  the market for the first time.

“It’s like being in Mexico, it’s a beautiful place. I hope people will come,” Sanchez said."

Washington Bridge lawsuit has another day in court,"Warren Hutchison, an attorney with Freeman Mathis and Gary representing Steere Engineering, warns of the consequences if the state can claim negligence against Washington Bridge contractors without proving specific physical damages in Providence Superior Court on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2025. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)

A Tuesday morning hearing in thestate’s lawsuitagainst Washington Bridge contractors offered a crash course in legal theory, but little direction on whether the companies that worked on the bridge before its closure will have to pay.

Phrases like “economic loss doctrine” and “integrated system theory” peppered the 90-minute hearing in Rhode Island Superior Court Judge Brian Stern’s third-floor Providence courtroom. The state, represented by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General and private attorneys, contends that the 13 companies brought on toinspect, repair and maintain the westbound highway span since 2013 should be held responsible for failing to detect structural deficiencies that led to its abrupt closure in December 2023.

Lawyers for four engineering and construction vendors argue they had no contractual obligation to prevent or detect the infrastructure problems. They are asking to throw out all or parts of the state’s claims against them.

Stern did not rule on the motion Tuesday, but said he plans to make a decision by the end of the month.

A similar back-and-forth over the legal standard for the lawsuit played outearlier this year,when seven of the 13 vendors pushed to have the case tossed. Their arguments centered on a legal principle oft-invoked in construction cases known as the economic loss doctrine, which shields contractors from being sued for unspecified and foreseeable economic harms, including product damage and profit losses.

Personal injury and damage to property beyond the product itself are the most common criteria used in successful negligence cases against construction contractors.

Stern’sFeb. 27 orderrejected the first attempt by seven of the 13 contractors to toss the case, concluding there was not enough evidence to meet the high legal standard of proof to warrant such a definitive move. But he noted flaws in the state’s initial,August 2024 complaint, which failed to identify specific physical damages beyond the bridge itself.

The state’s amended complaint, filed in April, narrows the focus to wear and tear on the separate, eastbound bridge, which was reconfigured to accommodate Interstate 195 traffic in both directions. It again seeks damages for negligence and breach of contract by the same 13 vendors.

The53-pageupdated complaint stands in direct contradiction to Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter J. Alviti’s repeated public assurances that the eastbound bridge was in “good condition” despite the increased traffic load.

Alviti’s public statements didn’t surface in court Tuesday.

Instead, attorneys for the four vendors still seeking to throw out the complaint — Steere Engineering, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc.,Aries Support Services, Inc.,and Commonwealth Engineers & Consultants, Inc. — referred back to the economic loss doctrine as the foundation for their arguments.

“We still have the same fundamental deficiency,” said Michael Creta,a partner at K&L Gates in Boston representing Jacobs Engineering. “The state failed to prove other property damage to get around the economic loss doctrine.”

Creta said later, “There is nothing in the amended complaintabout damage besides wear and tear, full stop.”

Warren Hutchison, an attorney with Freeman Mathis and Gary representing Steere Engineering, warned of the consequences for future contract disputes if the state can claim negligence against its contractors without proving specific physical damages.

“If we oppose the economic loss doctrine in this case, will the plaintiff ever have a remedy?” Hutchison asked.

Stephen Provazza, assistant state attorney general, countered that the weight and volume of traffic now concentrated along the eastbound bridge — necessitating more frequent repairs and intensive monitoring — met the legal standard to justify negligence.

“The natural consequence of negligence isn’t automatically the bridge being closed,” Provazza said. “This was a sudden disaster, not something you expect when you’re sitting down to negotiate a contract.”

Attorneys for other companies named in the lawsuit attended the hearing, though they have not argued for the case to be thrown out. Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican and an attorney who represents Vanasse Hanglin Brustlin in the lawsuit, said in an interview after the hearing that if Stern sided with the contractors, he would piggyback on their motion on behalf of his client.

Stern offered little indication of how he will decide, interjecting periodically to ask for clarification from the attorneys who spoke. If he rejects the contractors’ arguments for a second time, the lawsuit will proceed down the long and winding road to trial, with atentative scheduleproposing a six-to-eight-week trial starting in November 2027 — one year before the expectedcompletion dateof the new, westbound Washington Bridge.

“One thing the court is wrestling with: At what point should the court deal with this, versus letting it develop a record and maybe it will deal with itself,” Stern said.

The Rhode Island Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Tuesday.

Yeonsoo Go, 20, was taken into custody on Thursday during a routineimmigrationhearing in Manhattan, according to her attorneys and family. She was then transferred to a federal detention facility in Monroe, Louisiana, where she was held for three nights before being released without bail on Monday.

Mary Rothwell Davis, an attorney for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, where Go’s mother works as a priest, said the family had not received an explanation for the arrest or abrupt reversal.

“We don’t know why it happened, but we’re very happy that it did,” Davis said. “We were moving heaven and earth to make it known that we thought this was a mistake.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Go had been placed in expedited removal proceedings for overstaying an expired visa. The agency did not respond to questions about what prompted Go's release.

“The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice — they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported,"" agency spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

But Davis disputed the contention that Go was here illegally. She said Go has maintained a valid visa since arriving in the U.S. in 2021, along with her mother, Rev. Kyrie Kim, who leads a Korean congregation in the New York area.

A graduate of Scarsdale High School in the suburbs of New York City, Go studies at Purdue's College of Pharmacy and remains active in the Episcopalian church, according to Davis.

In recent days, clergy members, including Bishop Matthew Heyd, as well as the church leaders in Korea, have called on theTrumpadministration to release Go, insisting that her arrest was a mistake.

“Whether it was our outcry or some other factor that persuaded DHS to send her home, we don’t know, but we’re so grateful,” Davis said, adding that Go’s experience in detention was “unbelievably traumatic.”

New York State Assemblymember Amy Paulin, a Democrat, said she had spoken by phone with Go, who she described as “relieved” to be home.

“She is home, she is safe, and she is so grateful for the outpouring of love and support from this incredible community,” Paulin said."

The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.

As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.

“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”

Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.

“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.

We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it.

– Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce

“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”

But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.

“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.

State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.

But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.

Trump has falselyclaimedthat wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”

While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.

“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.

“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.

“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”

Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.

“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to areportfrom Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.

Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.

Analysts havenotedthat the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.

“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”

Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.

“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

The National Weather Service has received permission to hire hundreds of employees,CNNreported Tuesday. That includes 450 meteorologists, hydrologists, and radar technicians to replace the ones that were let go from the agency at the behest of former DOGE chief Elon Musk.

The order also includes 126 openings for “front-line mission critical” personnel that had been previously approved, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official who spoke with CNN.

The agency’s recent shortcomings have come under scrutiny in the aftermath of the Texas floods, which killed at least 120 people, including 35 children.*

Cuts to the department had severed contracts for more than 550 people, dropping the weather service’s staffing levels to below 4,000 total employees and sparking fears that the country could find itself terribly ill prepared amid peak hurricane season. It’s possible that some of the new hires could be former employees brought back to the agency.

NWS employees have been cautiously receptive to the news, which was first announced at an all-hands meeting on Monday, according to CNN. Exhausted staffers who had been tasked with working additional hours with added responsibilities due to the abrupt layoffs are reportedly irate at the realization that their peers’ job loss was pointless.

“How much time/money is it going to cost to train a bunch of new people when we had already-trained people in place?” an unidentified NOAA official told CNN.

It’s not the only recent rescission of Musk’s efforts atop the federal government. The Office of Personnel Managementreleased a memoto employees Tuesday announcing the end of Musk’s extremely controversial email initiative requiring federal employees to document their weekly accomplishments to the department.

Musk and Trump were practically inseparable until the pairfell outover Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which included funds to undo some of DOGE’s work. The world’s richest man—and Trump’s biggest financier—accused the tax plan of being “pork-filled” while promising to torpedo Republicans’ midterm success by funding their opponents’ campaigns. (He failed to sway any Republican votes.)

In the aftermath of the bill, Trump and the tech billionaire unloaded on one another on each of their respective social media platforms, accusing each other of being unlikable, untrustworthy, and evenunreal.

The investigation into Kim Keon Hee is one ofthree separate special prosecutor probeslaunched under Seoul’s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, who wasremoved from office in Aprilandrearrested last monthover his brief imposition of martial law in December.

The conservative's abrupt and poorly plannedpower grab on Dec. 3came during a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, whom he described as “anti-state” forces abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon's actions were at least partly motivated bygrowing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.

“I apologize for causing concern to the people, even though I am someone insignificant,” Kim told reporters as she arrived for questioning. She added that she would sincerely cooperate with the investigation, before walking away without responding to specific questions about the allegations.

The team of investigators led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki said Kim was questioned for about seven hours until Wednesday afternoon, but they didn’t specify whether she will be summoned again. Investigators said they haven't decided whether they would seek her arrest.

Through a heavy police presence, dozens of Yoon’s supporters gathered outside the special prosecutor’s office in downtown Seoul, waving South Korean and U.S. flags and banners in light rain.

Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month and faces a high-stakes trial onrebellionandother charges, resisted an attempt by investigators last week to compel him for questioning over his wife. Investigators saidhe took off his prison uniformand laid down on the floor of his cell in his underwear before they gave up executing the warrant to detain him. They plan to negotiate with Yoon’s lawyers to arrange a possible questioning.

Yoon and Kim have faced suspicions of exerting undue influence over the conservative People Power Party to nominate a specific candidate for a 2022 parliamentary by-election, allegedly at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoonbefore he became president.

Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. While in office,Yoon repeatedly dismissed calls to investigate his wife, denouncing them as baseless political attacks.

Yoon’smartial law decree lasted only hours,after a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through a blockade of heavily armed soldiers and voted to revoke the measure. He was impeached by lawmakers on Dec. 14 and was formally removed from office by the Constitutional Court in April.

Shortly after winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal PresidentLee Jae Myungapproved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon’s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident Lee’s Democratic Party claims Yoon’s government tried to cover up.

Yoon had been released from prison in March after the Seoul Central District Court overturned his January arrest, but the same court approved his new arrest in July, accepting a special prosecutor’s claim that he poses a risk of destroying evidence."

In contemporary Chile, this ecological upheaval is on stark display in La Araucanía, the homeland of the Mapuche. There, plantations of Monterey pine and eucalyptus span hundreds of thousands of acres—adding up to an areamore than doublethe size of the region’s remaining natural forest—and much of the rest of the land is overtaken by the cultivation of European crops like wheat, oats, lupines, fruits, and berries.

Imperialism, both military and ecological, took place later in La Araucanía than in many other parts of the colonial world. Finding themselves unable to conquer the area, Spanish settlers held a series of congresses delineating a border between their colony of Chile and Mapuche territory. “The uniqueness of this situation must be stressed,”writessociologist Patricia Richards. “Unlike the indigenous in other parts of the Americas, the Mapuche … were people whose rights to independence, sovereign territory, and (albeit precarious) peace were officially recognized by the Spanish.”

In the late 1800s, however, bolstered by new military technology, the now-independent state of Chile undertook a violent, multi-decadecampaignthat it referred to as the “pacification” of La Araucanía. By 1883, the military had seized all but 500,000 of the community’s 10 million hectares, assigning Mapuche families to small parcels called “reductions” and auctioning the rest of the lands to settlers. That process of allotment began the region’s transformation into “the granary of Chile.” Then, in the 1970s, during the nation’s military dictatorship, new tax incentives lured timber companies to establish plantations in the country. Forestry exports increased a thousandfold over the next 40 years, at the same time that Mapuche who had relied on native forests for subsistence needs like firewood, foraging, and hunting small animals found themselvessuddenly barredfrom those areas. In 1978, the government converted the Mapuche’s collective land titles into individual deeds, allowing their territory to be sold in parcels and fragmented. The combination of these policies pushed thousands of Mapuche out of the region.

Today, 80 percent of Chile’s Mapuche reside in urban areas, many of them in the apartment blocks and terraced housing on the periphery of Santiago. This is the terrain of Daniela Catrileo’s novelChilco—first published in Spanish in 2023, and now available in an impressive English translation by Jacob Edelstein. It travels from the “vertical ghettos” and “wandering neighborhoods” of the capital to the fictional island of Chilco and wonders what it would mean, really, for contemporary Indigenous Chileans to return home.

Catrileo is a leader of a new generation of Chilean writers who depict and theorize Mapuche life from the perspective of the urban diaspora. Her grandfather and father came to Santiago from La Araucanía in the 1970s; like others, they faced discrimination and stopped speaking Mapudungun, the Mapuche language. Catrileo was born in 1987 and grew up in a social-housing apartment on the southern periphery of Santiago. (Her mother is not Mapuche.) Instead of “Santiaguinos,” then, Catrileo and many of her peers and characters arewarriaches—urban Mapuches. The term, a portmanteau of the Mapudungun wordswarria(city) andche(person), became commonly used in the 1990s.

For those who identify with it, the word offers a means to insist on Mapuche identity and resist assimilation. With the rural-to-urban migration that followed the reforms of the 1970s, the displaced Mapuche came to be seen as simply part of the city’s poor. This served the state’s narrative about Chile as a multicultural polity whose denizens enjoyed undifferentiated access to rights and privileges. The idea of araza chilenainitially coalesced in the early twentieth century as a notion of race that, in Richards’s words, “built on but elided” Indigeneity. This conception of the Chilean race distanced itself from “pure” whiteness, but it also distanced itself frommestizaje, or racial mixing between European-descended settlers and Indigenous Chileans. Someone like Catrileo ischampurría,a word that evokes the action of swirling a mixed drink; one columnistdecries itas being “neither ‘purely’ Mapuche nor ‘purely’ Chilean.” To identify aswarriacheandchampurría, then, is to become interlocked with Mapuche land struggles, to assert an existence that the state would prefer to overlook, and to align oneself with the Indigenous side of a history of dispossession that remains contested.

“I have a wounded river / in the form of a canal / that shouts ‘Indian’ and throws me to the street.”

Catrileo’s work operates from within these open questions of Indigenous identity, severed connections to landscape, and the rural-urban divide from an intimate and feminist perspective. Her first book, in 2013, was a collection of poemstitledRío herido,or “wounded river”—at once a translation of her Mapuche surname and a reference to the impoverished neighborhoods along two Santiago waterways where many Mapuche migrants settled. The poems capture an ambivalence to the experience of the urban Mapuche: “I have a wounded river / in the form of a canal / that shouts ‘Indian’ and throws me to the street,” reads one fragment; another proclaims, “The elements / dragged by the river / in its wounded journey / create deep fertile plains.”

The stories in 2019’sPiñen, Catrileo’s first book of prose, take place in the same landscape of the Santiago periphery (FSG Originals will publish Edelstein’s translation ofPiñennext spring). “Everyone who came ended up living in the shantytowns along the Zanjón de la Aguada, near the Franklin barrio,” Catrileo narrates in the story “Have You Seen How the Weeds Sprout From the Dry Ground?” (the title is a playful echo of a line by Mexican poet Jaime Sabines). Both books insist on the city as an Indigenous space at the same time as they emphasize the marginality ofwarriachesrelative both to other urban Chileans and to their own Indigenous communities.

Catrileo’s poetry chapbooksEl territorio del viaje(The Territory of the Journey,2017) andLas aguas dejaron de unirse a otras aguas(The Waters Stopped Joining Other Waters, 2020) each relate a journey to La Araucanía. In both, return is ambivalent and incomplete. While it pleases the narrator to be in a place where “we are the majority,” her arrival is complicated by the reality on the ground: The region has been militarized by the Chilean state due to Mapuche land struggles, and her own feeling of belonging in the rural landscape is at once deep and partial. “A woman appears / I ask her for a beer. / ‘You’re not from here,’ she says. / How are you supposed to respond to that?”

Chilco,perhaps, is the response—a synthesis of the themes of home, identity, and displacement present in Catrileo’s previous works. The novel takes place in afictionalizedChile marked by the same wounds of colonialism, dictatorship, and neoliberal economic doctrine as that of the real world. It follows two characters, Marina Quispe Quispe, or Mari, and her partner, Pascale Antilaf, as they migrate from Capital City to Chilco, where Pascale grew up. The book is poetic and documentary, with a plot that develops through imagistic prose and a form structured around a “Chilco Archive,” which introduces readers to the history, geography, early chroniclers, and illustrations of the invented island.

Mari,Chilco’s narrator, grew up with her mother and grandmother, an immigrant from Peru, in the periphery of Capital City, living in “identical towers [of] slender little apartments stacked thirty floors high” and operating a Peruvian food market. The neighborhood, she tells us, is called “La Chimba”; this means “from the other side” in the Indigenous Quechua language, and an area of the northern reaches of Santiago did historically bear that name.

Shortly after Mari has begun to explore an identity as not only Peruvian, but Quechua and therefore Indigenous, she meets Pascale, who has been hired to do construction work at the museum where she works as a secretary. Pascale is mixed-race, born to a Mapuche father from Chilco and a mainlander mother. Chilco, the book’s opening pages tell us, both means “watery” in Mapudungun and refers to theplantFuchsia magellanica,or fuchsia, which grows on the island.

The couple live together in an upper-floor apartment in a dilapidated building in the city’s neoclassical historic center. Though they have little money, they feel solidarity with others living the same precarious existence: “We were assembling communities with the common goal of resisting real estate speculation and voracious gentrification.” Mari refers to this period as “the gentle times.”

They are queer: Mari recalls her family discovering her attraction to women, and while the novel manages to avoid using any pronoun for Pascale, it makes references to experiences of anti-queer violence and the relief of being able to “walk freely through the streets” in the city. But equally important as a genderqueer identity to Pascale is the identity of being from Chilco: “I can’t help but be shocked by the unruly landscape Pascale carries within,” Mari narrates. Elsewhere, she remarks that, though many people fled Chilco, “as they did, melancholy killed them. They never found their place.”

The gentle times come to an end when a set of housing towers collapses suddenly. In response, residents of the city descend on the site to finish the job—what Mari calls “the devastation of the devastation.” She narrates the destruction in a series of lines that float between poetry and prose:

Those days made a din like the rumble of industry. Through the joyful shouting, something like the noise of a construction site emerged, except our aim was quite the opposite.

The neighborhood smelled of sweat, of wet earth, of firewood.

We were all covered in dirt, in sawdust.

Faces stained with ash but smiling.

The residents, it seems, see the demolition as a riot against inequality. Instead of bringing justice, though, things get worse. The city begins to fill with mysterious sinkholes at the same time as the property management and utility companies abandon the capital in favor of constructing a model city in the hills above the capital called EcoMahuida—appropriating the Mapudungun word for “mountain and forest.” “Everything carried on as before, but with an even deeper inequality,” says Mari. “The fractures and holes in the earth also pierced our flesh.”

As the situation worsens, Pascale longs for Chilco. Finally, the pair decide to move to the island together. Though “there were no real jobs, and there was a lack of food and basic supplies,” the distance from the capital is a relief. “It was our most beautiful summer, far from the sinkholes, the deaths, and the soldiers,” Mari says.

Still, she feels caught between the beauty of getting to know a new place—“Each new thing I learn is a forest that grows”—and her exclusion from the community of islanders, as a mainlander. Even over dinner with Pascale’s family, “they barely look me in the eye, as if my being there were an accident.” She is also haunted by a smell of putrefaction that no one else seems to notice. Something, it seems, is not quite right—the return to the homeland is not as idyllic as planned.

In the final chapter, in the course of an eight-page section titled “Afternoon,” Mari goes out on a walk to sketch plants and gets caught in a storm. She takes shelter in a house where only a teenager is present. As the teenager attempts to situate Mari, he refers to Pascale as “that weird girl.” Mari becomes uncomfortable and leaves. On her way home, she hears a gunshot—and from there the novel jumps quickly to a violent conclusion.

Without spoiling the ending, I think it’s important to note the abrupt movement of the novel’s close. On first read, it feels like a weak attempt at denouement after so much slow, sensory observation. Even the mysterious rankness that pursues Mari seemed to foreshadow something much subtler. Yet in the dissonance between the characters’ story of love and perseverance and the sudden annihilation of their future, the novel’s purpose is recast. Instead of a story of “making do” even under the most adverse of circumstances,Chilcobecomes a novel about the impossibility of return on an existential level.

I came to terms withChilco’s ending by thinking about it in light of the work of another queer and Indigenous writer, one from the boreal extreme of the Western Hemisphere: Cree poet and novelist Billy-Ray Belcourt. One of the central debates in queer theory is the question of how to relate to the future. Literary critic Lee Edelman argued controversially in 2004’sNo Futurethat queer people should embrace the figure of the “Scrooge,” turning their backs on society’s orientation toward children, reproduction, and the very notion of “the future.” Five years later, cultural studies theorist José Esteban Muñozwrote, in response, that queerness itself was a future-oriented concept—a utopian future now visible only in glimpses on the horizon.

Belcourt’s work intervenes to add that, for Indigenous queers, the debate is all but moot: The future was taken away long ago. And yet there is nowhere else to go besides the grief-filled present. Hewrites: “Maybe / reserve is / another word / for morgue / is another word / for body bags /—call it home anyways.” For Mari and Pascale, home is also a place where death is close at hand.

On the penultimate page ofChilco,“on the horizon of the sea, the impossible appears.” When all hope has been lost, the villagers of Chilco gather in ceremony on the beach to honor three massive whales that have come into view. “They’re immense, swimming in circles, unafraid of extinction,” remarks Mari. Mulling the creatures’ miracle of defying death seems to revive her faith that there is hope for humans, too.

If the imposition of new ecologies was integral to the European colonization of the Americas, any process of resistance and decolonization must be ecological, too. It’s in poetry and fiction that the imagination for such a thing could take root—and Catrileo understands this well.Chilco’s imagistic and documentary structure, its radical mixture of poetry and fiction, is held together by the novel’s emphasis on the ecology of the island—the presence of the ocean, the fuchsia plant from which Chilco derives its name, Mari’s pleasure at settling into a place through understanding its flora.

At the same time, it is a novel on which contemporary Indigenous realities weigh heavy. In their own ways, both Mari and Pascale live with “the brokenness-of-being that is Indigeneity,” in Belcourt’s words again, and with the questions of belonging that being mixed-race foments. A happy ending, Catrileo seems to tell us as she pulls out the rug from under their hard-won domestic bliss, was made impossible long ago. For her and her characters, it’s not the future that flashes tantalizingly on the horizon, but the possibility of truly going home."

Lindsey Langston, a Florida Republican state committeewoman and the current titleholder for the Miss United States beauty pageant, has filed a restraining order against the Republican lawmaker, reportedDropSite News. The pair dated from November 2021 until February of this year.

The Columbia County committeewoman reported Mills to local and state law enforcement for “harassment, threatening to release sexual videos, and to harm future boyfriends,” according to DropSite.

After dating for almost three years, Langston and Mills began living together last summer when Langston moved into Mills’s Florida home. But that all came to an abrupt end in February when Langston learned—via national news reports—that Mills not only had a second girlfriend but had also beenaccused of assaulting herat his D.C. condo. (The second girlfriend, Sarah Raviani, laterdeniedthe report.)

But ending the relationship didn’t translate to an end in communication, according to Langston, who told DropSite that Mills continued to harass her for months despite her telling him repeatedly to leave her alone.

“The threats from Cory intensified over time,” she told DropSite. “From emotional manipulation, to physical violence against whoever I date in the future, to threats of having me stripped of the Miss United States crown … something I worked extremely hard for and a dream that was placed in my heart long before I even knew who Cory Mills was.”

Langston shared troves of time-stamped evidence with local and state investigators, as well as DropSite News, to back up her allegations.

On May 19, Donald Trump signed into law the bipartisan “Take It Down Act” to curb revenge porn. That same day, Mills—a self-styled MAGA Republican who hadvoted in favorof the anti-intimidation legislation—sent another timely message to Langston, threatening to blow up her future yet again by weaponizing sexual images he had of her.

“Let him put his actions behind his mouth,” Mills wrote, referring to someone he believed to be Langston’s new partner. “I can send him a few videos of you as well. Oh, I still have them.”"

Loomer, the self-annointed Trump“loyalty”enforcerwhose influence with the presidenthas seemingly risen in recent months, sat down for a deposition last week with HBO’s attorney. And,as Puck reported, it quickly became “every bit as unhinged as one might expect.”

The lawsuit, whichLoomer filed in Octoberof last year, centers on a September 2024 episode ofReal Timewhere thecomic suggestedthat Loomer’s sudden ascendance in Trump’s orbit was due to the two of them engaging in a sexual liaison.

“I think maybe Laura Loomer’s in an arranged relationship to affect the election because she’s very close to Trump. She’s 31, looks like his type,” Maher quipped. “We did an editorial here a few years ago… it was basically, who’s Trump f***ing? Because I said, you know, it’s not nobody. He’s been a dog for too long, and it’s not Melania. I think we may have our answer this week. I think it might be Laura Loomer.”

In her complaint, Loomer alleges that she was subjected to “unjustified ridicule, embarrassment, loss of reputation and professional opportunity, as well as being damaged financially” by the joke, adding that the comments were “false, malicious and defamatory.” She also claimed that Maher denied her request for a public apology and an invitation on his show to “mitigate prior and any further damage.”

Maher’s joke, meanwhile, came days after Loomer accompanied the then-candidate to a presidential debate and events commemorating the 9/11 attacks, prompting concerns from advisers and allies about her unofficial campaign role.During the final days of the campaign, he would publicly distance himself from her, all while promising his aides that he’d stop regularly inviting her on his flights.

During her deposition, which was briefly on the public docket last week before being sealed by Magistrate Judge Philip Lammens, Loomer looked to make the case that she would currently be working in the White House if it weren’t for Maher.

Throughout the questioning from attorney Kate Bolger, Loomer boasted about her increasing clout with the president, stating that he first became impressed with her adversarial “reporting” on GOP presidential rival Ron DeSantis in 2023.

Loomer noted that she would soon be invited to Mar-a-Lago and that Trump told Susie Wiles, his current White House chief of staff, to immediately hire her. Instead, Loomer stated, that didn’t happen becausethe news was leaked to theNew York Times, which reported that her hiring “would cause a backlash, given her history of inflammatory statements and her embrace of the Republican Party’s fringes.” TheTimeslater appended the story to point out its reporting had “ignited a firestorm” among the MAGA base and resulted in Trump backing off.

Still, according to Loomer, she continued to enjoy access in Trumpworld and estimated that she’d visited Mar-a-Lago at least “20,30 times,” flew around with Trump, and submitted a resume for an administration job. She also recalled that on the flight to Trump’s debate with Kamala Harris in Philadelphia, she showed him what she said was a police report after he asked if the rumors about Haitian immigrants in Ohio were real, leading to the infamous “eating dogs” moment.

Bolger, meanwhile, pressed Loomer on why she was so certain it was Maher’s joke – which came days after the debate – that doomed her job prospects with the president.

“Other than Bill Maher, can you name a single human being on all of Planet Earth that believes what Bill Maher said?” Bolger asked, prompting Loomer to respond: “It’s up for interpretation.”

Loomer went on to say that Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita would later tell her she wasn’t welcome back on Trump’s plane because of the “media frenzy” the HBO host’s joke had sparked.

Elsewhere in the deposition, Bolger brought up the lengthy history of inflammatory commentary from Loomer, a self-described “proud Islamophobe” who has made numerous accusations about the personal lives of other prominent political figures. This could have potentially been an effort to establish that Maher’s one-off line about Loomer wouldn’t have done any meaningful reputational damage to the far-right provocateur.

That did lead Loomer to bring up her ongoing feud with fellow MAGA firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom Loomer accused of being “very jealous of me” and not well-liked by Trump’s staff.

Naturally, a sitdown with Loomer wouldn’t be complete without a nasty swipe, which Bolger received when the plaintiff took aim at her past representation of Disney in the ABC News lawsuit that was settled with Trump. “I’m not going to be gaslit by a Democratic lawyer who represents fake news media,” Loomer fumed.

While Loomer may not have a White House job, and the six-figure salary that comes with it, she has been patting herself on the back lately over the amount of influence she supposedly wields with the president.

Claiming to haveplayed an outsized role in the abrupt firingsofmore than a dozen high-ranking administration officialsover what she says is insufficient loyalty to the president, who she has repeatedly declared her “love” for, Loomerrecently jokedthat one of her friends now calls her “Trump’s Rasputin.”"
