    "News_title":"A volunteer finds the Holy Grail of abolitionist-era Baptist documents in Massachusetts",
    "News_text":"GROTON, Mass. (AP) — Jennifer Cromack was combing through the American Baptist archive when she uncovered a slim box among some 18th and 19th century journals. Opening it, she found a scroll in pristine condition.\n\nA closer look revealed the 5-foot-long (1.5-meter-long) document was a handwritten declaration titled “A Resolution and Protest Against Slavery,\" signed by 116 New England ministers inBostonand adopted March 2, 1847. Until its discovery in May at the archives in Groton, Massachusetts, American Baptist officials worried theanti-slavery documenthad been lost forever after fruitless searches at Harvard andBrown universitiesand other locations. A copy was last seen in a 1902 history book.\n\n“I was just amazed and excited,” Cromack, a retired teacher who volunteers at the archive, said. “We made a find that really says something to the people of the state and the people in the country. ... It speaks of their commitment to keeping people safe and out of situations that they should not be in.\"\n\nThe document offers a glimpse into an emerging debate over slavery in the 19th century in the Northeast. The document was signed 14 years before the start of the Civil War as a growing number of religious leaders were starting to speak out against slavery.\n\nSplit over slavery\n\nThe document also shines a spotlight on a critical moment in the history ofthe Baptist church.\n\nIt was signed two years after the issue of slavery prompted southern Baptists to split from northern Baptists and form theSouthern Baptist Convention,the nation’s largest Protestant denomination. The split in 1845 followed a ruling by the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society prohibiting slave owners from becoming missionaries. The northern Baptists eventually became American Baptist Churches USA.\n\n“It comes from such a critical era in American history, you know, right prior to the Civil War,” said the Rev. Mary Day Hamel, the executive minister of the American Baptist Churches of Massachusetts.\n\n“It was a unique moment in history when Baptists in Massachusetts stepped up and took a strong position and stood for justice in the shaping of this country,” she said. “That’s become part of our heritage to this day, to be people who stand for justice, for American Baptists to embrace diversity.”\n\nA risky declaration\n\nDeborah Bingham Van Broekhoven, the executive director emerita of the American Baptist Historical Society, said many Americans at the time, especially in the North, were “undecided” about slavery and weren't sure how to respond or were worried about speaking out.\n\n“They thought it was a southern problem, and they had no business getting involved in what they saw as the state’s rights,” Van Broekhoven said. “Most Baptists, prior to this, would have refrained from this kind of protest. This is a very good example of them going out on a limb and trying to be diplomatic.”\n\nThe document shows ministers had hoped “some reformatory movement” led by those involved in slavery would make their action “unnecessary,” but that they felt compelled to act after they “witnessed with painful surprise, a growing disposition to justify, extend and perpetuate their iniquitous system.”\n\n“Under these circumstances we can no longer be silent,” the document states. “We owe something to the oppressed as well as to the oppressor, and justice demands the fulfillment of that obligation. Truth and Humanity and Public Virtue, have claims upon us which we cannot dishonor.”\n\nThe document explains why the ministers “disapprove and abhor the system of American slavery.”\n\n“With such a system we can have no sympathy,” the document states. “After a careful observation of its character and effects and making every deduction with the largest charity can require, we are constrained to regard it as an outrage upon the rights and happiness of our fellow men, for which there is no valid justification or apology.”\n\nWho signed the document?\n\nThe Rev. Diane Badger, the administrator of the American Baptist Church of Massachusetts who oversees the archive, teamed up with the Rev. John Odams of the First Baptist Church in Boston to identify what she called the “Holy Grail” of abolitionist-era Baptist documents. Her great-grandfather was an American Baptist minister.\n\nSince its discovery, Badger has put all the ministers' names on a spreadsheet along with the names of the churches where they served. Among them was Nathaniel Colver, of Tremont Temple in Boston, one of the first integrated churches in the country, now known as Tremont Temple Baptist Church. Another was Baron Stow, who belonged to the state's anti-slavery society.\n\nBadger also is working to estimate the value of the document, which is intact with no stains or damage, and is making plans to ensure it is protected. A digital copy could eventually be shared with some of Massachusetts' 230 American Baptist churches.\n\n“It’s been kind of an interesting journey and it’s one that’s still unfolding,” Badger said. “The questions that always come to me, OK, I know who signed it but who didn’t? I can go through my list, through my database and find who was working where on that and why didn’t they sign that. So it’s been very interesting to do the research.”\n\nThe Rev. Kenneth Young — whose predominantly Black Calvary Baptist Church in Haverhill, Massachusetts, was created by freed Blacks in 1871 — called the discovery inspiring.\n\n“I thought it was awesome that we had over hundred signers to this, that they would project that freedom for our people is just,” Young said. “It follows through on the line of the abolitionist movement and fighting for those who may not have had the strength to fight for themselves against a system of racism.”\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published on July 3, 2025. It was updated on July 4, 2025 to correct that the document shed light on the debate over slavery in the 19th century, not the 18th century.",

    "News_title":"Scientists astonished by highly toxic feature found in popular vape products: 'So high I thought our instrument was broken'",
    "News_text":"A new study has revealed a deeply troubling health risk hidden inside some of the most popular disposable vapes on the market — one that researchers say could be even more dangerous than traditional cigarettes.\n\nAccording to the research, from theUniversity of California, Davis, several disposable vape brands emit lead, nickel, and antimony at levels far above safety limits — with one device releasing more lead in a single day than nearly 20 packs of cigarettes.\n\nPublished inACS Central Science, the study tested seven devices from three well-known disposable vape brands. Using a lab instrument that mimicked 500 to 1,500 puffs, researchers found that metal concentrations in the vapor increased with each use.\n\n\"When I first saw the lead concentrations, they were so high I thought our instrument was broken,\" said lead authorMark Salazar. That discovery launched a deeper analysis, uncovering that metals were either present in the e-liquid itself or leaching from internal components like leaded bronze parts and degrading heating coils.\n\nFour devices emitted nickel and lead at levels that surpassed thresholds for neurological and respiratory harm. Two exceededcancer risk limitsdue to high antimony levels — a known carcinogen.\n\nThese devices are especially popular with teens and young adults — the same group most vulnerable to the effects of heavy metal exposure, including long-term damage to brain development and lung function.\n\nMany of the disposable vapes tested are also technically illegal in the U.S. but continue to flood the market through online sellers and unregulated distributors. The speed at which new products hit the shelves has far outpaced both regulation and scientific research.\n\nOn top of health risks, disposable vapes pose a serious environmental challenge. With built-in batteries, plastic casings, and metal parts, they are notoriously difficult to recycle — often ending up in landfills, where they can leak toxins into the environment.\n\nWhile stronger regulations are essential, there are meaningful steps individuals can take to protect themselves and their communities.

    "News_title":"Green crab discoveries in Ketchikan show the invasive threat is spreading in Alaska",
    "News_text":"The European green crab, as pictured here, is an invasive species that threatens native fish populations. The invasive crabs were first discovered in Alaska in 2022 at Annette Island, and their numbers in the state have grown dramatically. In June, their shells were found in Ketchikan. (Photo by Emily Grason\/Washington Sea Grant)\n\nOn a sandy beach in a state park in Ketchikan, a group of local beachcombers encountered something ominous: shells of two invasive European green crabs, shed as part of the creatures’ growth process.\n\nThatdiscovery, made during a June 6 beach survey that was part of a class held by the University of Alaska Southeast Ketchikan campus, led to more in the community.\n\nIt makes Ketchikan the newest known Alaska beachhead in a northward invasion of non-native crabs that are known to wreak havoc on native species and habitats.\n\nEuropean green crabs, firstconfirmedto be in Alaska when their shells werediscovered in 2022on Annette Island in the far southeast corner of the state, are likely here for good, said the UAS professor who was one of the class instructors and helped lead the beach surveys.\n\n“They have continued to spread. They will continue to spread,” said Barbara Morgan, who isbased in Ketchikan. “They are expected to spread through Southeast Alaska, probably most of Southcentral — kind of the southern coast of Southcentral. And maybe, depending on water temperature and how tolerant they are to the colder water temperatures, they might go up into the really southern part of the Bristol Bay area, too.”\n\nIn time, they could threaten some of Alaska’s most important habitats for salmon and other fish.\n\nThe crabs eat salmon fry, juvenile native crabs like Dungeness and other fish, and they mow down eelgrass beds that are important Alaska fish habitat.\n\n“Green crab could potentially damage Alaska’s multi-billion dollar fisheries industries, especially for salmon, crab, and mariculture operations,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration haswarned.\n\nEuropean green crabs werefirst foundin waters of the U.S. East Coast in the 1800s, believed to have been transported in ships’ ballast water. In 1989, the first green crabs were discovered in U.S. West Coast waters, also believed to have been carried accidentally in ballast water. Over the following years, they spread northward. The first sightings inBritish Columbiawere in 1998.\n\nThe Alaska first discovery, at Annette Island, was about 30 miles south of the beach site where Morgan’s class found the crab shells in June. And last summer, green crab shells were found at Gravina Island, just west of Ketchikan.\n\nAn eventual discovery in Ketchikan was largely expected. But the precise site of the June 6 discovery — atRefuge Cove State Recreation Site— was a bit surprising because of the nature of the site, Morgan said.\n\nGreen crabs generally prefer estuarine areas, places where freshwater and saltwater meet, and places with thick eelgrass, she said. But the Refuge Cove beach site is sandy and not an estuary, and thus not considered to be a prime spot for the crabs.\n\nCrabs’ upper shells, called carapaces, are discarded periodically as the animals grow and need larger shells. Discovery of the molted shells suggests that the invasive crab were in the larval stage when they were pushed by currents north to Alaska, Morgan said.\n\nAfter the first two shells were found during the class survey, the discoveries in the community “snowballed,” with additional shells found at Refuge Cove, plus more at other sites along the Ketchikan road system, she said. It is likely that there are more at other sites that are less accessible for surveys, she said.\n\nThe species’ name can be confusing because the crabs are not necessarily green, Morgan said. They can be brown or yellow or reddish, or a mixture of colors, she said. Meanwhile, some native crabs that do belong in Alaska are green, including kelp crabs, and should not be mistaken for the invaders, she said.\n\nThe “European” part of the name is not accurate, either, she said. “Yes, they came from Europe; they’re not in Europe anymore,” she said.\n\nMorgan and other invasive species experts are trying to spread awareness — and the message about what the crabs look like. Telltale signs come from the shape of the shells, which have three bumps between the crabs’ eyes and five spikes on either side.\n\nThe Metlakatla Indian Community, a Tribal government on Annette Island, has been particularly active in combatting European green crabs.\n\nThe Tribe established a detection program in 2020 and made the first discovery of shells in 2022, as well as the Gravina Island discoveries last year.\n\nThrough its program, the Tribe has also trapped thousands of European green crabs. The total had reached about 3,000 as of last summer, according to the Department of Fish and Game, and it continues to grow.\n\nIn just the past month, the Tribal team trapped over 300 of the live crabs on Gravina Island, said Ian Hudson, a fisheries biologist who coordinates the Tribe’s European green crab program.\n\n“This year there has been an explosion in numbers, and we’re not at all surprised that Ketchikan is finding carapace,” he said by email.\n\nMetlakatla’s efforts are highlighted in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s2023-2028 planfor combatting European green crabs. That plan lays out steps for prevention, early detection, rapid response and control.\n\nBut by now, full prevention may not be possible anymore, Morgan said.\n\nWith millions of European green crabs on the West Coast, and with currents that continue t send their larvae north, it is highly unlikely that all incursions could be prevented, she said.\n\n“Even if we get rid of all of them in Alaska, we would need to build a fence across Dixon Entrance, a fine net. And that’s obviously not going to happen,” she said, referring to the maritime border site between Canada and Alaska.\n\nInstead, she said, “functional eradication” like what the Metlakatla Indian Tribe is doing with trapping is likely to be increasingly important, with focuses on key sites important to native species like salmon and Dungeness crab. Baseline surveys can help identify those areas that need to be most protected, she said.\n\nWhile the European green crab is considered to be among the world’s most damaging invasive species, it is not the only one that threatens Alaska’s environment and fishing industry.\n\nAnother example is elodea, a freshwater plant often used in aquariums. First found in Eyak Lake in Cordova in 1982, it has spread to other lakes and streams in Southcentral and Interior Alaska. Potential economic losses — to commercial sockeye salmon and to recreational floatplane pilots — could be well over $1 billion, Tobias Schwoerer, a University of Alaska Fairbanks economist,estimated in a 2017 study.\n\nInvasive northern pike in Southcentral Alaska, which have proved to bepersistent, also pose ecological and economic threats. The fish prey on salmon, trout and other native species. The Department of Fish and Game has aprogramto remove invasive pike and try to limit their spread.\n\nFor now, much of the work to combat nonnative species is coordinated by the Alaska Invasive Species Partnership, a coalition of government agencies, university experts, nonprofits and community organizations.\n\nThe partnership has advocated for years for the establishment of a more robust organization within state government, an invasive species council, to organize wider protection and rapid response, if needed.\n\nBills pending in the Alaska Legislature would do that. One measure,House Bill 191, made it through one committee. A Senate version,Senate Bill 174, had two hearings.\n\nIn past years, similar bills progressed through the Legislature but failed to make it to final passage. The most recent was in 2022, when a bill to establish a state invasive species councilpassed the Houseby 33-2 margin but failed to reach the Senate floor before that session’s adjournment.\n\nProponents hope results in the coming session will be more successful.\n\nThe sponsor of the current House bill, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, worries not only about green crabs moving their way through Southeast Alaska but also invasive plants like knotweed that have appeared in important community spots like Harbor Mountain.\n\n“Each year, there’s more knotweed and less salmonberries,” she said in an interview late in the session. She hopes the bill will win final passage next year, she said.\n\nSen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage, is another proponent of an invasive species council.\n\nHe said he has been aware of invasive species since his childhood in Cordova, where he and a friend earned money from a neighbor by killing invasive black slugs at about a nickel apiece. Later, as a member of the Anchorage Assembly, he worked on efforts to remove invasivechokecherry trees, which were introduced as ornamentals but have since crowded out native species along the city’s greenbelts.\n\nDunbar acknowledged concerns that an invasive species council would cost the state money because it would require a dedicated employee in the Department of Fish and Game. But he argues that failing to set up such a council would cause more expense in the long run.\n\n“I would say, we can’t afford to not prevent invasive species from entering Alaska,” Dunbar said in an interview near the end of this year’s session. “It is very expensive to have invasive species to start pushing out native species.”\n\nCorrection: The article incorrectly stated the number of hearings that Senate Bill 174 had. It had two.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_title":"The New Rules of Media Under Trump",
    "News_text":"On June 7, months into Paramount’s negotiations to settle a $20 billion lawsuit over CBS’60 Minutes, President Trump was spotted ringside at an UFC event in Newark, New Jersey. All the usual suspects came to greet him, including Marco Rubio, Mike Tyson and Joe Rogan. So did Hunter Campbell, UFC president Dana White’s lieutenant who later brokered a meeting for Skydance CEO David Ellison to talk with Trump.\n\nJust a few feet away from the ring, Ellison bowed his head to hear Trump as the announcer blared introductions for the bout’s fighters. Campbell, sandwiched between the two, wrapped his arms around both of their shoulders, his head swiveling as he acted like something of a conduit for the back-and-forth. At one point, he gave up his seat to allow for a second round of talks that ended with Ellison extending his arm for a handshake with Trump, who appeared to accept the olive branch.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nParamount and Trump in \"Advanced\" Settlement Talks As Merger Deadline Nears\n\nCanada Scraps Digital Services Tax After Trump Trade Talks Threat\n\nTrump \"Terminating\" U.S.-Canada Trade Talks Over Streaming Tax\n\nSince then, chatter has swirled that the informal meeting juiced talks to greenlight Skydance’s pending merger with Paramount by finding an acceptable framework for a settlement of Trump’s lawsuit. Such are the new rules of media in this regime: Everything starts and ends with Trump; everything goes through him.\n\nLess than two weeks after the discussion, Trump signaled support for Ellison’s takeover of Paramount. When asked about the deal and whether he believes that it’ll be resolved soon, he replied: “I hope so.”\n\n“Ellison’s great,” Trump added. “He’ll do a great job with it.”\n\nThe settlementcame to passlate on July 1 when Paramount announced a $16 million deal to resolve the lawsuit. It involves an agreement from the company, which will not apologize, to release60 Minutestranscripts of interviews with presidential candidates after they’ve aired, according to a statement from the company.\n\nAnd with the deal, a pathway to approval of Paramount’s sink-or-swim merger with Skydance has emerged. It shines a spotlight on the power that Trump wields over dealmaking and regulatory matters in decisions with the potential to transform the long-term trajectory of a company. Media execs are on notice: Jeff BezosrevampedThe Washington Post‘s opinion section to bring it more in line with Rupert Murdoch’sWall Street Journal; Bob Iger allowedABC News’ settlementof a defamation lawsuit from Trump,reportedThe New York Times;Los Angeles Timesowner Patrick Soon-Shiongshiftedthe paper’s strategy to increasingly platform conservative views.\n\n“Paramount’s spineless decision to settle Trump’s baseless and patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the journalists of60 Minutesand an invitation to Trump to continue targeting other news outlets,” says Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “Each time a company cowers and surrenders to Trump’s demands, [it] only emboldens him to do it again.”\n\nYes, there will be legal blowback. The Freedom of the Press Foundation, represented by prominent Washington litigator Abbe David Lowell, sent to Paramount on Wednesday a demand for information related to its decision to settle, with plans to file a lawsuit on behalf of investors against controlling shareholder Shari Redstone and the board. Related are potential investigations by lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren into whether Paramount violated anti-bribery laws, though there’s skepticism about how those legal actions will fare.\n\n“It’s not good enough to say abstractly that this was a bribe,” says Ann Lipton, professor of business law at Tulane University Law School. “People settle frivolous lawsuits to get rid of them all the time.”\n\nThat line of argument was echoed by Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks at a shareholder meeting Wednesday. “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,” he said.\n\nWith Trump loyalists at the head of various regulatory agencies, expect more of the same. Any green light from the FCC, FTC or DOJ in deals being reviewed will likely involve concessions. That includes new Paramount, which may have to agree to promote more conservative perspectives moving forward for the FCC to approve transferal of broadcast licenses.\n\nThat tactic, designed to stymie what the Trump administration considers political bias in corporate America and mainstream outlets, was seen last month in a consent decree from advertising giants Omnicom and IPG with the FTC to get their $13 billion megamerger across the finish line. In a highly unusual move weaponizing antitrust laws to regulate private companies’ business choices and free speech rights, the FTC conditioned approval of the transaction on an agreement not to boycott media platforms because of their political content. The deal came after the FTC opened an investigation into whether advertisers and watchdog groups conspired to withhold advertising money from platforms and websites with conservative leanings.\n\n“Coordination among advertising agencies to suppress advertising spending on publications with disfavored political or ideological viewpoints threatens to distort not only competition between ad agencies, but also public discussion and debate,” Daniel Guarnera, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.\n\nThe likes of Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney and Comcast — all of which have significant media holdings — could choose to forgo dealmaking for the remainder of Trump’s term, but it’s uncertain if that’s an option. NBCUniversal (MSNBC, CNBC) and WBD (CNN) are currently racing to offload their ailing linear TV channels, which could require some kind of regulatory approval to ensure compliance with licensing regimes. It remains to be seen whether the FCC and SEC plant their flags over those transactions.\n\nIn this regime, there’s immense value in having a direct line to Trump or knowing someone who does. Exhibit A: In the weeks leading up to the election, tech C-suites cozied up to Trump, who fielded calls from Google’s Sundar Pichai and Apple’s Tim Cook, as detailed byTheWall Street Journal.Around that time, WBD CEO David Zaslav and Elon Musk were seen sitting next to each other at the U.S. Open. By their thinking, why should they go through Justice Department antitrust division chief Gail Slater, who continues to pursue antitrust cases against Google and Apple, when they can go straight to the person who appointed — and can fire — her?\n\nNotably, Ellison’s father, Oracle scion Larry Ellison, is believed to be the mogul closest to Trump. Earlier this year, he was front and center at the White House for an announcement of a project to build artificial intelligence data centers. And when asked if Musk could buy TikTok, Trump replied, “I’d like Larry to buy it too.” The elder Ellison, who in 2020 hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his golf course in Southern California and later sat in on a transition meeting at Mar-a-Lago, put up most of the $8 billion bid to buy Paramount.\n\nThen there’s the issue of federal funding for public broadcasters, like NPR and PBS. Trump is maneuvering to slash $1.1 billion for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funnels money to more than 1,500 public television and radio stations across the country.

The union also put out a photo of Caceres in handcuffs — questionable since DOC policy bars photos in the jails, especially of people in custody.\n\nCOBA President Benny Boscio declared, “The fact that this attorney would brazenly attempt to smuggle in a large quantity of THC is further proof paper documents should be scanned.”\n\nDOC spokeswoman Annais Morales said the agency “applaud[s] the members of our K9 Unit who were able to prevent this contraband from coming into the jails.”\n\nBut the facts turned against Boscio and DOC, as the subsequent lab tests proved there were no narcotics whatsoever on the papers, a law enforcement source said.\n\nCaceres said his client DeJesus was in the middle of trial on robbery charges and he was at Rikers that day to prep him for his testimony.\n\nThe arrest led to the postponement of the trial and Caceres’ withdrawal from the case. It may be months before the trial can begin again. DeJesus also faced charges based on the faulty field test.\n\n“I had been representing him for over two years, he’s been in Rikers for a year,” Caceres said. “We had picked a jury and he had a right to see his discovery.

    "News_title":"CBS News’ John Dickerson Takes on Trump Settlement: “Can You Hold Power to Account After Paying It Millions?”",
    "News_text":"How did CBS News cover the settlement between its parent company Paramount Global and President Donald Trump? It addressed it head-on, in a blunt piece of commentary fromCBS Evening Newsanchor John Dickerson on Wednesday’s newscast.\n\nDickerson, who wasnamed co-anchorof the newscast earlier this year alongside Maurice DuBois, told viewers that “the Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nElizabeth Warren Calls for Bribery Investigation Into Paramount-Trump Settlement as Blowback Widens\n\nInside CBS News, Staffers Voice Disgust, Anger, Relief and Anxiety After Trump Settlement\n\nParamount Settles Lawsuit With Trump Over Kamala Harris '60 Minutes' Interview for $16 Million\n\n“Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?” he continued. “The audience will decide that.”\n\nIn amidnight settlement, CBS owner Paramount Global reached a deal with President Trump over a60 Minutesinterview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The settlementsparked anger and anxiety within CBS News, given the nature of the complaint, which was about how the CBS newsmagazine edited the Harris interview. The only saving grace was that the settlement did not include an apology, a line that many at CBS News were worried the company would be willing to cross.\n\nIn his commentary, Dickerson began by reporting the news, before digging into the context of trust, and why it matters at CBS specifically.\n\n“Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, settled a suit with President Trump today,” Dickerson said to begin the segment. “Journalists don’t like to report on themselves. Sometimes that’s false humility. Mostly, it’s a practical limitation. Reporters try to find order in chaos. We prefer to explain the cause of a bombing, the intent of a bill, the marvel of a new discovery. Putting chaos in preliminary order helps viewers make sense of their world. They tell us this, at airports, restaurants, at church. The audience brings us their fears, their questions, their good-faith view of things. It reminds us that we are stewards of that concern. It’s a grace to receive another’s trust, but also to have a mission that shapes your work; mission, that can sound grandiose.\n\n“We are not all that. Public figures have taught us that misguided mission can do more harm than brute force,” he continued. “We pride ourselves on our B.S. detector, so it ought to work on ourselves too. When it doesn’t, the stakes are real, a loss of public trust, the spread of misinformation. A visitor to our newsrooms might wonder why we debate a single word for so long, why it takes hours to answer the simple question: What is this story about? Why there’s a cry of frustration when a detail is off by an inch? That is what work looks like when it is deeply felt, when the audience’s concerns become ours, passed by bucket brigade from the subjects of our stories, to correspondents, to producers, to editors, fact checkers and writers.\n\n“The obstacles to getting it right are many. The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle. Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust? The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up to honor what we witness on behalf of the people we witness it for. The network’s first heroes ran to rooftops during the bombing of London.

    "News_title":"CBS’ John Dickerson Says Trump Settlement Jeopardizes Network Holding ‘Power to Account After Paying It Millions’ | Video",
    "News_text":"“CBS Evening News” anchor John Dickerson used Wednesday’s show to address the elephant in the room. Dickerson took a portion of the news program to talk about the $16 million settlement CBS parent company Paramount made with President Donald Trump.\n\n“The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle. Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?” Dickerson wondered aloud in his Reporter’s Notebook segment. “The audience will decide that. Our job is to show up to honor what we witness on behalf of the people.”\n\nMore from TheWrap\n\nWho Dies (and How) in ‘Squid Game’ Season 3?\n\nVivica A. Fox, Jennifer Tilly and More Celebs Remember Michael Madsen: ‘Mischief Wrapped in Tenderness’\n\n‘The Whole Story With Anderson Cooper’ Sets Saturday Specials on Diddy Verdict, Idaho Murders at CNN\n\nDiogo Jota, Liverpool Football Star, Dies at 28: Cristiano Ronaldo and More Pro Athletes Pay Tribute\n\nDickerson’s commentary marks a break in ranks, as the CBS reporter publicly discussed the actions of his parent company. Plus, his sentiments could very well be shared by many newspeople under the Paramount umbrella.\n\nTrump sued Paramount over the pre-election airing of a “60 Minutes” interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Trump asserted that the segment was edited in such a light to boost Harris’ profile and make her look better, while simultaneously causing him “mental anguish.”\n\nDickerson acknowledged the strange position he’s been put in since, using his platform to comment on the ramifications of a fellow CBS news program. Still, he felt the story was too significant to ignore as a reporter (the segment was included on Paramount+, but did not technically air on TV).\n\n“Journalists don’t like to report on themselves. Sometimes that’s false humility. Mostly, it’s a practical limitation. Reporters try to find order in chaos. We prefer to explain the cause of a bombing, the intent of a bill, the marvel of a new discovery. Putting chaos in preliminary order helps viewers make sense of their world,” Dickerson said. “They tell us this, at airports, restaurants, at church — the audience brings us their fears, their questions, their good faith view of things. It reminds us that we are stewards of that concern. It’s a grace to receive another’s trust, but also to have a mission that shapes your work.Mission. That can sound grandiose.”\n\nTrump initially sued Paramount for $20 billion over the “60 Minutes” editing. The $16 million settlement will help cover “plaintiffs’ fees and costs,” with the remainder being donated toward a “future presidential library.” “60 Minutes” will also release transcripts of interviews with U.S. presidential candidates going forward. However, an apology from CBS and Paramount was not included in the settlement.\n\nDickerson further asserted that the interview “was done in accordance with long-held CBS News standards and widely accepted journalistic practices.” In the light of such a settlement, he commented on the fallibility of both reporters and their parent organizations.\n\n“We are not all that. Public figures have taught us that misguided mission can do more harm than brute force. We pride ourselves on our BS detector, so it ought to work on ourselves, too. When it doesn’t, the stakes are real — a loss of public trust, the spread of misinformation,” he said. “A visitor to our newsrooms might wonder why we debate a single word for so long, why it takes hours to answer the simple question, ‘What is this story about?’ Why there’s a cry of frustration when a detail is off by an inch. That is what work looks like when it is deeply felt, when the audience’s concerns become ours, passed by bucket brigade from the subjects of our stories, to correspondence, to producers, to editors, fact checkers and writers.”\n\nThis week’s settlement is one of a growing number made between news organizations and Trump over their reporting. Given the president’s often aggressive stance toward reporters and publications — those he labels as “fake news” — reporters are beginning to fear that content may be overly moderated to avoid potential court hangups.\n\nStill, Dickerson concluded his segment by urging reporters and audiences alike to stay the course.\n\n“The network’s first heroes ran to rooftops during the bombing of London. Its current ones carry that same instinct,” he said. “But another story from CBS’s early days also captures this spirit. The young correspondent was filing a story when it started to rain. The takes they’d already filmed were fine. Everybody could have just gone inside, but she persisted the rain, turning the notes in her hand to pulp. Again and again, she worked to get it right. This wasn’t London under the fire. It was just a regular story. That’s the point.”\n\n“So, the rain has picked up, but we’ll stay at it. We hope you will, too. See you tomorrow.”\n\nThe postCBS’ John Dickerson Says Trump Settlement Jeopardizes Network Holding ‘Power to Account After Paying It Millions’ | Videoappeared first on TheWrap.",

    "News_title":"Astronomers have discovered another puzzling interstellar object − this third one is big, bright and fast",
    "News_text":"Astronomers manningan asteroid warning systemcaught a glimpse of a large, bright object zipping through the solar systemlate on July 1, 2025. The object’s potentially interstellar origins excited scientists across the globe, and the next morning, theEuropean Space Agency confirmedthat this object, first named A11pl3Z andthen designated 3I\/ATLAS, is the third ever found from outside our solar system.\n\nCurrent measurements estimate that 3I\/ATLAS isabout 12 miles (20 kilometers) wide, and while its path won’t take it close to Earth, it could hold clues about the nature of aprevious interstellar objectand about planet formation in solar systems beyond ours.\n\nOn July 2 at 3 p.m. EDT, Mary Magnuson, an associate science editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke toDarryl Z. Seligman, an astrophysicist at Michigan State University who has been studying 3I\/ATLAS since its discovery.\n\nWhat makes 3I\/ATLAS different from its predecessors?\n\nWe have discovered two interstellar objects so far, ’Oumuamua and Comet 2I\/Borisov.’Oumuamua had no dust tailand a significant nongravitational acceleration, which led to a widevariety of hypothesesregarding its origin.2I\/Borisov was very clearly a comet, though it has a somewhat unique composition compared to comets in our solar system.\n\nAll of our preparation for the next interstellar object was preparing for something that looked like a ’Oumuamua, or something that looked like Borisov. And this thing doesn’t look like either of them, which is crazy and exciting.\n\nThis object is shockingly bright, and it’s very far away from the Earth. It issignificantly biggerthan both of the interstellar objects we’ve seen – it is orders of magnitude larger than ’Oumuamua.\n\nFor some context, ’Oumuamua was discovered when it wasvery close to the Earth, but this new object is so large and bright that our telescopes can see it, even though it is still much farther away. This means observatories and telescopes will be able to observe it for much longer than we could for the two previous objects.\n\nIt’s huge and it’s much farther away, but it is also much faster.\n\nWhen I went to bed last night, I saw an alert about this object, but nobody knew what was going on yet. I have a few collaborators who figure out the orbits of things in the solar system, and I expected to wake up to them saying something like “yeah, this isn’t actually interstellar.” Because a lot of times you think you may have found something interesting, but as more data comes in, it becomes less interesting.\n\nThen, when I woke up at 1 a.m., my colleagues who are experts on orbits were saying things like “no, this is definitely interstellar. This is for real.”\n\nHow can astronomers tell if something is an interstellar object?\n\nTheeccentricity of the object’s orbitis how you know that it’s interstellar. The eccentricity refers to how noncircular an orbit is. So an eccentricity of zero is a pure circle, and as the eccentricity increases, it becomes what’s known as an ellipse – a stretched out circle.\n\nAnd then once you get past an eccentricity of one, you go from an ellipse to ahyperbolic orbit, and that is unbound. So while an elliptical orbit is stretched out, it still orbits and comes back around. An object with a hyperbolic orbit comes through and it leaves, but it never comes back. That type of orbit tells you that it didn’t come from this solar system.\n\nWhen researchers are collecting data, they’re getting points of light on the sky, and they don’t know how far away they are. It’s not like they see them and can just tell, “oh, that’s eccentric.” What they’re seeing is how far away the object is compared with other stars in the background, what its position is and how fast it’s moving. And then from that data, they try to fit the orbit.\n\nThis object ismoving fast for how far away it is, and that’s what’s telling us that it could be hyperbolic. If something is moving fast enough, it’ll escape from the solar system. So a hyperbolic, unbound object inherently has to be moving faster.\n\nThis is a real-time process. My collaborators have preexisting software, which will, every night, get new observations of all the small bodies and objects in the solar system. It will figure out and update what the orbits are in real time.We’re getting data points, and with more data we can refine which orbit fits the points best.\n\nWhat can scientists learn from an interstellar object?\n\nObjects like this are pristine, primordial remnants from theplanet formation processin other planetary systems. Thesmall bodies in our solar systemhave taught us quite a lot about how the planets in the solar system formed and evolved. This could be a new window into understanding planet formation throughout the galaxy.\n\nAs we’re looking through the incoming data, we’re trying to figure out whether it’s a comet. In the next couple of weeks, there will likely be way more information available to say if it has a cometary tail like Borisov, or if it has anacceleration that’s not due to a gravitational pull, like ’Oumuamua.\n\nIf it is a comet, researchers really want to figure out whether it’s icy. If it contains ices, that tells you a ton about it. The chemistry of these small bodies is the most important aspect when it comes tounderstanding planet formation, because the chemical composition tells you about the conditions the object’s solar system was in when the object formed.\n\nFor example, if the object has a lot of ices in it, you would know that wherever it came from, it didn’t spend much time near a star, because those ices would have melted. If it has a lot of ice in it, that could tell you that it formed really far away from a star and then got ejected by something massive, such as a planet the size of Jupiter or Neptune.\n\nFundamentally, this object could tell astronomers more about a population of objects that we don’t fully understand, or about the conditions in another solar system.\n\nWe’ve had a couple of hours to get some preliminary observations. I suspect that practically every telescope is going to be looking at this object for the next couple of nights, so we’ll get much more information about it very soon.\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "News_text":"Another CBS News star has joined the revolt against the network’s parent company for bending to President Donald Trump.\n\nJohn Dickerson delivered a scathing monologue on a Wednesday episode ofCBS Evening News Plusafter Paramount Global agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library to end his $20 billion lawsuit over a60 Minutesinterview with Kamala Harris last year.\n\n“We pride ourselves on our BS detector, so it ought to work on ourselves, too,” Dickerson said. “When it doesn’t, the stakes are real: a loss of public trust, the spread of misinformation.”\n\n“The obstacles to getting it right are many,” he went on. “The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle: can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust? The audience will decide that.”\n\nTrump’s lawsuit stemmed from an October 2024 interview that he claimed was deceptively edited by60 Minutesto make Harris’ response to a question about Israel appear more favorable. The program later released afull transcript, revealing that a teaser for the interview showed one portion of her answer while the full episode aired the other. The show said it made a standard editing decision to fit the time slot.\n\n“Reporters try to find order in chaos,” Dickerson said. “We prefer to explain the cause of a bombing, the intent of a bill, the marvel of a new discovery. Putting chaos in preliminary order helps viewers make sense of their world… Our job is to show up, to honor what we witness on behalf of the people we witness it for.”\n\nThough Paramount refused to apologize or express regret, it handed Trump another victory in his crusade against media outlets he perceives as political enemies. Paramount also denied that the settlement had anything to do with a pending merger with Skydance, which will require approval from the Trump administration.\n\nThe company’s decision to cave in has drawn criticism from other big names at CBS, including correspondentBill Whitaker, who conducted the Harris interview, and legendary anchorDan Rather.\n\nWhitaker reportedly appeared “teary-eyed” when he joined a staff meeting after the settlement. Rather branded the settlement an “extortion by the president” and a “kneeling-down and saying, ‘Yes, Sir,’ by billionaire corporate owners.”",

    "News_text":"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nArchaeologists in Bolivia have discovered the ruins of a temple that was built by a little-known civilization up to 1,400 years ago.\n\nThe temple, called Palaspata after the native name for the area, comes from the Tiwanaku civilization, a predecessor of theInca Empire. Tiwanaku society disappeared around 1,000 years ago and little is known about the civilization, but these temple ruins shed light on how it may have functioned in its prime. Analysis of the discovery was published June 24 in the journalAntiquity.\n\n\"It's kind of shocking how little we know\" about the Tiwanaku,Steven Wernke, an archaeologist and historical anthropologist of the Andean region of South America at Vanderbilt University who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. \"This finding is quite significant.\"\n\nThe Tiwanaku civilization, based just south ofLake Titicacain the Andes mountains, was extremely powerful at its peak. \"It boasted a highly organized societal structure, leaving behind remnants of architectural monuments like pyramids, terraced temples and monoliths,\"José Capriles, an anthropological archaeologist at Penn State and lead author of the study, said in astatement.\n\nThe society collapsed around A.D. 1,000, leaving only ruins by the time the Incas entered the region about 400 years later.\n\nThe Tiwanaku are logistically hard to study, even compared to similar civilizations in the region, likethe Wari. Not only are resources for archaeological research limited in Bolivia, but many Tiwanaku sites are at very high altitudes and in remote areas of the Andes. \"It's objectively difficult to document some of these sites,\" Wernke said.\n\nRelated:31 ancient temples from around the world, from Göbekli Tepe to the Parthenon\n\nDespite these obstacles, scientists have gleaned some limited information about the Tiwanaku, like the location of its capital and some offshoots of nearby settlements. But understanding the social, economic and political structures of the society has proved trickier.\n\nThe biggest debate among experts is how the Tiwanaku state was organized, Wernke explained. Some models posit a ruling class of patrimonial Tiwanaku thatoversaw provinces from the capital, while others present the society asa more equitable allianceof diverse peoples across the civilization.\n\nAfter noticing an unmapped plot of land, the researchers conducted uncrewed flights over the area to get better photos. They then used photogrammetry, a technique that combines many digital photos together to create a virtual 3D model, to construct a detailed rendering of the structure. Their analysis found that the stones' alignment revealed a terraced platform temple with four-sided rooms arranged around an inner courtyard, according to the statement.\n\nThe ruins measure roughly 410 by 475 feet (125 by 145 meters) — about the size of a city block — and their structure seems designed for the performance of rituals around thesolar equinox, Capriles said.Radiocarbon datingof charcoal samples from the site showed that it was most intensively occupied from about A.D. 630 to 950, the researchers found.\n\nThe Palaspata temple complex, roughly 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of the previously established Tiwanaku archaeological site, was located strategically. It was built in a spot that linked three diverse trade routes — joining highlands to the north, an arid plateau to the west, and valleys to the east — so researchers believe the temple was, in part, meant to connect people from across the society, according to the statement.\n\nFragments of keru cups, used for drinking a traditional maize beer called \"chicha\" during celebrations, were found within the ruins. These cups suggest the temple may have been a central hub for trade, Capriles said, because the drink requires ingredients from the relatively distant Cochabamba valleys in central Bolivia.\n\n\"This site makes us rethink long-distance connections from Tiwanaku to Cochabamba and further south,\"Erik Marsh, an anthropologist at the National University of Cuyo in Argentina who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n—Gold and silver treasures discovered with 'elite craftspeople' burials near powerful Wari queen's tomb\n\n—73 pre-Incan mummies, some with 'false heads,' unearthed from Wari Empire in Peru\n\n—2,400-year-old puppets with 'dramatic facial expression' discovered atop pyramid in El Salvador\n\nThe temple also likely had religious significance, Capriles explained. \"Most economic and political transactions had to be mediated through divinity, because that would be a common language that would facilitate various individuals cooperating.\"\n\nPalaspata supports the model of a coordinated, centralized Tiwanaku societal structure because of its strategic location, Wernke said.\n\n\"It presents an enticing and exciting new piece of the puzzle about Tiwanaku and early imperialism in the Andes,\" he said. \"It's also certainly not the last piece we'll hear about.\"",

The man, a 54-year-old veteran and former police officer, had been out at Texas Live! as part of treatment for PTSD suggested by his counselor.\n\nDuring the discovery phase of the November trial, lawyers for the injured man asked Texas Live’s security firm, Inner-Parish, to disclose all of the insurance policies it held, according to court documents.\n\nInner-Parish only disclosed one policy worth $1 million, when it actually held an additional policy worth $5 million, according to evidence presented at Wednesday’s hearing.\n\nThe security firm’s failure to produce that policy amounted to an abuse of the discovery process, which is where parties in the case must exchange information and evidence, lawyers for the man argued in court.

    "News_title":"Idaho college killings: Questions remain after stunning guilty plea",
    "News_text":"Bryan Kohbergerhas been behind bars for nearly 1,000 days. All the while, his lawyers had repeatedly insisted he was innocent.\n\nNow that the criminology student accused of killingfourIdahocollege students has insteadpleaded guiltyin a dramatic turn of events, he will almost certainly spend the rest of his days behind bars.\n\nThe guilty plea and admission to the stabbing deaths -- just weeks from the planned start of his trial -- stunned many, in a case that had ceaselessly gripped headlines.\n\nWhat had been seen as a largely circumstantial case was suddenly crystallizing with every admission that Kohberger made to the judge on Wednesday.\n\nBut many questions remained unanswered. While Kohberger admitted to the killings of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin -- students at a school mere miles away from his own and with no apparent connection to him -- many of the details remain a mystery, most notably: why he did it.\n\nIt has been nearly three years since the brutal stabbing deaths of Goncalves, Mogen, Kernodle and Chapin. The grisly crimes sent shockwaves rippling through the tight-knit college town of Moscow, and ignited a continuous firestorm across social and news media.\n\nTheir bodies were found in the girls' off-campus house on King Road on Nov. 13, 2022. Near Mogen's body, a KA-BAR knife sheath was discovered. The knife has never been found.\n\nA more than six-week manhunt ensued, and many residents of the cozy college town began locking their doors at night for the first time. Whether the killer had skipped town – or still lurked among them – was anyone's guess. In the vacuum of real information being shared, conspiracy theorists and true crime hobbyists ran amok with false accusations.\n\nThen one day before New Year's Eve, a criminology Ph.D. student at Washington State University was arrested, more than 2,000 miles from where the killings occurred.\n\nKohberger was taken into custody at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, after driving cross-country to spend the holidays with family. He appeared to have no connection to the victims, save for their schools' proximity. And yet, prosecutors alleged, his DNA had been found on the button snap of the knife sheath.\n\nHis phone pinged off cell towers in the King Road home's area the night the killings occurred, they said. His car was caught on surveillance footage taking multiple passes by what would soon become a crime scene, they said. One of two surviving roommates told police she had seen a masked intruder with \"bushy eyebrows\" that night – a description that has become a hallmark of the case and one, prosecutors said, applied to Kohberger, though his lawyers would later dispute that.\n\nAfter Kohberger's arrest, the lawyer representing him in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, said his client was \"eager to be exonerated of these charges.\" The case was largely circumstantial. There was barely any eyewitness testimony. The murder weapon was missing.\n\nKohberger was extradited to Idaho and indicted in May 2023. He was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary. He is now facing four back-to-back life sentences, as outlined in his plea agreement, for the crimes in addition to 10 years for the burglary count. His sentencing hearing has been set for July 23.\n\nEven before Kohberger was named as a suspect, the murder case captured international attention despite – or perhaps fueled in part by – the heavy shroud of secrecy draped around its details. A strict gag order was imposed early on by the judge first overseeing the case that has forced the case to play out largely behind closed doors.\n\nLittle by little though, the shape of the evidence began to emerge. A slow, steady drip of information has trickled from at-times heated hearings and literally thousands of court filings – and hundreds of thousands of pages of briefs.\n\nMORE: Woman who says she saw Bryan Kohberger near murder scene repeated claim at least four times\n\nFor years, Kohberger's lawyers had aggressively accused prosecutors of failing to do their due diligence onother possible leadsand that they were too single-mindedly focused on their client. They have said investigators used a \"false information trail\" to target Kohberger and even suggested that police intentionally misled a judge to get the search warrants they wanted on Kohberger – a very serious allegation that ultimately went nowhere with the judge.\n\nMeanwhile, the defense has levied a litany of legal salvos trying to puncture holes in prosecutors' case, including casting doubt on theDNA evidence, asking to have the indictment dismissed, and fighting repeatedly to get the death penalty taken off the table on a wide range of grounds, pointing to everything from the U.S. Constitution and international human rights to evolving social norms, to his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis as a factor on jurors' perception, to needing more time for the morass of discovery and intensive preparation they must do in such a capital case. All those attempts were unsuccessful.\n\nIf he had been convicted at trial, Kohberger could have faced execution by firing squad. That capital punishment method is newly legal in Idaho because of the ongoing nationwide shortage of the lethal injection drugs, as major pharmaceutical suppliers have withdrawn from the capital punishment market.\n\nWhat all the legal back-in-forth has succeeded in, however, is continuously pushing back the actual trial – to the frustration of some of the victims' families.\n\nBut those delays in the judicial proceedings could not freeze time. The off-campus home where the killings occurred was demolished in December 2023, after the property owner donated the home to the school. The school made the call to tear it down as a \"healing step,\" they said at the time, despite mixed feelings from the victims' families. The sunrise demolition took less than two hours.\n\nThe Goncalves and Kernodle families had pointed to potential evidentiary value in preserving the house, while the parents of Ethan Chapin – whose brother and sister were still students at the university – were supportive of the demolition.\n\nNeither Kohberger's defense nor prosecutors had pushed back on the planned demolition, and the school said it would help stop \"efforts to further sensationalize the crime scene.\"\n\nLawyers for Kohberger have also denounced what they called \"inflammatory\" and \"prejudicial\" media coverage against their client. The trial, once slated to take place in Latah County, where the killings occurred, wasfinally moved to Boiseafter a long legal battle waged by the defense.\n\nEarly one Sunday morning in September 2024, Kohberger was transported by an Idaho State Police plane from the Latah County Jail, where he had been held, to Ada County. In both facilities, Kohberger has been housed by himself, for his own and others' safety, authorities have said.\n\nHis lawyers had said that Kohberger was driving around alone on the night the killings occurred, and the reason his phone stopped reporting from the network in the critical window when the killings occurred is because he was out in a very remote area, stargazing.\n\nIt's an alibi that both judges who have overseen the case summarily scoffed at: Judge John Judge in Moscow, dubbing it a \"so-called\" alibi; Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, saying \"at this point, [Kohberger] has not provided an alibi, partial or otherwise.\"\n\nSome of the search warrants served on Kohberger's online shopping indicated curiosities far earthlier than the cosmos, prosecutors said. Eight months before four Idaho college students would be found stabbed to death, as ABC News has previously reported, the man accused of the bloody killing spree bought a knife that matches what prosecutors said could be the murder weapon. Kohberger's lawyers, while arguing his innocence, had said the whole Kohberger family had access to that Amazon account.\n\nBut it was Kohberger's buy, prosecutors said. \"He purchased online a KA-BAR knife and sheath with an Amazon gift card,\" prosecutor Bill Thompson said at Wednesday's plea hearing.\n\nMORE: Idaho college victims' friends recall moment they responded to home: 'You know something's wrong'\n\nProsecutors also pointed to Kohberger's own writings, including in their court briefs a homework assignment from his master's degree program that they said was essentially a crime scene how-to guide that showed he had been not just a scholar of crime – he knew how to cover his tracks after committing murder.\n\nIt was a point Thompson explicitly made at Wednesday's plea hearing.\n\n\"The defendant has studied crime. In fact, he did a detailed paper on crime scene processing when he was working on his pre doctorate degrees, and he had that knowledge and skill,\" Thompson said.\n\nMeanwhile as the case dragged on, its cost mushroomed. The financial burden has largely been borne by the local community itself. In 2022, Idaho Governor Brad Little had committed up to $1 million in emergency funds to support the manhunt and investigation, which has helped defray some of the expense. The change in venue to Boise would have also brought additional costs as prosecutors and others would have had to travel more than five hours to Boise for what was expected to be a three-month trial.\n\nNow, that trial, where the actual evidence would finally come to light, will never occur. And at least for now, the case comes to a close much like it started: with still-unanswered questions.\n\nABC News' Josh Margolin and Jim Hill contributed to this report.",

    "News_title":"Too corporate to fight for a free press",
    "News_text":"It just got a lot harder to make the case that any corporation should own a news operation.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, announceda multimillion-dollar agreementwith PresidentDonald Trumpover a “60 Minutes” interview withKamala Harristhat aired in October, a month before the presidential election. Complaining about the show’s edit, Trump baselessly cried “election interference” by the top-rated news broadcast. Later that month, he sued Paramount for $20 billion in damages. On Tuesday, Paramount settled the case for $16 million, an amount that will go toward Trump’s legal fees and future presidential library. The agreed settlement amounts to .08 percent of his original claim. But the damage is priceless.\n\nTrump’s lawsuit was widely considered frivolous. News programs often edit interviews for length and clarity, and as the released transcript shows, Harris’ answers to host Bill Whitaker’s questions about what the U.S. could do to stop Israel’s war in Gaza from spinning out of controlwere hardly made to appear substantively better, as Trump has repeatedly complained.\n\nBut Paramount, which is firstly and primarily an entertainment company, is seeking to merge with another corporation, Skydance, co-owned by longtime Trump pal Larry Ellison. It’s the reason why Shari Redstone — who, as the largest Paramount shareholder, will benefit handsomely from government approval of the merger — sought to simply pay Trump off rather than fight for a free press.And Trump’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made no bones about the fact that it was considering the lawsuit as part of its regulatory approval process for the planned $8.4 billion merger.\n\nTuesday’s announcement was hardly surprising. Earlier this year, major law firms did the same, rushing to cut deals with Trump after he lawlessly targeted them forretribution.Then, somecolleges and universitiesfollowed suit. Nowthe corporate media is fully capitulating, collectively forking over upwards of $65 million to Trump entities since the November election.\n\nThe following month, in the aftermath of Trump’s second shock election,ABC News, which is owned by Disney,set the precedentwhen it agreed to pay more than $15 million to Trump’s future library after anchor George Stephanopoulos reported that Trump was found liable for the “rape” of E. Jean Carroll. The next month, Facebook parent company Meta paid Trump $25 million to end a lawsuit over its decision to ban his accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot. In an earlier shift made to appease Trump, the social media giantalsoagreed to end fact-checking on its sites ahead of the 2024 election. In February, Elon Musk’s X reached a $10 million settlement with Trump for suspending his account following Jan. 6. And earlier this week, after dropping his federal lawsuit against famed pollster Ann Selzer and The Des Moines Register for publishing her pre-election Iowa poll that found him significantly trailing Kamala Harris, Trumprefiled the casein state court.\n\nTrump’s suit against Paramount sought to punish CBS News under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which is intended to protect customers from false advertising. In acourt filingfrom just last week, the company called out Trump’s “meritless lawsuit” as an attempt “to evade bedrock First Amendment principles establishing that public officials like themselves cannot hold news organizations like CBS liable for the exercise of editorial judgment.”\n\nOn Wednesday at the company’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Paramount CEO George Cheeksoffered a weak defenseof the payout. “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense,” he said.\n\nAs many have pointed out, this latest settlement will only embolden the president even further to continue his flurry of frivolous lawsuits against the press.Right-wing media, meanwhile, is using Paramount’s payment as proof of media malfeasance,suggestingthe company settled a winnable case because it sought to avoid potentially damaging discovery during a court trial. Major Trump boosterSean Hannity, citing Fox News Digital,misleadinglyreported that “the settlement could include an additional, mid-eight-figure sum earmarked for future ads and public service announcements aligned with conservative causes.” Notably, the settlement does not include CBS issuing an apology to Trump.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics?Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly showon YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nTrump isn’t an honest negotiator. Paramount is foolish if its executives think this secures a green light from the FCC of their sale. And what becomes of CBS News’ reputation, and that of their flagship news magazine program?\n\nThe turmoil inside both “60 Minutes” and the network’s larger news division has been intense. In April, during what the New York Timescharacterizedas an “emotional meeting,” longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned after he said he was pressured to alter the program’s coverage of the Trump administration. CBS News President Wendy McMahonresigned from the companythe following month amidst pressure from Trumpafter she alerted the public to the administration’s questionable actions.On Sunday, Oliver Darcy reported in hisStatus newsletterthat current “60 Minutes” correspondents signed a letter pleading with Paramount executives to “put up a fierce and unrelenting fight” against Trump’s lawsuit.\n\nReacting to the news on Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested the settlement “sounds like bribery in plain sight” andcalled for a congressional investiation, adding that she’s working to author legislation “to rein in this kind of corruption.” The Freedom of the Press Foundationindicatedthat it planned to file a shareholder’s lawsuit, because, ironically, it is shareholders who hold favorable grounds to sue in our corporatist system, not the people dependent on freedom of the press.\n\nWhat’s clear, in any case, is that big corporations undoubtedly threaten journalistic independence.\n\nAs it stands now, ABC News is owned by Disney, NBC News is owned by Universal and CNN is owned by Warner Bros. The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, while the Wall Street Journal and cable news giant Fox News are owned by Rupert Murdoch. Good luck bursting this billionaire bubble – let alone fending off another billionaire’s brazen attacks — with corporate-dominated media. Bezos, for example,infamously shelveda planned pre-election endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris by the Post’s editorial board last fall, and his space exploration company, BlueX, has spent millions lobbying for government contracts.\n\nThat’s how we got oversaturated coverage of Bezos’ $50 million celebrity-studded Venice wedding in a week when a Republican-led Congress rammed through one of the largest upwards redistributions of wealth in American history.When people fawn over billionaires, it feeds the frenzy as our freedoms get trampled.\n\nThe postToo corporate to fight for a free pressappeared first onSalon.com.",

    "News_text":"Archaeologists have unearthed in Egypt a long-lost Nile city containing homes, factories, and a ceremonial “causeway.”\n\nScientists working in the eastern Nile Delta discovered an entire city beneath a mound at Tell el-Fara'in (Mound of the Pharaohs). Known as Imet, the lost city contained multi-floor homes, ceremonial areas, granaries, and assorted religious artifacts, all of which remain immaculately preserved. The preservation is especially notable as artifacts made of mudbrick—like the structures in Imet—tend to degrade when stored underground. The excavation was undertaken by Nicky Nielsen, a senior lecturer in Egyptology at the University of Manchester, in collaboration with Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the University of Sadat City.\n\n\"Imet is emerging as a key site for rethinking the archaeology of Late Period Egypt,\" Nielsen said in a press release. \"These tower houses are most commonly encountered in the Nile Delta during the Late Period and the Roman period, and are otherwise rare in Egypt,\" he continued of the discovery. \"That they exist here indicates that Imet was a prosperous and densely constructed city with a sophisticated urban infrastructure.\"\n\nRelated: Metal Detectorist Finds Viking Hoard With Link to Norse God\n\nAfter identifying the site with satellite imaging, the researchers excavated a series of dense, multi-story homes as well as relatively advanced factories built to process grain. Also unearthed were animal enclosures, gesturing towards a rich and vibrant community. There was also a ceremonial “causeway,” something of a highway which connected Imet to a large center of worship just outside the city.\n\nFurther excavations are planned with the hope of discovering even more about the lost city’s mysterious past. \"Imet is becoming a critical location for reimagining the archaeology of Late Period Egypt,\" Nielsen concluded.\n\nLong-Lost Nile City Unearthed Beneath Egyptfirst appeared on Men's Journal on Jul 4, 2025",

    "News_title":"The stories behind history's most haunting shipwrecks",
    "News_text":"Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday to discuss his new book, \"The Great Museum of the Sea,\" and reflect on more than 50 years of searching forhistoric shipwrecks around the world.\n\nDelgado, who has investigated more than 100 shipwrecks globally, gained international attention in 2019 when he discovered the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States. The discovery was later featured in a\"60 Minutes\" segment with Anderson Cooper.\n\nThe archaeologist's fascination with shipwrecks began in childhood while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area, where he learned about ships from the 1849 Gold Rush. He said locating shipwrecks requires extensive preparation.\n\n\"It takes a team. And that team includes oceanographers, people that understand currents. We're also looking at old records and charts. You're also trying to understand the forensics of it,\" he said.\n\nThe process involves analyzing factors like ship speed and sailing patterns. Once located, the wrecks often don't match popular expectations.\n\n\"We have great images that people think of as shipwrecks, but there are a pile of rockets and timber and anchor, and then you go, all right, what exactly am I looking at here,\" he said.\n\nIn his book, Delgado describes the sea as \"the largest museum on Earth\" and argues that every shipwreck has a story to tell.\n\n\"I think the most important thing for people to remember about shipwrecks is that it's okay for them to have different meanings,\" Delgado said. \"Some people like them because they inspire you with the stories of bravery. Others are tragic and sad. For some, they're the graves of family. But for others, they're a great opportunity to dive and to explore.\"\n\nThe archaeologist has alsoexplored the Titanic,describing the experience as overwhelming despite the ship's fame.\n\n\"Nothing prepares you for seeing 'Titanic,'\" he said.\n\nAfter a 2.5-hour descent in a Russian submersible, with pressure so intense that \"a regular styrofoam coffee cup gets squeezed down\" when strapped to the outside, Delgado said the anticipation suddenly disappeared when the ship appeared.\n\n\"There it was looming out of the darkness,\" he recalled. \"This massive hull rising twice as high as the ceiling here. Still painted but streaked with rust and rusticles that are orange and yellow and red. And then a porthole that's open and another closed.\"\n\nDelgado described one particularly eerie moment: \"One of the spookiest moments — because 'Titanic' is a ship of the dead — is when I first looked through the porthole, 2.5 miles down, the lights — I could see a face looking back at me in the porthole. It was my own reflection.\"\n\nHe reflected on the ship's enduring power: \"This ship sitting on the bottom ruined and deteriorating still is the stage upon which some of the most powerful drama played out that we all know about with the shipwreck. And you're there.\"\n\n\"The Great Museum of the Sea\" is available wherever books are sold.\n\nWhat a new DOJ memo could mean for naturalized U.S. citizens\n\nJuly 4 holiday week expected to set record for travelers\n\nWWII veterans start new friendships during July 4th celebration",

    "News_title":"Transcript: Ken Burns on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" July 6, 2025",
    "News_text":"The following is the transcript of an interview with documentary filmmaker Ken Burns and \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 6, 2025.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So Ken, let's imagine it's July 3, 1776, what is happening in America?\n\nKEN BURNS: Well, this house is empty. What's happening in America is that in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress are debating this Declaration of Independence that a committee of five has drawn up. They've handed it off to Thomas Jefferson, one of the youngest, but who has a great felicity, someone said, with language to draft because you've got a pretty large geopolitical situation going on that people don't necessarily appreciate that we've got the French who are kind of interested in maybe helping us because they're so anti-British. But first of all, you have to say that you're a part and then you have to win a battle which is even harder to come by. And so we are here in this, you know, the early, early summer of 1776 debating, and the next day we'll sign this thing, and we will become the United States of America. Someone had suggested earlier in June in a newspaper anonymously signed Republicus, that we ought to have a real name, and suggested it should be the United States of America just, just a few weeks before it's, it's a pretty wonderful moment.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Was America United though in 1776 when they were about to make this big step?\n\nKEN BURNS: No, we'd been fighting for a year and a quarter. Lexington and Concord are as- is, is in April of '75 there- this is a civil war that's going on. More than likely you might be a loyalist. You've lived under the, you know, the British constitutional monarchy. You know, there's no better form of government on earth. Why would I risk anything for this, you know, upstart ideas that have zero chance of success? And what happens is that this document that Jefferson principally crafts is a document that is distilling a century of enlightenment thinking into one sentence, the second sentence of the Declaration, which is, you know, next to I love you, I can't think of a better sentence in the English language.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: America- you call the Revolutionary period a civil war.\n\nKEN BURNS: It is.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Was that always your conception of the–\n\nKEN BURNS: No.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: How did you come to think of it that way?\n\nKEN BURNS: I think because there are no photographs and there's no newsreels, and they're in, you know, stockings and breeches and powdered wigs. There's a sense of distance from them. I think we also are so proud, rightfully, of the power of the big ideas that we we just don't want to get into the fact that it was this bloody civil war, patriots against loyalists, disaffected people, Native people, enslaved and free people within it, foreign powers that are ultimately engaged in this. This is a big world war by the end. I think we perhaps, are fearful that those big ideas are diminished, and they're not, in any way. They're, in fact, become even more inspiring that they emerge from the turmoil. You could even look at our civil war and say, it's not really a civil war, not a lot of civilian deaths, and it's a sectional war, but the revolution, you definitely do not want to be in New Jersey or South Carolina, because people are in kind of open revolt. People, there are guerilla actions. There's little assassinations, taking things out on your neighbor who's a loyalist, when the Patriots are dominant, taking things out on your neighbor who's a patriot, when the British and the Loyalists are dominant in a particular area. It's really, really bad.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: How should we think about the Declaration of Independence, this period in America, in our present day?\n\nKEN BURNS: First of all, I think the American Revolution is the most important event since the birth of Christ in all of world history.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Why?\n\nKEN BURNS: I mean, it turned the world upside down, which is the cliche. Before this moment, everyone was a subject, essentially under the rule of somebody else. We had created, in this moment, a very brand new thing called a citizen and this has had powerful effects. It's going to set in motion revolutions for the next two plus centuries, all around the world, all attempting to sort of give a new expression to this idea that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that's a big, big deal in world history. So what happens here is, I suppose you could, you know, miss the point, and say it's a quarrel between Englishmen, but it is the beginning of something absolutely new in the world, and that is something to celebrate and to understand too, that it comes out of so much division that's going on between the states. People in New Hampshire and Georgia are, they're from different countries. They believe different things. That you could have the divisions of loyalists and patriots. You could have this, all the things that are roiling in these colonies, and understand that out of that, we could still figure out a way to come together.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Americans think they're pretty divided right now. They weren't nearly as divided as they were during the Revolutionary period.\n\nKEN BURNS: Here's the simple thing, we're always divided, so it ebbs and flows a little bit, but we're always have big differences. You know, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is not met with universal approval. The Civil War kills 750,000 Americans, we think, over the issue of slavery. We have our own revolution. There are lots of periods, the Vietnam period, when we're so particularly divided. So I think there's a little bit of chicken little, you know, oh, the sky is falling because it's now. Things are always worse now than they ever were. The only- the reason why historians, and God knows, I'm an amateur historian, feel a kind of optimism, is because there's something familiar. There's, you know, the Bible says there's nothing new under the sun, human nature essentially doesn't change, and that's true. What's great about the Revolution is, for a moment, things actually, there was something new in the world, and that's the thing that we need to use. That's the leverage we have to bring us back to the ability to speak to one another, to understand how you solve your differences, as opposed to the sort of soup of anger and distrust that seem to be, you know, everywhere now.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: John Dos Passos said that when men, in times of where men feel quick sand under their feet, history is a lifeline to the- from the past to the present. What lifeline do you see from the Revolutionary period, if we're always divided, what's the lifeline to the present from the Revolutionary period?\n\nKEN BURNS: That's a wonderful phrase. I think it's manifest in so many different ways. Obviously, we're the only country, we know exactly when we were born, and we're the country that's held together, not by language, not by religion, not by even geography, we're held together by words. And so I think, to me, it always comes back to words, and why being here, you begin to realize the incredible power and import of those words that we hold these truths to be self evident. And you know, John, there was nothing self evident about those words. As someone said in an earlier film we made about, about Benjamin Franklin, this is the lawyers dodge, right? It's like there's nothing self-evident about this. But if you say it's self-evident, we just like we, of course, all agree this is true, and then say something that is so new in the world that it is still inspiring. I mean, I would normally be home on July 4 reading to my children the Declaration of Independence, because it has so much import and so much meaning, even today. And I think it doesn't take as much effort as we think it does to reinvest in those things that we share in common.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What's, what are, what is a citizen's obligation now?\n\nKEN BURNS: A citizens obligation now is the same as it's ever been, and that's the most important thing. There's a wonderful phrase a little bit later from the famous words where Jefferson says, All experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, meaning we all kind of have gravitated to be under authoritarian rule. You know, the trains run on time, or we get at least this, but we're going to require of you to be a citizen something more. It's got to be active. The Pursuit of Happiness is is not the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects, but lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. That's what the founders said, to be virtuous, to live a virtuous life, to continually educate yourself, is what was required to sustain this republic and I think that's what we've gotten away from. Everything is sort of all individualized. We're all free agents. We don't realize that freedom, the thing that we tout, is not just what I want, but also that's intention with what we need. And I think what happens is that when we study these words, we can go back to the sense of newness and freshness that they represented and rededicate ourselves, and that means me for me, and you for you, to this idea that the pursuit of happiness is about lifelong learning. It's about becoming ever more educated, to the responsibility of citizenship and that's a huge, huge responsibility, not just to take your feed, not just to go with this flow, not just to get your information that sort of ratifies what you already thought, but to actually explore what my neighbor thinks.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Being an American, as Jefferson saw it, as the founders saw it, was a continuing obligation to engage with its history.\n\nKEN BURNS: That's exactly right, and this is really important. In order to form the government, they had to reach back through the Middle Ages, through the Dark Ages, back to antiquity, to bring up these ideas like virtue and temperance and moderation and all of the things that all of them were looking for. I mean, the amazing thing is, we're here at Thomas Jefferson's house, but we don't have a country without his words. But also we don't have a country without George Washington. And yet, we know about all of these men. They're deeply flawed in many important ways. And I think today, in our binary culture, you know, where everything's a one or a zero or it's a red state or a blue state, it's my or the highway, we've forgotten that it's possible to tolerate, as we do among with the people we love, their strengths and their weaknesses. So heroism is not perfection, right? The Greeks told us that heroism was a negotiation within someone, sometimes a war between somebody's great strengths and their great flaws, like Achilles had his heel and his hubris to go along with his great strengths. And so I think that if we can take a historical view that permits us to see a Jefferson and a Washington in these very complicated understanding of them, then it's possible to then breathe, to have some room to understand who we are now, who we were then, and where we might be, which is, of course, the most important thing, all the anxiety about this present moment is really not so much about the present moment, but about will we survive, where will we be and and you can go back to this moment and be completely inspirited by possibility.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Is it necessary to understand the flaws of the founders so that they become more real and therefore their lessons are more accessible?\n\nKEN BURNS: I think so. I think we know what a superficial story means; its half life is so insignificant when you put everything into sort of cartoon stuff, into the white hat and the black hat and what that means. Yes, when you understand, Keats said that Shakespeare possessed this thing called negative capability that you could hold in tension someone's strengths and someone's weaknesses for as long as you possibly could and then, even then, you didn't necessarily have to make a decision. So you can understand George Washington as flawed as rash. He rides out on the battlefield of making bad decisions as a general. And yet, without him, we do not have a country. You know, we're speaking English or we're speaking French or Spanish, whatever it is, but, but we're a different, we're a different place without his, the leadership that he exhibited, and of course, that leadership was exhibited most spectacularly when he resigned his military commission and then left the presidency because he was giving up power and setting in motion an American example, that it isn't the person, it's the law. It's the- it's the form of government and these sorts of things have held us in good stead for 249 years.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You've named so many instances in which, basically America was thought into being, in other words, a set of ideas, just words, just the stuff that was going on in a bunch of heads of people ended up shaping an entire nation, and as you're saying, a course of history.\n\nKEN BURNS: So it isn't just Jefferson's words, right? You've have before it, in January, this Englishman who comes ashore at Philadelphia, half dead. He's a failure in everything in life, and he writes this little, tiny pamphlet called Common Sense. His name is Thomas Paine, and he gives just spectacular, almost poetic voice to this impulse. Like heretofore, people are not sure they want to separate from Britain, not sure about independence. They certainly would like to believe it's really not the king's fault, it's really Parliament's fault. And all of a sudden, he reminds people what monarchical and authoritarian rule is all about, and that you know, this idea that you could install yourself by virtue of your family for generation after generation isn't right, and so lots of words earlier, Sam Adams is keeping everybody alive to their grievances, he said, that's his job, right? He's, he's a failure as a brewer and as a tax collector, but boy, he's really good at keeping people upset at what the British are doing, or maybe not even doing, but may do, right? And so words are hugely important, and we are the sum total of the words we've talked about, rather than just, necessarily always the actions or the money or the place or the position or the celebrity. It's, it's, you know, Washington is interesting in that he's also a great judger of character. He knows how to pick subordinate talent like you can't believe, like you can't believe. I mean, even this committee that essentially (INAUDIBLE)by his age, that- that Benjamin Franklin is the sort of the senior of all seniors. But Adam says, you know, to Jefferson, you write it because, like, I'm short and fat and ugly and people don't like me. I'm obnoxious, but you have this great felicity of, with words.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: We're here in Jefferson's house. What if Tom walked in? What would you want to ask him?\n\nKEN BURNS: Oh, my goodness, a lot of them are deeply personal questions about his own life and what he couldn't deal with. He knew, as everyone knew, that slavery was immoral. It's only later generations that are going to try to justify it as the abolition movement grows in the 19th century, we're going to have to make Black people inferior in all of this. But there is a- there's a sense that, you know- he- Jefferson himself said slavery was like holding a wolf by the ears. You didn't like it, but you didn't dare let go. I'd want to ask him, deeply question, why don't you let it go? Your neighbor freed his slaves, your cousin freed his slaves. They both urged you to do the same thing, and you couldn't do that. You temporized. You bought more statuary and more wine from Europe and- and what was that about? Because, of course, you could articulate these universal, self evident truths, and yet couldn't live that out in his own lifetime.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Can you talk about the genius and brilliance of his words without sitting right in the middle of Jefferson's owning of slaves, enslaved people? You- can you talk about the two- I mean, can you talk about Jefferson's words without talking about--\n\nKEN BURNS: No, I think this is the important thing. And- and somehow we've- we've gotten to the idea that you just don't want to mess with the good stuff. And let's just pretend- pay no attention to that man behind- like you can't do that. A good story is a good story is a good story. And this is a really good part of the story. It's complicated, it's dark. There are human beings in this house who are owned by a person who has articulated universal rights for everyone. And what's so great is that the vagueness of the words has allowed everybody to plow through and make it their own, not just here, but all around the stuff so- so when he says pursuit of happiness, that may be the key word. When we say a more perfect union in the Constitution later on, that may be the key word that this is process that we're engaged in. And so maybe the- the poetry, but also the vagueness of the words, have opened a door that have allowed women to come through, that have allowed enslaved people to have citizenship, that have expanded in so many different ways and all around the world, that that's- this is progress. This is, you know, this is- and also the course of human events, right? Where you don't flick the switch, and it's all perfect, all at once. And so I think going back and understanding them for the deep undertow that's present and sometimes really discomforting undertow about it is okay. Nothing is diminished. Nothing is diminished. In fact, I think it's made more familiar. You know what? When it is- when you're in a conversation with a friend and the friend says, you know, I should have said this before, but I really hate this. Or, you know what, I did this, there's something suddenly, there's dimension now to the possibilities of the connection, one to the other. And I think when we look back and don't try to sanitize it. Don't make a Madison Avenue version of- of- of our past, but celebrate the grittiness, and I think, in this case, the violence of the American Revolution, we do a service to those ideas that we think need to be protected. I mean- what- this is not ideas that are fixed in amber. You know, this is, this is- this is gritty, gritty stuff. People died. Lots of people died fighting for this in just horrific struggles when the main form of killing was a bayonet. That's not fun.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: More authentic, more true, and therefore more real and accessible.\n\nKEN BURNS: Yeah. And then I think more powerful. That's- what we're looking for is meaning. At the end of the day, it's all about meaning. And so the stories that we tell, the truer, the more complicated they get, actually, the meaning increases. It's not decreased. It's only an authoritarian that wishes to, you know, in the old Soviet thing, where all of a sudden that photograph no longer has so and so in it, he's no longer there watching the May Day parade. They've cut him out because he's out of favor. We don't need to do that in this country. We can actually be big enough to accept these contradictions within our founding and within ourselves. Jefferson is certainly the embodiment of deep and- and very complicated, you know, differences, internal psychology.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: President Trump has issued an executive action in which he says basically, history has gotten out of balance. Says that the American government either funds it through museums or national parks, and he said instead that this federal role in history should instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and the progress of the American people. So President Trump thinks there's an imbalance in the way we talk about history. How do you see that?\n\nKEN BURNS: I don't see the imbalance. I think we need to celebrate the greatness of the American people. The greatness of the American people comes from telling these complicated stories, and that's a good story. A good story is a good story. That's what you're looking for. You don't want to just say it otherwise, it's just sort of slogans that are- that are put up on the wall. We want to feel that we know who Thomas Jefferson is. We need to understand the internal struggles that Abraham Lincoln had. We have to understand what was going through Rosa Parks' mind when she, you know, refused to give up her seat on the bus. This, in no way takes away from the glory, it just makes the story fuller and richer and and permits purchase for everyone you want a history to be complicated because it gives everybody a chance to own or have access to it. There is my door where I'm going through. There's a wonderful scholar, Maggie Blackhawk in our film, who says, after our scene on the Declaration of Independence, that it's deeply significant to people at the margins. That these words that do not include them. They do not include women, they do not include the poor, they do not include any enslaved or free African Americans. They do not include Native Americans. But the words themselves are so inspirational that they begin to suggest a much larger and more, what we would say, kind of American polity. That a bunch of us all together, of different varieties, doing lots of different things and pursuing happiness, this- this idea of virtue and lifelong learning.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Along those lines, that- the stories you tell in this documentary and the people who tell it are-  there's a real diversity. Was that an important part of your storytelling?\n\nKEN BURNS: Absolutely, I think that, you know, we tend to have the Revolution, we think of it as just the guys in Philadelphia, which is really important, thinking great thoughts and writing them down. The boldface names, if you will. What we wanted to do is take those boldface names and make them not just kind of inaccessible, but real. So you could understand dimension to them. But then also realize they're scores of other people that have voices and that are important, and they, you know, they're .01% of people had their portraits painted. That doesn't mean that everybody else didn't exist, or everybody else didn't do something, particularly if you gave your life on Bunkers Hill to start this new nation, or- or- or- at Yorktown, or at Brandywine or Long Island. You know, just because you don't have a portrait painted, it doesn't mean that you're not somebody. So we're trying to give everyone a voice, and so that what you have is a chorus. So it all goes back to music. Always goes back to music that, you know, Lincoln talks about, the mystic chords of memory. These are not ropes. These are celestial chords that- that the chorus of Americans has an emotional power to it, that the singularity of just making it about a great man theory. You- the problem has been in that, at times- and may have to do with Trump's initiatives, is that we've- in order to tell a bottom up story, we sometimes thrown out a top down story. There's no need. You can do a top down and a bottom up. And that's actually the most vigorous and active and most powerful form of history is when they meet. When- as you are in a tent a few 100 yards from Rochambeau's tent outside Yorktown, you being George Washington, that you also know that that group that's taking Redoubt Number 10 has, led by Lafayette, includes Alexander Hamilton, but also has Joseph Plumb Martin, who signed up a couple days after the declaration at age 15, and has just seen unbelievable action and violence and whatever, is rushing the abattis, the spiked logs that are going to protect them, along with Rhode Islanders who have been promised their freedom after the war is over, both runaway and enslaved Rhode Island- I mean, this is who takes Redoubt Number 10 that permits us, along with Redoubt Number 9 that the French take to roll the big guns in to make Cornwallis painfully aware, if he has not been aware of it at to the- up to that point that his cause is lost, and will precipitate the surrender that will come a few days later.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Diversity of voice and storytelling was important to you, that also is under assault at the moment. The president basically is trying to remove all efforts to keep diversity in mind. Is there something that is lost in that?\n\nKEN BURNS: Well, you know, there's a strength in a wagon wheel of all the different spokes into the hub. We're all looking for the hub, whatever the hub is. Meaning, you know, something that pulls us together, that chorus, that's what we're all about. And so that the strength of that wheel has to do with having the spokes and having a multitude of perspectives. The impulse for some is to say there's only one perspective, and that's true of many different things, and it isn't just from a top down, sort of a sense, so let's make this simpler. It's also- a lot of people mistake, and what we've tried to do is be liberated from any fashion of what's called historiography. Sorry, to you know, on a Sunday morning, make the words so big, but it's sort of the fashions of the way we study history. Sometimes say it's got to be only from this perspective. It's got to be Freudian, or it's got to be Marxist economic, or it's got to be symbolic, or it's got to be, you know, post-modern or whatever. The thing is, you don't need that. You- all you need to do is say, if a kid was involved, I want to understand what that kid felt. If a great, you know, person that George Washington, I want to know what he- what he did and what he felt. Did he really need to ride out into the battle at Kips Bay and risk his own life. I mean, at one time at Princeton, he does the same thing, and his own aides are covering their eyes, afraid they're going to see their commander in chief- if he's shot it's all over. There's no country, right? And then watch him make mistakes, and at the same time, see the way he held like the strongest of glues the country together as it's going.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You say history is the best teacher we have. What did working on this documentary about the Revolution teach you?\n\nKEN BURNS: You know, here's- here's the- the lead that has been buried. This is the most important experiment in human government that the world has seen. And we- we bury that light under a bushel all the time, either through our internal doubts, either through our struggles with one another, through this kind of binary sense of, you know, I'm wrong. You're- you know, you're right. I'm right, you're wrong. Whatever it might be, we- we've- we've missed the most important thing that the creation of the United States of America was one of the great things that have ever taken place in human history, and that's something to celebrate.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: So in looking in the past, you discovered something that should be and is, and you're seeing very much alive today.\n\nKEN BURNS: This is what makes history the best teacher, because it permits you to understand that there- it wasn't always some beautiful, great time beforehand. It's always been complicated. There's always been enormous divisions, and we always have had an ability by using the force of the system we created. I mean, these guys at the Constitutional Convention, they are worrying constantly about, you know- how to- well, what if this happens? Well, what if that happened? How do we protect about this? How do we protect about that? And they're all trying to, I mean, with the exception of the Preamble, the Constitution is extraordinarily just boilerplate language. It's an operating system, right? But it's so good, and the fact that it's immediately amended, it wouldn't have even been able to go into effective use without the Bill of Rights that were sort of essentially codifying what everybody thought they had been fighting for over the last many, many, many years. And remember, this is a battle that's been, you know, with the British the struggle has been going on from well before Lexington and Concord, with the Boston Massacre or the Tea Party or other, you know, acts of collective disobedience. But in April 19, 1775, it begins. And it's not over until 71 when the surrender happens in the fall, so six and a half years. But it's not going to be till the last British troop leaves, another two years, and the Treaty of Paris is formalized. I see you're talking about a huge period of time that we're engaged in a revolution, and there's lots of stuff going on.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Why did you originally want to make this?\n\nKEN BURNS: I thought it was impossible to do. When we were finishing our film on the Vietnam War in 2015- we began this when Barack Obama had, you know, 13 months left in his pres- presidency. People often say, why the Revolution and why now? I said, this is a really long now. I- having done the Civil War and World War Two and Vietnam, I realized the last big remaining thing was to sort of peel away the layers of sentimentality and nostalgia that has smothered the revolution and to try to get at that. And I didn't think, because there are no photographs and newsreels, that we would be able to do that, but I remember seeing a map of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, a kind of animated, almost 3-D map that we had made. And I went, wait this- this could easily be just following the British West in Long Island towards Brooklyn. And if you- we can do this, then we have a way- we can treat the paintings like they're photographs. We can take live cinematography and treat them like they're paintings. We can collect reenacting footage, not to replace, you know, telling this our traditional way of telling a battle, but as grist for the mill of how we could make it come alive. And all of those things, graphics and maps and live cinematography and paintings and drawings, all of them, I suddenly had this thing. I remember just turning to Sarah Botstein and saying, we're doing the revolution next. Now, next meant 10 years, or almost 10 years.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What layer of sentimentality about the revolution to you is most dangerous to the true history or to the complexity of histories?\n\nKEN BURNS: I think the most dangerous thing is to not understand how incredibly violent it was and how many different parties were involved. We'd like to believe that our revolution is our own wonderful thing that we did, but we can't do it without the French. This is a global war at the end, in which not only the- France is on our side, but so is Spain and the Netherlands, but they have ulterior motives. They really just want to see the British, who have the largest and most far flung empire, diminish. So you've got all these wonderful competing things that people go, \"it's too complicated.\" It's not too complicated. Everybody gets it. If you can watch Shogun and figure it out, if you can watch The Bear, if you can watch Succession, you know, it's all- we know how to handle complicated stories. And I kind of resent the idea that we're told that we can't. That for the most important stories that Americans could ever have, that is the story of us, not just the upper case U.S., but of us intimately, that somehow we have to dumb it down. Sometimes- somehow we have to sort of sanitize it. Somehow we have to make it free of the \"yes, buts.\" All of life is a \"yes, but.\"\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What about attention? Do you also- What about attention? The idea that people just don't have the time for all this?\n\nKEN BURNS: When I made the Civil War series, people said, oh, this is really good, but no one's going to watch it because there are these things called MTV videos, and they're like, two minutes, and they've eroded the attention span. People have always had their attention drawn to little, tiny, frivolous things. Always, forever. And they've also been able to realize that the greatest meaning accrues in duration, that the work you're proudest of, the relationships you care the most about, have benefited from your same attention- sustained attention. So what do we do now in this tsunami of content? We binge. What? You mean, you look at something for days on end, the whole thing over and over? We- the attention is there. It is true that there are lots of distractions to that attention. But the way we self, you know, medicate from the sheer amount of stuff there is, is by saying, I'm going to choose to watch this for a really long time. I see that in my kids who do TikTok stuff, but they'll sit there and watch four seasons of whatever it is in one sitting. So I'm not worried that there's not an audience anymore out there for 12 hours on- on sort of the Rosetta Stone, of what- of where we came from, what our birth was about.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Going back to this idea of ongoing nourishment of history, part of- go back to the revolution to learn who we are, now. Do you ever think of this work as an intervention in- we've gotten- people don't- people don't reread the Declaration every fourth of July, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. People, in your telling, seem to have lost sight of some of the parts of our founding. Maybe we don't even know them because we've been told different kinds of stories. Is this an intervention?\n\nKEN BURNS: No. Intervention imposes between the storyteller, that would be us, and the story we're trying to tell and our audience some sort of larger highfalutin purpose. A good story is a good story is a good story, and that's all we're interested in doing. I do still read the Declaration of Independence to my children now, grandchildren every single Fourth of July. I think there are lots of Americans who do that. Certainly, there are lots of people who go, great a day off and hot dogs and hamburgers, what could be better? And tell me, what could be better than that? It's okay. Everybody likes the fireworks display. There's- there's still it's- once again, it's back to this idea of chorus. The Fourth of July is my favorite holiday, because you sit there on a blanket on a field looking at these fireworks with all these other people in the dark, and you share with them in common that we agree to, basically, a sentence in a document written, you know, by a Virginian who lived here, you know, 249 years ago. That's really powerful stuff. And then John Adams, he said it, you know, this is so great, we should be celebrating this every year with bonfires and fireworks and demonstrations. And we do. We followed exactly what they told us to do. So, the fact that it can be misinterpreted by some, this is always going to be the case. Manipulated by others, this will always be the case. Sort of, you know, genuinely embraced, but for the wrong reasons, this will always be the case. But we still- we know, we understand that we hold these truths to be self-evident, even though they weren't, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Doesn't get any better than that.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: What is your- How do you receive the polling that shows people are having different views of what it means to be patriotic, and maybe even being patriotic at all is something, maybe, somebody doesn't want to be.\n\nKEN BURNS: Well, I think- I notice that, particularly among a younger generation, that they have lost a kind of connection with the glories of the American experiment because of what they've seen. You know, if you're seven or eight years old and you see George Floyd murdered, you've got a different sense of how much we've delivered on these original promises or not. I think this is- these are ebbing and flowing figures that we can't spend too much of our time being caught up with. We have to spend more of our time working towards it, the pursuit of happiness. It may involve somebody or groups of somebodies telling our stories. It may be, for somebody else, it might be helping out at a food kitchen. It may be somebody else going to school and in their form of scholarship, in science or in the humanities, have figured out something new that we need. Maybe it's in business, where you've discovered some product. Or maybe it's in public service, which is an essential part of all of this. And that public service is not necessarily the president. George Washington understood that the best office was citizen. That's why he resigned. So maybe you begin and it's your school board, maybe it's you know, you're doing something local. But I think that we're- the polling sometimes reflects just a particular anxiety, and these are shifting all the time, all the time. And it- and I can tell you, just in the time it's taken us to work on this film, how much things have- have changed and gone back and changed again. And it doesn't matter, Democrat, Republican, red state, blue state. These are superficial, binary considerations. The more important thing is that is the- that's the tip of the iceberg, right? It's the- it's the massiveness of what's underneath it. And I think a lot of people still share it, and all you need is a story or an anthem or a chorus to sort of provide the opportunities to reconfigure. That's what it is.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: You've told a lot of- You've told a lot of your stories on PBS. PBS is under threat.\n\nKEN BURNS: All of them, all of them.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Are you worried about the future of PBS?\n\nKEN BURNS: Of course, I am, and I've always been worried about it. In the 1990s I think I testified in the House or the Senate in Appropriations or Authorization about the endowments or about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting a half dozen times.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Make the case for PBS.\n\nKEN BURNS: It is the Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world. It's a bottom up. It's the largest network in the country. There's 330 stations. It mostly serves –  and this is where the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is so short sighted – it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get. They also have not only our good children's and prime time stuff, they have classroom on the air continuing education, homeland security, crop reports, weather emergency information. That we're going to take away? This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left wing thing, when this is the place that, for 32 years, gave William F. Buckley a show, right? I mean, it's- and it's- that show is, by the way, is still going on and moderated by a conservative. So I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water. And I couldn't do- let me personalize it, and I didn't want to. John, I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS. I could go into a streaming service or a premium cable tomorrow and get every one of the millions of dollars it took to do this in one pitch, but they wouldn't give me 10 years. They want it in a year or a year and a half, and that's the deal. I can't do that. Same with Vietnam, same with the Civil War, same with Jazz, same with the National Parks, same with, you know, the Roosevelts, all of those- Country Music, all of those have taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape. These are really good American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about. That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: As someone who worked so hard on telling the story of slavery and enslaved people in various different ways, what did you learn about slavery in America from working on this?\n\nKEN BURNS: It's so complicated and so interesting. I- I think the thing that was most striking that's come to me is that it was really clear that our founders, even those founders who owned other human beings, knew that the institution of slavery was indefensible. It's only later in the 19th century that you'll sort of make- you'll try to make excuses for why it's okay and that they're really wrestling with ways, but there are human beings that are owned by other human beings. There are slaves from New Hampshire to- to Georgia. And one person, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed, says it's important to understand that the South is a slave society and the North is a society with slaves, and there's a big difference. So even within the United States, I was learning constantly. Maybe 20,000 Black people fought in the Revolution, probably 15 for the British who had cynically offered them their freedom. Not freedom of loyalists, right? And how you're going to tell I don't know, but- but they are- and then 5,000 fought valiantly for the Patriot cause. It's very, very complicated, and you can never say a categorical them about anybody, and that's all we do. Look, I have- I have made films about the U.S. for all of my professional life, but I've also made films simultaneously about us, all of the intimacy of that, all the majesty and complexity and contradiction and controversy of the U.S. And the thing I've learned, if I've learned anything, is that there's only us, there's no them, and we're constantly being told: there's a them. There's no them and that's what this document produced by the man who- who sat in this room, you know, and looked at, you know, heard his troubled secretary Meriwether Lewis, say, you know what, 15 million got you? It got you this. And, by the way, there's no Northwest Passage, but look what you have here. And you've got, you know, the Lewis and- this is- this is- this is where you know he- he- he learns the whole thing.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: If there is only us and no them, it is also a strain in American history: look at them, go get them.\n\nKEN BURNS: That's right. It's the simplest thing. It's the authoritarians' playbook. That's what you always do. You make- if you make an enemy and you say, you know, your problem is that there's that thing happening, but there's really not that. All of the religious traditions remind us that, or try to remind us that, and- and we want to forget it. There's something simplistic about allowing ourselves to be convinced that there is a them, you know, we- we've- we've- we've, in our own political documents, have enshrined the sanctity of the individual. The religious doctrines have been doing that for centuries. And so the idea of making distinctions, you know, I remember I gave a speech at Brandeis, a commencement speech, talking about the Middle East, and I said, these three great religions, all with claim to the same holy ground, have turned it into a shameful graveyard. God does not distinguish between the dead.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: There's a lot of talk about them these days. Are you hoping to pierce that with this telling of America's beginning?\n\nKEN BURNS: I don't have a conscious desire to do this. There's- there's a kind of- that implies a kind of agenda, kind of a political agenda. I know that a good story is a benign Trojan horse. You take it in and it- it- it- at night, it goes into the city, and it doesn't slay anybody. It just reminds them: no them, no them, no them. This is- isn't this wonderful? Isn't this- isn't this important? Isn't this extraordinary? Isn't the complication worth learning about? And that- that's the only thing- that's- if- we have been- we have been really disciplined to say we just want to tell a story. I mean, Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. We consciously understand, as we're working on a film, how many- how much it's rhyming in the present and it changes a little bit, and changes that. But we don't ever try to put neon signs going, look how much this is so much like today. We just want to let that resonate. And you go, oh my goodness, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they may have wigs and they may have breeches, they're very much like us.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Because if you put too much of a thumb on the scale, you ruin the story, and then you kill the power of the story.\n\nKEN BURNS: That's exactly right. You have to let it tell the story. Our job is to be a good storyteller. Period, full stop, end of sentence.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Which means telling a story well enough that somebody might take a conclusion that's totally different than--\n\nKEN BURNS: Oh, absolutely you- you know, I remember watching this and going, oh my god, there's- there's actually places for all different kinds of people to find purchase. You know, this is a big- a good story is a big house with lots of different doors, and we tend to go through the front door and think that's it. Somebody may be coming in the side door. Somebody may be coming- climbing up and- and breaking in from the second- however you get in, you're in, and that's all you want, is, you know, stories are invitations like, honey, how was your day, right? It doesn't begin: I backed slowly down the driveway, avoiding the garbage can at the curb, you- you just edit human experience. And that's what we spent the last 10 years doing. We're saying this story of the American founding, our- our creation myth, is as important a story to get right as anything, and we've spent 10 years trying to get it right.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: In Ken Burns' history, there are many mansions. Last question--\n\n(CLOCK CHIMES)\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Oh, yay. Oh, my God, it's Thomas Jefferson saying, \"Wrap it up.\"\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Okay, here's the- here's the question, what is the difference between the Revolutionary War and the American Revolution?\n\nKEN BURNS: Benjamin Rush, who is the great physician of the time, one of the signers of the Declaration, said that- when it was over, that the- the American war is over, but the American Revolution is going on. I think if you accept the idea of pursuit of happiness, if you accept the idea of a more perfect union, you realize, as we do in our own lives, in our own work, in our own relationships, that it's about process, that we're engaged in an ongoing desire to achieve these things. This perfection is what you want to tilt for. It's unattainable, obviously, but if you're not engaged in the active pursuit of perfection, self, relationship, community, country, world, then you're stopped, you're static, and you're not going forward. And I think there's not an American that does not want to go forward.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: We're here in Jefferson's house. The only thing he was perhaps more proud of than Monticello was the University of Virginia. It's on his tombstone. The president of the University of Virginia just resigned under pressure from the president. What would Jefferson think?\n\nKEN BURNS: Well, you know, it's the first university that was founded in the United States without a religious affiliation. It was really important to him that part of this thing that we not make the mistake of the other countries of having a set and recognized religion. And I think that he would be shocked at any kind of interference with the- with the goings on of a laboratory of- of experimentation, a laboratory of education and discovery.\n\nJOHN DICKERSON: Can we learn about history if the government is telling us what we can and can't do as we try to arrange our- our system for learning?\n\nKEN BURNS: Yeah, you sure can. Stories are kind of subversive in that way. They just tell you stuff, the, sort of, the inconvenient truths of- of stuff that's going on and good stories are- are very much that, I think, and that's what we hope always. I'm not sure that we succeed everywhere, but telling a good story has a kind of way of- of setting aside the mythologies or the certainties, right? There- there's really, you know, the enemy of good anything is certainty. It's always my way or the highway. That just doesn't work. And so stories, good stories, I think, are- are wonderfully- they have a wink to them. And you know, it's just like humor, it hits both the yes and no at the same time. A good story is always going to be collecting the- the complication, the tensions within and between individuals, and when they're represented, then people grow. You're stunted, and you're back to being a subject, you're back to being a superficial peasant, superstitious peasant, if you're- if- if- if you're subscribing to one set of things, you know. It just reminds me of those Soviets editing the photograph, right? Saying, oh, that person doesn't exist anymore. We- we've torn him out. He- he- he doesn't exist. He goes out of our history books. There- it's all there. We- and- and our liberation, you know, Harry Truman is supposed to have said, the only thing that's really new is the history you don't know. I love the idea.

    "News_title":"Trump's signing of 'One Big Beautiful Bill' includes $85 million to move space shuttle Discovery from Smithsonian to Texas",
    "News_text":"When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nOn July 4, 2006, NASA's space shuttle Discovery launched on a \"return to flight\" mission that paved the way for it and its sister ships to fly for another five years. Now, a sprawling budget enacted on Independence Day will seemingly lead to Discovery lifting off again — though this time not into space, but rather from its place in the national collection.\n\nPresident Donald Trumpsigned into law the so-called \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" today (July 4), a day after the legislation was narrowly passed out of Congress with only Republican support. Deep within the 900-page bill is aprovision added by Texas' senatorsto transfer a \"space vehicle\" to a NASA center \"involved in the administration of the Commercial Crew Program\" and \"placed on public exhibition at an entity within the Metropolitan Statistical Area where such center is located.\"\n\nThe vague language, written in such a way to skirt Senate restrictions on reconciliation bills, was aimed at achieving the \"Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act\" introduced by Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn in April.\n\n\"It's long overdue for Space City to receive the recognition it deserves by bringing thespace shuttle Discoveryhome,\" said Cornynin a statementreleased after the Senate passed its version of the bill in a vote of 50 to 50, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie.\n\n\"Houston has long stood at the heart of America's human spaceflight program, and this legislation rightly honors that legacy,\" said Cruz, who chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation. \"It ensures that any future transfer of a flown, crewed space vehicle will prioritize locations that have played a direct and vital role in our nation's manned space program, making Houston, Texas, a leading candidate.\"\n\n\"Bringing such a historic space vehicle to the region would underscore the city's indispensable contributions to our space missions, highlight the strength of America's commercial space partnerships, and inspire future generations of engineers, scientists, and pioneers who will carry our legacy of American leadership in space,\" he said.\n\nThe bill allocates $85 million to move Discovery from the its display home of the past 13 years, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, to Space Center Houston, the official visitor center for NASA'sJohnson Space Centerin Texas. \"No less than $5 million\" is earmarked for the transportation of the winged orbiter, with the remainder going towards the \"construction of a facility to house the space vehicle.\"\n\nPer the bill, the move ofspace shuttleDiscovery must be completed by Jan. 4, 2027. It does not stipulate how the orbiter should be moved. It is not clear if the $85 million will be enough to cover the transfer and display, given that the first time the retired shuttles werebrought to their museum homesin 2012, the cost for just the preparation and delivery of each vehicle was $28.8 million, which did not include ground transportation to the museum.\n\nDiscovery is the United States' most flown spacecraft in history, with 39 missions between 1984 and 2011. In the process of retiring the shuttle fleet, Discovery was identified by NASA as the \"vehicle of record,\" such that it was kept more intact thanAtlantisorEndeavourfor the purpose of serving as engineering example at the Smithsonian.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n—Texas senators: Move space shuttle Discovery from Smithsonian to Houston\n\n—NASA's space shuttle: The first reusable spacecraft\n\n—Discovery: NASA's busiest shuttle\n\nSpace Center Houston has not released any details as of yet about how or where it will display Discovery, other than to say it fits into its strategic plans moving forward. The center already exhibits amock, walkthrough space shuttle, \"Independence,\"mounted atop NASA''s original modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, \"NASA 905.\"\n\nA2011 investigationby the NASA Office of the Inspector General found \"no evidence that the White House, politics or any other outside force improperly influenced the selection decision\" of where the space shuttles were originally awarded by the space agency. It is unclear if there are any further actions the Smithsonian or other entities could take to halt Discovery's transfer.",

    "News_text":"Popular Science and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\n\nWhenFrederick Grant Bantingdiscovered how to isolate insulin from animals in 1921, the young Canadian doctor—a WWI veteran and former farm boy—changed the calculus of diabetes forever. Prior to the 1920s, the disease killedmore than 80 percent of preteen diabetic children. Banting’s breakthrough replaced thesometimes toxicremedygoat’s rue, orGalega officinalis, a flowering plant with glucose-lowering properties derived from guanidine. His discovery came during a wave of medical optimism fueled by new scientific tools and knowledge that were rapidly unlocking the mysteries of human anatomy, disease, and aging.\n\nThe foundations for this optimism had been building for decades. Germs were firstdiscovered in the 1880s, ushering in the golden age of bacteriology and numerous life-saving vaccines. Vitamins got their name in the early 1900s when London-based Polish biochemistCasimir Funk—one of many scientists seeking cures for common diseases by linking them to vital nutrient deficiencies—combined “vital” and “amines.” Rickets led to the discovery of vitamin D, scurvy to vitamin C, andvitamin Bwas tied toberiberi, a disease that causes weakness, weight loss, confusion, and, in extreme cases, death. Meanwhile, anesthesia transformed surgery from a grisly performing art with low survival rates to more precise procedures conducted in germ-free operating rooms. Bit by bit, medicine appeared to be conquering many of humanity’s most pernicious plagues and thereby extending our average lifespan.\n\nByJuly 1925,Popular Sciencewriter John E. Lodge even suggested that humans might soon be able to extend their life expectancy to 1,000 years. “Thanks to the efforts of science in combatting the ravages of disease, the average span of life is increasing every year,” Lodge wrote. “Are we to expect, then, that in time science will succeed in prolonging the average life until, like Methuselah, we measure our lives by centuries instead of by years.” Lodge envisioned a world where aging could be halted by replacing worn-out enzymes, transplanting organs, or manipulating an elusive “vital spark.” Scientists, he claimed, might be on the verge of conquering death itself.\n\nA hundred years later, we’re still not there, but we continue to chase immortality with the same zest. Just as a century ago, today that quest is fueled not by glamorous breakthroughs—even if history makes it seem so—but by painstaking, collaborative scientific research, yielding fresh medical insights. In place of insulin, vaccines, and vitamins, today we’re captivated by gene-editing, cellular reprogramming, and immunotherapy. Frombiohackers injecting stem cellsin search of cellular youth to billionaires likeBryan Johnsonleaning onwearable tech for preventative health,blood plasma exchanges, andcaloric restriction, the goal of outsmarting death hasn’t diminished—the elixirs are just more sophisticated.\n\nAnd yet, we’ve come a long way in a century. In 1925, the average American lifespan was 58 years; today, it’s 78.4 years,according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Such progress might seem meager compared to our grandiose early 20th century expectations, but the trend suggests that by the next century the average American would live to be a centenarian. There’s even reason to believe—as there was in 1925—that current promising research might yield treatments as soon as the next few decades that significantly extend our lifespans while improving disease resistance.\n\nConsider howresearchers in Singaporehave extended the lives of mice 25 percent by blocking the protein interleukin-11.Scientists at the University of Rochesterhave successfully transferred a longevity gene to mice from naked mole rats, which live ten times longer than similar rodents. The gene, known for producing high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, or HMW-HA, extended mouse lives by 4.4% and improved their overall health. The researchers now aim to transfer these benefits to humans.\n\nIn an ironic twist, a century after Banting’s insulin discovery displaced goat’s rue, a derivative of the pink-and-white flowering plant is back in favor. Metformin, abiguanidemedication, has become one ofthe leading drugs for managing type 2 diabetes. Like itsmedievalpredecessor, which was used for everything from increasing milk flow in livestock to alleviating plague symptoms, metformin has been similarly used or tested in myriad applications: as anantimalarial drug,influenza treatment,lactation enhancer,arthritis remedy, and cardiovascular medicine. Now, scientists have begun to piece together the mystery of metformin’s versatility by mapping how it works at a cellular level.Recent researchhas shown that it may slow or inhibit cellular changes leading to inflammation and age-related diseases, extending lifespan.\n\nThe cellular aging story stretches back to the late 19th century. As scientists were discovering germs, developing vaccines, uncovering the link between vital nutrients and common diseases, and improving surgery, evolutionary biologistAugust Weismanntheorizedthat human cells had replication limits, which explained why the ability to heal diminished with age. By the 1960s, scientists had proven Weismann correct. Today, researchers are learning to halt and reverse cellular aging throughreprogramming, an idea first attemptedin the 1980sand advanced byNobel Prize recipient Shinya Yamanaka, who discovered how to revert mature, specialized cells back to their embryonic, or pluripotent state, enabling them to regenerate into new tissue like liver cells or teeth.\n\n100 years ago, the battle for television raged\n\nA century ago, suspended monorails were serious mass-transit contenders\n\nWhy we can’t squash the common cold, even after 100 years of studying it\n\n100 years of deep-sea filmmaking and ocean exploration\n\nBut none of this means we’re approachingthousand-year lifespans. Most longevity interventions work only in tightly controlled laboratory settings or short-lived animals. Translating them into humans presents entirely different—and enormously complex—challenges. Even if we managed to double or triple the human lifespan, equally complex social challenges would follow: Who would get access to life-extending therapies? How do we support a society where most people live into their third or fourth century? What psychological toll does such extreme longevity take?\n\nThe optimism of 1925 wasn’t misplaced; it was simply premature. It still might be, but today’s longevity researchers are armed with more sophisticated tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes. Whether today’s tools and knowledge will finally enable us to defy death remains to be seen. If there’s a lesson to draw from the past hundred years, however, it’s that life extension is incremental, fragile, and often humbling. We’ve added decades to average life expectancy, transformed once-fatal diseases into manageable conditions, and dramatically improved the quality of life in later years. That’s no small feat—but it’s not immortality.",

Between the centralized growth area, grazing by livestock, and being run over by off-road vehicles, the plant has had a challenging time thriving.\n\nAs for why the amole has suddenly reappeared, scientists theorize that weather conditions may have strengthened underground amole bulbs. Drought-like conditions from previous years may have harmed plants competing with the amole for space and resources, while subsequent years saw higher amounts of rainfall, which could have reached the bulbs.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that the plant was around the whole time, and no one came across it.\n\nThe discovery of so many of these flowers is a reason for optimism, as it could mean finding more blooms in the area. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviews animal and plant species considered threatened every five years, and scientists hope that by the next review, they will have found enough amoles to remove the plant from the endangered list.\n\nConsidering this amole has been in decline for decades, this finding opens up the possibility for research that could lead to a wealth of new knowledge about the flower.\n\nThe reemergence of the Camatta Canyon amole could help rebalance the local ecosystem, too, making it healthier and more diverse. Not only would that protect endangered species of all kinds, but it would alsobenefit human well-beingby protecting food and water sources, as well as limiting the spread of disease.\n\nHeather Schneider, a senior rare plant conservation scientist at the Santa Barbara Botanical Garden, toldLAist, \"All is not lost.

    "News_title":"Mysterious Object Headed Into Our Solar System Is Coming From the Center of the Galaxy",
    "News_text":"Folks, it's official: the object that astronomersrecently spottedblowing through the outer solar system came from interstellar space.\n\nYesterday, the intriguing stranger was named A11pl3Z. Now, it's earned the esteemed designation 3I\/ATLAS — that \"I\" standing for \"interstellar.\"\n\n3I\/ATLAS is currently located between the orbits of the asteroid belt and Jupiter, theNew York Timesreports, where it's about 416 million miles away from the Sun, NASAsaid. That's equal to four and a half times the distance between the Earth and our star.\n\nBut it's approaching fast. As we speak, 3I\/ATLAS is hurtling toward the inner solar system at a speed of about 130,000 miles per hour — a \"thousand times over the speed limit on a highway,\" Harvard's Avi Loebquipped.\n\n\"This thing is traveling pretty fast,\" Paul Chodas, director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, told theNYT.\n\n\"If you trace its orbit backward, it seems to be coming from the center of the galaxy, more or less,\" Chodas added. \"It definitely came from another solar system. We don't know which one.\"\n\n3I\/ATLAS is only the third confirmed interstellar object to reach our Sun's domain — hence the \"3.\" The first was 'Oumuamua, spotted in 2017, which became famed for its unusually elongated shape. The second, dubbed Borisov, was a comet thatspectacularly began to break apart.\n\nProvisionally, this latest visitoralso appears to be a comet, making it the second known \"rogue\" comet in history.\n\nIts discovery and confirmation as an extrasolar visitor were a collaborative effort.What initially appearedto be an asteroid was first flagged Tuesday by a telescope in Chile that's part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).The International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center quickly added the intriguing object to its list of confirmed near-Earth objects. So did NASA and its Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nSoon, more than 100 observations from telescopes across the globe poured in, including \"tentative reports of cometary activity,\" the Minor Planet Center said Wednesday, providing enough data to designate it 3I\/ATLAS.\n\n\"There's no uncertainty\" about its interstellar origins, Chodas told theNYT, because it's moving too fast to come from our own solar system.\n\nWe can only speculate how it got here. Per theNYT, it probably formed as a comet around another star, before a gravitational interaction, perhaps apassing star, booted it out of itshome system.\n\nHow large 3I\/ATLAS is is also a matter of some debate. If it were a rocky asteroid, the interstellar interloper would have to be about 12 miles wide to reflect the levels of light we're seeing, according to theNYT,which is what astronomers initially estimated.\n\nBut since it's a comet, it's much harder to say. Comets owe their luminous appearance to a halo of gas and dust known as a coma, which is released when the object is heated up by sunlight. These comas appear much larger than the solid object at their center, and their tails even more so; Borisov's was nearly 100,000 miles long, astronomersestimated, or about 14 times the size of the Earth.\n\n\"You can't infer the size of the solid object from the brightness of the coma,\" Chodas told theNYT. \"So it's too early to say how big this object is.\"\n\nThe good news is that there will be plenty of time to study 3I\/ATLAS, which hasn't always been the case in our limited encounters with interstellar visitors; 'Oumuaua, for instance, vanished after just a few weeks.\n\n\"It'll be easily observable for astronomers around the world,\" Chodas told theNYT. \"It should be visible well into next year to large telescopes.\"\n\n3I\/ATLAS is expected to reach its closest approach to the Sun around October 30, NASA said, at a distance of about 130 million miles, putting it inside the orbit of Mars.\n\nMore on:Scientists Investigate What Happens If You Snort Moon Dust",

    "News_title":"'Send them home': To promote tougher policies, report claims Spokane's homeless aren't from here",
    "News_text":"Jul. 4—Half of the homeless people in Spokane aren't from here and should be given bus tickets home, more strictly enforced by police and cut off from long-term services, according to a recent report released by the Spokane Business Association, a prominent political advocacy group funded by businessman Larry Stone.\n\nA week after the report's release, the association proposed an amendment to the city's charter, which if approved by voters would reshape the city's homelessness laws and force Spokane to shift funding away from affordable housing, firefighting equipment and other priorities to fund emergency shelters, more visible police patrols and other policies recommended in the report.\n\nCritics in City Hall have dismissed the report as unscientific, unhelpful and politically motivated ahead of the November elections, when several seats currently or recently occupied by progressives are being challenged by candidates more in line with the Spokane Business Association's policy goals.\n\nBut the report's author and the organization sponsoring the survey argue the data is concrete proof that Spokane's homelessness policies aren't only not helping people get off the streets, they're attracting people from elsewhere who are drawn to the city by lax law enforcement.\n\nJust over 50% of the roughly 230 homeless people surveyed for the association said they moved to the city after becoming homeless.\n\nThis contradicts the federally mandated \"point-in-time\" counts, annual standardized surveys that try to reach every homeless person living on the streets or in a shelter. The point-in-time counts have their own flaws, as the authors of Spokane County's 2024 report readily acknowledged. But of the 2,021 people surveyed in last year's point-in-time count, roughly 80% said they lived in Spokane County before becoming homeless.\n\nRobert Marbut, President Donald Trump's \"homeless czar\" from 2019 to 2021 and the consultant contracted to conduct the survey, argues his data is more accurate because he also asked where people were born, went to high school and whether they have family in Spokane.\n\nIt is not clear why these additional questions would sway the data by 30 points, but Marbut's recommendations for dealing with this influx are clearer, and consistent with the \"Velvet Hammer\" approach he has pitched cities across the country for at least a decade: Spokane has to get tougher with the homeless, pressuring them into treatment or departure.\n\nGavin Coley, an executive of the Spokane Business Association, argued Marbut's expertise lent the report more authority than it lost from a lack of cited sources, and dismissed as \"deeply political\" a recent article from Range Media that turned to an expert in homeless research to pick apart the report's methodology and conclusions.\n\nCooley believes the media and politicians are overly focused on attacking the data and not paying enough attention to the conclusions Marbut reaches with that data.\n\n\"You can certainly note the deficiencies as you see them ... but I think it'd be a pity to miss the higher level order of what's being recommended,\" Cooley said.\n\nEvery effort should be made to send people back where they came from, particularly if they've been in Spokane for less than 90 days, according to the report. Those who stay should be cut off from long-term services, which should be reserved only for those with longstanding ties to Spokane. For those who are from Spokane, the report recommends mandatory treatment services in order to receive housing, which city officials claim would violate state and federal law.\n\nMarbut has spoken out for at least a decade against policies he believes are \"enabling\" the homeless with \"goodies,\" including Housing First policies that have been the national standard since 2013, in which homeless people are given stable housing upfront to enable them to then address addiction, mental health and social reintegration.\n\nAttempts to relocate the homeless en masse are even older. The phrase \"Greyhound therapy\" has been used to describe the practice since the 1970s and has been criticized by researchers for just as long for redistributing the social costs of homelessness rather than improving them. Many of America's largest cities have, at one point or another, attempted similar policies; between 2011 and 2017, the Guardian tracked over 20,000 homeless people given bus tickets out of and sometimes between 16 U.S. cities.\n\nProponents, including the Spokane Business Association, argue that such programs reconnect people to families and friends and can lead to a long-term improvement in their situation.\n\nSpokane's homeless service providers have engaged in the practice for years, however.\n\nIf a homeless person requests a bus ticket, and a friend or family member declares they can take them in, they will be provided a ticket. Julie Garcia, who runs the homeless services organization Jewels Helping Hands, which manages several of the city's homeless shelters, estimated her organization hands out around 250 tickets a year.\n\nThere appears to be little academic research into whether these programs lead to long-term reductions of homelessness or just move it elsewhere. The Guardian reported that, of the thousands being bused from San Francisco through the Homeward Bound program between 2010 and 2015, the city had records of following up with only three people after they reached their destinations.\n\nBut the Spokane Business Association report goes further to suggest that the city should cut off people who decline these tickets from long-term homeless services and even emergency shelters after 21 days.\n\nWhile much of the study copies nearly verbatim a similar report on King County that Marbut was commissioned to write for the Discovery Institute, Marbut claims that Spokane is unusual in one regard: Homeless people aren't coming to Spokane for its quality services, but for its lax enforcement.\n\n\"What we got on the street was generally, they treat me nice here, they don't hassle me,\" Marbut said.\n\n\"It wasn't that they came here because of the services — many communities I go to, it's, 'Oh, they have great services' — but here it was, 'They sort of let me be.' \"\n\nThis picture notably doesn't match what many homeless people on Spokane's streets have told The Spokesman-Review in recent years, who described being pushed from place to place throughout the day by law enforcement, security guards and business owners.\n\n\"We literally don't get to sit down like this,\" said Amber, a 32-year-old homeless woman interviewed under an overpass in August. \"We are moving constantly. ... So many people have cracked feet and heels.\"\n\nCooley dismissed this type of enforcement as an \"occasional blow of the horn,\" and wants to see tougher laws and stricter enforcement — not because he wants them to go to jail, which he says would be ineffective and expensive — but to force people to change their lives.\n\nCooley acknowledged that Washington's involuntary treatment laws are not extensive enough to force a homeless person into drug or mental health treatment.\n\nInstead, he argued, the city should use its tougher homelessness laws to offer them a choice: either go to jail, or enter \"voluntary\" treatment.\n\nOr they could leave, Cooley noted.\n\n\"If you find that a great number of people have no connection to Spokane at all, and you suddenly begin to say you cannot use fentanyl in this community unfettered ... how many of those folks will stick around?\" Cooley asked.\n\nIn an interview, Mayor Lisa Brown dismissed the report as misinformed, arguing many of the report's claims about the city's policies were untrue and some of its recommendations were already standard practice.\n\n\"I believe this is really about the political campaigns in November,\" Brown said, noting Stone's longstanding funding of candidates opposing progressive policies and production of high-dollar videos to encourage tougher homelessness policies.\n\n\"I also believe that, with the resources they are apparently able to mobilize, it would be great if, as a show of good faith, they put them into an actual solution, rather than a propaganda campaign against the city and the majority on the city council,\" Brown added.\n\nBut Cooley believes the evidence was clear, regardless of the survey's findings, that what the city is doing is failing to have a significant impact on the city's visible homeless population or its soaring overdose deaths.\n\n\"I know Seattle really damn well, and I can't believe the rapid turnaround as it relates to enforcement,\" Cooley said. \"And what I don't know is where those people are ... but I know they've made a visible turn in on-street homelessness.\"\n\nThe report has started to leak into the broader public conversation on Spokane's homelessness policies. Wendy Fishburne, vice president of the East Spokane Business Association, appeared to quote parts of it verbatim Monday before the Spokane City Council voted to reform its homelessness laws.\n\n\"Research shows that people do better recovering from addiction when they're surrounded by their families of origin,\" Fishburne said. \"Find out where people actually come from and compassionately send them home ... so that our resources could be used for our folks.\"",

The once-forgotten and now-found bottles were likely filled with cherries before the Revolutionary War in the mid-1770s and have sat sealed—and preserved—ever since.\n\nAs part of a privately funded revitalization project at the Virginia mansion, a brick floor originally laid in the 1770s was torn up, revealing a small pit and the two side-by-side dark green glass bottles, both upright and sealed.\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\nGet the Issue\n\n“Not only did we recover intact, sealed bottles, but they contained organic material that can provide us with valuable insight and perspective into 18th-century lives at Mount Vernon,” Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist, says in astatement. “These bottles have the potential to enrich the historic narrative, and we’re excited to have the contents analyzed so we can share this discovery with fellow researchers and the visiting public.”\n\nOnce the bottles were discovered, each was moved to the Mount Vernon archaeology lab. Experts determined removing the liquid content could help stabilize the glass that hadn’t been directly exposed to the atmosphere for approximately two centuries. Full cherries, including stems and pits, were part of the liquid content, giving off the signature scent of the region, a “blockbuster find of two fully intact glass bottles containing liquid that have not been seen since before the war for American independence,” Doug Bradburn, Mount Vernon president and CEO, says in a statement.\n\nThe glass bottles are from a European manufacturer and archaeologists say, based on shape and style, likely from the 1740s or 1750s, which fits the timeline of needing to be placed in the pit prior to the 1770s floor installation. That makes the cherries likely pre-Revolutionary War fruit.\n\nWhile the Washingtons were known fans of cherries, the picking and storage of the two bottles likely never touched their hands as the sitewas known to haveover 300 enslaved individuals at the time of George Washington’s death.\n\nThe archaeological team plans to ship the bottles off for conservation efforts and the contents will be sent to a laboratory for scientific analysis and testing.\n\nBoroughstellstheWashington Postthat the bottles likely held only cherries when they were originally placed in their location and that amber-colored liquid could be groundwater that got in the bottles once the corks sealing the bottles started to fail as the decades wore on. Despite the liquid and a sort of goo being inside the bottles, early analyses support the only cherry theory, likely stored away to help preserve the fruit for later use in cooking or baking.\n\n“There are 18thcentury accounts that talk about proper ways of preserving fruits and vegetables,” Boroughs tells the newspaper. “One of the most common, especially for berries, is to dry them as much as possible … put them in a dry bottle, cork it … and then bury them.”\n\nThat advice may still hold true today, as the cherries held their shape and scent 250 years later.\n\nGet the Guide\n\nGet the Guide\n\nGet the Guide\n\nGet the Guide\n\nGet the Guide\n\nGet the Guide\n\nGet the Guide\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "News_title":"Trump’s big bill has billions added for Artemis, KSC and moving a space shuttle",
    "News_text":"ORLANDO, Fla. — When President Donald Trump floated his budget for NASA for 2026, it slashed the science budget by half, proposed the end of the Artemis program’s Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and Gateway lunar station, and cut back support of the International Space Station.\n\nWhile Congress will ultimately decide which programs get funded in the federal government’s budget, that may not happen for months. Instead of waiting, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took aim at Trump’s tax and spending bill, which the president has been calling the “big, beautiful bill.”\n\nCruz spearheaded an amendment to shoehorn more than $10 billion into the legislation, also known as a reconciliation bill, to save some ofthose NASA targets. It also sets aside money to move retired Space Shuttle Discovery from its current home at the Smithsonian outside of Washington to Texas.\n\nThe bill was approved by both the Senate and House this week andsigned by Trump on July 4. The added funding falls outside of NASA’s annual budget, and would be available for use over the next seven years.\n\nCruz is the chair of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and initially proposed the amendment “ensuring the U.S. — not China — gets to Mars and gets back to the moon first.”\n\nIt ensures funding to a program that has endured heavy criticism because of years of delays and a ballooning price tag that has cost the nation nearly $100 billion, but has so far only managed one launch.\n\nThat funding includes $4.1 billion for the SLS rockets needed for the Artemis IV and V missions. That is a big win for prime contractor Boeing, which makes the rocket core stages as well as Melbourne-based L3Harris, which produces the core stages’four RS-25 engines.It’s also good news for Northrop Grumman, which makes the SLS’ twosolid rocket boosters, that when combined with the core stage produce 8.8 million pounds of thrust on liftoff.\n\nThe lone flight of SLS on Artemis I in 2022 remains the most powerful rocket to ever reach orbit. Artemis II, which will feature the first crewed flight of Orion, is slated for no later than April 2026 on a mission to fly around, but not land on the moon. Artemis III is still on the calendar for summer 2027, which looks to return humans to the lunar surface for the first time since the end of the Apollo program in 1972.\n\nTrump’s proposed budget still looks to kill off the use of both SLS and the Orion spacecraft after Artemis III, and instead continue its moon and Mars missions using commercial rockets such as SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. It also looks to kill the Gateway lunar space station, parts of which were supposed to be launch on Artemis IV.\n\nCruz’s supplemental funding proposal instead adds $2.6 billion to fully fund Gateway.\n\nBy saving Artemis IV and V with the SLS, that also means the newmobile launcher 2 currently under constructionat Kennedy Space Center may actually get used. It’s designed for the larger versions of SLS on those two missions, which will use a more powerful upper stage designed by the European Space Agency. Those missions are still on NASA’s road map for 2028 and 2029.\n\nBy keeping them, it would also save jobs at KSC. Trump’s proposed budget also seeks to shutter the KSC-based Exploration Ground Systems program, which employs about 500 civil servants and 3,000 contractors. Among all Artemis programs, KSC employs about 700 civil servants and 3,850 contractors, according to NASA.\n\nOn a smaller scale, the proposal also sets aside $20 million toward Lockheed Martin’s Orion capsule for Artemis IV.\n\nOne late addition to the amendment that managed to get through was $85 million set aside to move Space Shuttle Discovery from its current home at the Smithsonian’s Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia to Space Center Houston in Texas.\n\nOther major funding adds include $700 million for a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, which would support the beleaguered Mars Sample Return mission; $1.25 billion to support International Space Station operations over five years until its planned decommissioning in 2030; and $325 million to fund the deorbit vehicle, which is being designed by SpaceX, needed to bring the station back to burn up safely in Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nIt also features $885 million to upgrade NASA facilities including $250 million for Kennedy Space Center to support “construction, revitalization, recapitalization, or other infrastructure projects and improvements” to be allocated no later than fiscal year 2026.\n\n“The One Big Beautiful Bill supports the Artemis Program and invests in NASA centers to keep the U.S. leading in space,” posted Rep. Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., on X. The Space Coast congressman is chairman of the House Space Subcommittee and welcomed the Senate additions to the reconciliation bill. “We’re going back to the moon, on to Mars, and beyond!”\n\nFunding for fiscal 2026, which begins in October this year, won’t be determined until Congress passes that budget bill. But when that will happen is uncertain. The federal government this year is actually running under a continuing resolution that maintained levels from the 2024 budget, meaning NASA’s take has been about $25 billion\n\nIt’s possible funding for fiscal year 2026 will continue under similar resolutions until a full budget is agreed upon.\n\nTrump’s proposal still looks to slash NASA’s budget to $18.8 billion. The biggest loser is more than $3.4 billion cut from science, including $1.15 billion from Earth science, $1 billion from astrophysics, more than $800 million from planetary science and $370 million from heliophysics. It also slashes space technology and zeros out STEM education.\n\nNonprofit group The Planetary Society said the overall budget would be the smallest for NASA since 1961, and called it an “extinction-level event” for NASA’s science efforts, killing 41 science projects, or one-third of NASA’s science portfolio.\n\nThat includes 19 existing missions “that are currently active, healthy, and producing invaluable science,” according to a statement from the Planetary Society. Among them are New Horizons that visited Pluto and is now in the Kuiper Belt; Juno, the only mission near Jupiter; and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. It would also end the UCF-ledGOLD atmospheric science missionthat launched in 2018.\n\n“These represent a cumulative investment of over $12 billion and years of work to design and build. These are irreplaceable assets,” the statement reads.",

    "News_title":"'Send them home': To promote tougher policies, report claims Spokane's homeless aren't from here",
    "News_text":"Jul. 5—Half of the homeless people in Spokane aren't from here and should be given bus tickets home, more strictly enforced by police and cut off from long-term services, according to a recent report released by the Spokane Business Association, a prominent political advocacy group funded by businessman Larry Stone.\n\nA week after the report's release, the association proposed an amendment to the city's charter, which if approved by voters would reshape the city's homelessness laws and force Spokane to shift funding away from affordable housing, firefighting equipment and other priorities to fund emergency shelters, more visible police patrols and other policies recommended in the report.\n\nCritics in City Hall have dismissed the report as unscientific, unhelpful and politically motivated ahead of the November elections, when several seats currently or recently occupied by progressives are being challenged by candidates more in line with the Spokane Business Association's policy goals.\n\nBut the report's author and the organization sponsoring the survey argue the data is concrete proof that Spokane's homelessness policies aren't only not helping people get off the streets, they're attracting people from elsewhere who are drawn to the city by lax law enforcement.\n\nJust over 50% of the roughly 230 homeless people surveyed for the association said they moved to the city after becoming homeless.\n\nThis contradicts the federally mandated \"point-in-time\" counts, annual standardized surveys that try to reach every homeless person living on the streets or in a shelter. The point-in-time counts have their own flaws, as the authors of Spokane County's 2024 report readily acknowledged. But of the 2,021 people surveyed in last year's point-in-time count, roughly 80% said they lived in Spokane County before becoming homeless.\n\nRobert Marbut, President Donald Trump's \"homeless czar\" from 2019 to 2021 and the consultant contracted to conduct the survey, argues his data is more accurate because he also asked where people were born, went to high school and whether they have family in Spokane.\n\nIt is not clear why these additional questions would sway the data by 30 points, but Marbut's recommendations for dealing with this influx are clearer, and consistent with the \"Velvet Hammer\" approach he has pitched cities across the country for at least a decade: Spokane has to get tougher with the homeless, pressuring them into treatment or departure.\n\nGavin Cooley, an executive of the Spokane Business Association, argued Marbut's expertise lent the report more authority than it lost from a lack of cited sources, and dismissed as \"deeply political\" a recent article from Range Media that turned to an expert in homeless research to pick apart the report's methodology and conclusions.\n\nCooley believes the media and politicians are overly focused on attacking the data and not paying enough attention to the conclusions Marbut reaches with that data.\n\n\"You can certainly note the deficiencies as you see them ... but I think it'd be a pity to miss the higher level order of what's being recommended,\" Cooley said.\n\nEvery effort should be made to send people back where they came from, particularly if they've been in Spokane for less than 90 days, according to the report. Those who stay should be cut off from long-term services, which should be reserved only for those with longstanding ties to Spokane. For those who are from Spokane, the report recommends mandatory treatment services in order to receive housing, which city officials claim would violate state and federal law.\n\nMarbut has spoken out for at least a decade against policies he believes are \"enabling\" the homeless with \"goodies,\" including Housing First policies that have been the national standard since 2013, in which homeless people are given stable housing upfront to enable them to then address addiction, mental health and social reintegration.\n\nAttempts to relocate the homeless en masse are even older. The phrase \"Greyhound therapy\" has been used to describe the practice since the 1970s and has been criticized by researchers for just as long for redistributing the social costs of homelessness rather than improving them. Many of America's largest cities have, at one point or another, attempted similar policies; between 2011 and 2017, the Guardian tracked over 20,000 homeless people given bus tickets out of and sometimes between 16 U.S. cities.\n\nProponents, including the Spokane Business Association, argue that such programs reconnect people to families and friends and can lead to a long-term improvement in their situation.\n\nSpokane's homeless service providers have engaged in the practice for years, however.\n\nIf a homeless person requests a bus ticket, and a friend or family member declares they can take them in, they will be provided a ticket. Julie Garcia, who runs the homeless services organization Jewels Helping Hands, which manages several of the city's homeless shelters, estimated her organization hands out around 250 tickets a year.\n\nThere appears to be little academic research into whether these programs lead to long-term reductions of homelessness or just move it elsewhere. The Guardian reported that, of the thousands being bused from San Francisco through the Homeward Bound program between 2010 and 2015, the city had records of following up with only three people after they reached their destinations.\n\nBut the Spokane Business Association report goes further to suggest that the city should cut off people who decline these tickets from long-term homeless services and even emergency shelters after 21 days.\n\nWhile much of the study copies nearly verbatim a similar report on King County that Marbut was commissioned to write for the Discovery Institute, Marbut claims that Spokane is unusual in one regard: Homeless people aren't coming to Spokane for its quality services, but for its lax enforcement.\n\n\"What we got on the street was generally, they treat me nice here, they don't hassle me,\" Marbut said.\n\n\"It wasn't that they came here because of the services — many communities I go to, it's, 'Oh, they have great services' — but here it was, 'They sort of let me be.' \"\n\nThis picture notably doesn't match what many homeless people on Spokane's streets have told The Spokesman-Review in recent years, who described being pushed from place to place throughout the day by law enforcement, security guards and business owners.\n\n\"We literally don't get to sit down like this,\" said Amber, a 32-year-old homeless woman interviewed under an overpass in August. \"We are moving constantly. ... So many people have cracked feet and heels.\"\n\nCooley dismissed this type of enforcement as an \"occasional blow of the horn,\" and wants to see tougher laws and stricter enforcement — not because he wants them to go to jail, which he says would be ineffective and expensive — but to force people to change their lives.\n\nCooley acknowledged that Washington's involuntary treatment laws are not extensive enough to force a homeless person into drug or mental health treatment.\n\nInstead, he argued, the city should use its tougher homelessness laws to offer them a choice: either go to jail, or enter \"voluntary\" treatment.\n\nOr they could leave, Cooley noted.\n\n\"If you find that a great number of people have no connection to Spokane at all, and you suddenly begin to say you cannot use fentanyl in this community unfettered ... how many of those folks will stick around?\" Cooley asked.\n\nIn an interview, Mayor Lisa Brown dismissed the report as misinformed, arguing many of the report's claims about the city's policies were untrue and some of its recommendations were already standard practice.\n\n\"I believe this is really about the political campaigns in November,\" Brown said, noting Stone's longstanding funding of candidates opposing progressive policies and production of high-dollar videos to encourage tougher homelessness policies.\n\n\"I also believe that, with the resources they are apparently able to mobilize, it would be great if, as a show of good faith, they put them into an actual solution, rather than a propaganda campaign against the city and the majority on the city council,\" Brown added.\n\nBut Cooley believes the evidence was clear, regardless of the survey's findings, that what the city is doing is failing to have a significant impact on the city's visible homeless population or its soaring overdose deaths.\n\n\"I know Seattle really damn well, and I can't believe the rapid turnaround as it relates to enforcement,\" Cooley said. \"And what I don't know is where those people are ... but I know they've made a visible turn in on-street homelessness.\"\n\nThe report has started to leak into the broader public conversation on Spokane's homelessness policies. Wendy Fishburne, vice president of the East Spokane Business Association, appeared to quote parts of it verbatim Monday before the Spokane City Council voted to reform its homelessness laws.\n\n\"Research shows that people do better recovering from addiction when they're surrounded by their families of origin,\" Fishburne said. \"Find out where people actually come from and compassionately send them home ... so that our resources could be used for our folks.\"",

    "News_title":"Colorado man arrested a second time for his wife Suzanne Morphew's murder",
    "News_text":"This story previously aired on July 1, 2023. It was updated on July 5, 2025.\n\nBarry Morphew, a longtime suspect in his wife'sSuzanne Morphew's disappearance, has been arrested a second time and charged with her murder after a toxicologist found a unique combination of tranquilizer drugs in her bone marrow, according to a grand jury indictment made public in June.\n\nMorphew has in the past acknowledged using those tranquilizer drugs to knock out deer and cut off their antlers, authorities say.\n\nBarry Morphew was first arrested and charged with Suzanne's murder in 2021, but thosecharges were dismissedwithout prejudice, meaning authorities reserved the right to charge Morphew again. He has always maintained his innocence.\n\nWhen the initial charges were dismissed in April 2022, prosecutors claimed they were close to discovering Suzanne's remains. And on Sept. 22, 2023, agents with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation located her bones in a \"shallow, clandestine grave … less than an hour from the Morphew residence\" just outside Salida, Colorado, according to the most recent grand jury indictment.\n\nAccording to an autopsy report, the coroner's office in El Paso County, Colorado, declared that Suzanne's death was: \"Homicide by unspecified means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication.\"\n\nThose three drugs make up a compound known informally as BAM to hunters who use it to sedate wildlife. The new indictment states that BAM was found in Suzanne's bone marrow. Barry Morphew was known to be an avid deer hunter whose home was filled with deer heads and antlers.\n\nThe indictment links Barry Morphew to purchases of the BAM compound which is a highly controlled drug. It concludes: \"The prescription records show that when Suzanne Morphew disappeared, only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state had access to BAM: Barry Morphew.\"\n\nIn another twist, the indictment noted that Suzanne had not died immediately after being given the drugs. The autopsy revealed that her body had metabolized the BAM. Forensics experts determined she had not decomposed where her bones were found, meaning her remains had to have been moved at least twice.\n\n\"That was not her first grave,\" said Dan \"Dan R\" Ridenour, news director and operations manager at Heart of the Rockies Radio in Salida, CO. He also said he could not fathom why Barry would move Suzanne's body. \"There is not a more recognizable face in Salida than Barry Morphew,\" Ridenour said. \"He's going to take that chance and drive 70 miles to the south and dig a shallow grave? There are too many questions.\"\n\nThe indictment does not answer those questions. Barry was arrested in Arizona but waived extradition to Colorado where he will be held on a $3 million cash bond. There is not yet a date for his homicide trial.\n\nWhen Suzanne first went missing back in 2020, investigators compiled and followed severalbizarre clues—a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen—but lacked direct evidence.\n\nInvestigators noticed Barry Morphew's cellphone appeared to be pinging all around his house on Mother's Day weekend 2020, which he maintains was because he was chasing and shooting at chipmunks. Investigators also found a plastic cap for a syringe that they believe was used to load a tranquilizer dart in the couple's dryer. Barry Morphew, investigators say, told them he didn't know how the cap got there, but admitted he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. The cap, however, did not contain any of Barry's DNA.\n\nInvestigators also found a spy pen right out of a James Bond movie that was able to capture and record conversations. The pen captured several intimate conversations between Suzanne and a secret lover. Investigators also uncovered DNA on the glovebox of Suzanne's Range Rover, which traced back to an unknown male connected to three sexual assaults.\n\nMISSING ON MOTHER'S DAY\n\nDan Ridenour [riding in car with Peter Van Sant]: What happened on this road is a real mystery. No one knows. Where is Suzanne?\n\nIn the days, weeks and months after Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother's Day 2020, her trail went cold, but the mother of two's disappearance had become the biggest story in Colorado.\n\nANDREW MOORMAN [talking to searchers,CBS Denvernews report]:We're gonna fan out and were gonna work that area very carefully, OK?\n\nFour months in, Suzanne's brother, Andrew Moorman, organized a citizen's search. He said he felt he had to do something — anything.\n\nANDREW MOORMAN [to CBS Denver]: I hope to find her alive and at some point, you have to realize when somebody's been missing after so long, that the chances of that diminish dramatically.\n\nThe thought that Suzanne may have been abducted hit the peaceful, picturesque town of Salida hard.\n\nDan Ridenour: I came home every day and my wife asked me, \"had they found her yet?\"\n\nDan Ridenour has covered the story for his local morning show.\n\nDan Ridenour: Barry and Suzanne Morphew were not known well in Salida, Colorado …They had only been here for a couple of years.\n\nBefore moving to Colorado in 2018, Barry and Suzanne grew up in the small town of Alexandria, Indiana, where they met in high school. Suzanne competed for homecoming queen. Barry was a star baseball player who was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays. Injury ended Barry's dreams of a major league career. They both attended Purdue University and married in 1994. He started a landscaping business. Suzanne taught middle school before becoming a full-time mother.\n\nDan Ridenour: They had a couple of daughters … one in college … And they had a daughter in high school …\n\nMacy, 16 years old when her mom disappeared, lived at home. Her sister Mallory attended college and the Morphews told some friends they moved to a home just outside of Salida to be closer to their older daughter. But there were also rumblings about the state of the Morphew's marriage.\n\nDan Ridenour: Maybe a new place, a new — home, new scenery around them … would strengthen their family and therefore strengthen their marriage.\n\nBut the move did not appear to improve the relationship. It was a tough time, says her sister Melinda Moorman.\n\nMelinda Moorman: My sister had sent me a text message … It was very lengthy. It was very powerful. It was very revealing.\n\nIn a Zoom interview, Melinda said she received Suzanne's text two days before she disappeared, and it was boiling over with anger toward Barry.\n\nThe text read in part:\"He's also been abusive emotionally and physically… I feel more angry now. Anger at what I've allowed.\"\n\nMelinda Moorman: Barry was very dominant in the relationship, and my sister was a very passive, gentle soul … he had … a great tendency to overpower, intimidate people to get what he wanted.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what kinda boss was he?\n\nCody Cox: You know, he was real quiet … stern … He knew what he was doin', 'cause that's what he did in Indiana.\n\nCody Cox was part of Barry's landscaping crew for nearly two years when Barry first arrived in Colorado.\n\nCody Cox: I talked pretty highly about Barry 'cause I was with him all the time. And he's like, an inspiration to me almost … he was a real cool guy.\n\nCody said he regularly heard Barry talking to Suzanne as they drove in Barry's truck.\n\nCody Cox: : … they seemed to communicate pretty well. Like I said, I could hear almost every phone call he had.\n\nAnd he says he met Suzanne a handful of times; she even made cookies for his wife and kids.\n\nCody Cox: She was a sweetheart. She was a real kind lady … She's almost like an angel, like somethin' you'd see off a Hallmark movie, you know … real nice, almost too perfect.\n\nCody Cox: So, when I heard about the news, I didn't believe it … I heard it actually on the radio. And I was like, \"Did they just say Suzanne?\" And I was like, \"Oh my gosh. Who'd even wanna hurt her?\"\n\nThe first day authorities searched for Suzanne, they found her mountain bike close to the Morphew home.\n\nPeter Van Sant [at ravine]: Where was the mountain bike found?\n\nDan Ridenour [pointing]: It was found right over this little cliff right here resting on these boulders.\n\nDan Ridenour: She was new at mountain biking. So, an accident is certainly plausible. I would only ask, \"Where's Suzanne?\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: She would have been injured, yeah?\n\nDan Ridenour: She would have been injured.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was there clothing found down here?\n\nDan Ridenour: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was her helmet found down here?\n\nDan Ridenour: No.\n\nInvestigators believe the scene was staged and, days later, they discovered Suzanne's helmet roughly a mile away off Highway 50.\n\nDan Ridenour [riding in car]: The helmet was found on the south side of the road.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, this side of the road?\n\nDan Ridenour: Which would be to our left.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, is the thought somebody threw it out of a window, perhaps?\n\nDan Ridenour: That's the thinking, yes …\n\nIt appeared as though Suzanne could have been abducted, and that's when Barry made a videotaped public plea on social media. In those early days, Barry had a theory about what happened to Suzanne that he shared with Tyson Draper who has his own YouTube channel.\n\nBARRY MORPHEW: Where are you from?\n\nTYSON DRAPER: I'm from Arizona.\n\nBARRY MORPHEW: OK.\n\nBARRY MORPHEW: Let me tell you what happened.\n\nTYSON DRAPER: OK.\n\nThey happened to meet at the site where Suzanne's mountain bike was found and Tyson secretly videotaped Barry:\n\nBARRY MORPHEW [to Draper]: The first night there was a mountain lion that officers seen that walked by the car. So, we thought that maybe she got attacked by a lion.\n\nA mountain lion killed her?\n\nDan Ridenour: If that happened, there would have been signs of that … There would've been blood, there would've been a struggle … So, that was a very short-lived speculation.\n\nAuthorities began to doubt that Suzanne even took a bike ride, especially after her sunglasses and hydration backpack were found in her car.  Investigators also found her driver's license and credit cards in her Range Rover. But her cell phone was missing.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did Barry Morphew cooperate with investigators during the course of this?\n\nAshley Franco: He had been interviewed by investigators through the course of it and he talked to investigators almost every time.\n\nAshley Franco, who reported on the case for the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs,KKTV, has read the police documents and she says Barry has repeatedly told the same story. He came home around 3 p.m. on May 9, 2020 and had a pleasant evening with Suzanne. The next morning, Mother's Day, Barry says he drove to a job some 3 hours away.\n\nAshley Franco: He says the last time he sees his wife is when she's sleeping in their bed.\n\nAs investigators began trying to verify Barry's alibi, they were pulled in a new direction. Suzanne's spy pen had surfaced with that intimate conversation. Now they needed to figure out the identity of \"Jeff,\" Suzanne's lover.\n\nAshley Franco: Could this man have had something to do with Suzanne's disappearance?\n\nSUZANNE'S SECRET LOVER IDENTIFIED\n\nIt was just days after Suzanne Morphew went missing when investigators make that intriguing discovery.\n\nAya Gruber: They discover a spy pen.\n\nPeter Van Sant: A spy pen?\n\nPeter Van Sant: A spy pen.\n\nAya Gruber is a law professor and a former defense attorney.  She has closely studied all the public investigative files in the Morphew case; she knows it was not easy for investigators to find Suzanne's secret lover: a man named \"Jeff.\"\n\nAya Gruber: She hid that affair so well that it took … agents six months to find the man she was having an affair with.\n\n\"Jeff\" turned out to be Jeff Libler and he had a wife and six children in Michigan where he lived. He and Suzanne had a one-time fling after high school. Decades passed until Suzanne reached out to Jeff, out of the blue, in 2018.\n\nAshley Franco: When Suzanne and Barry moved to Colorado, Suzanne messaged him on Facebook.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did she message him?\n\nAshley Franco: \"Howdy Stranger.\" … And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop.\n\nIn the months after Suzanne went missing, Jeff kept quiet.  He only began cooperating after he was located by investigators, who learned Jeff had taken steps to hide the nearly two-year affair.\n\nAya Gruber: What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne. … He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.\n\nJeff told agents he only took those steps because he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory and worried he might lose his family and job. He was also worried agents considered him a suspect.\n\nAya Gruber: … he asks the agents, \"Am I a target?\"\n\nAlthough he did not come forward on his own, Jeff did assist agents after they found him. He agreed to provide access to his DNA, phone records and his passwords for those deleted accounts. By looking through the couple's iCloud accounts and phone records, agents were able to piece together their relationship, including the times they met in person.\n\nAshley Franco: Investigators also found that Suzanne, on several instances, had gone on vacation to meet up with Jeff in many different states, ranging from Louisiana to Florida.\n\nInvestigators also discovered they'd sent intimate photos to each other, talked of becoming husband and wife, and even mentioned leaving the United States.\n\nAshley Franco: Jeff and Suzanne had talked about moving away … moving to Ecuador at one point …\n\nPeter Van Sant: If you were an investigator instead of a law professor, what would you wanna know about this Jeff Libler?\n\nAya Gruber: Everything. I'd wanna know everything about what he was doing, what he was thinking. … Here is somebody who arguably had the last communication … with Suzanne before she went missing.\n\nThe love affair between Suzanne and Jeff became a key part of the investigation as agents tried to figure out what happened to her on that Saturday, May 9, the day before Mother's Day.\n\nRecords show that Suzanne and Jeff messaged each other 59 times that day, much more than usual, authorities say.\n\nAt one point, Suzanne sends Jeff a selfie. Investigators dub it her last \"proof of life\" photo. Barry was not home, as the lovers' texts heat up:\n\nAt 2:05 p.m., Suzanne writes:\"I'm just in love with you. Whatcha up to?\"\n\nJeff's response at 2:06 p.m. was:\"Want to strip down and get naked? LOL??\"\n\nShe responds by saying she'll \"load up\" her WhatsApp account and then at 2:11 p.m., Suzanne writes,\"Okay I'm on WA\".\n\nThen, at 2:26 p.m., Suzanne gets a text from Barry that he's heading home.\"Done headed back.\"\n\nNo one knows if Suzanne saw that text or was preoccupied with Jeff, but she does not answer.\n\nBarry follows up, appearing to wonder where Suzanne is.\"Did you leave?\"\n\nThere was still no response from Suzanne and investigators speculate the next few moments are when Barry returned home. They notice that Barry's cell phone appears to be pinging all around the outside of his house. Was he chasing Suzanne before a final and fatal confrontation?\n\nInvestigators asked Barry to explain that unusual phone activity.\n\nAya Gruber: And he says, \"Well, lemme think about that. I was probably walking around my house shooting chipmunks.\"\n\nYou heard right — it was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi.  Barry says the chipmunks were a constant nuisance at his house and he'd been running around shooting them that day.\n\nAya Gruber: And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him.\n\nThere was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around Barry's house. Part of his problem, Aya says, is that Barry granted between 30 and 40 interviews — all without a lawyer — to everyone from a county detective to members of the FBI.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Would you have allowed him to do all these interviews?\n\nAya Gruber: No. Absolutely not.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Libler was cleared. He told agents he was in Michigan that weekend and his alibi checked out. When investigators tell Barry of the affair, he denies knowing anything about it.\n\nBut if Barry knew nothing about Suzanne's affair, what motive would he have to kill her? One clue may be a deleted text that investigators found on Barry's phone sent by Suzanne just days before: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"\n\nDan Ridenour: So, the only thing that makes sense is that Barry Morphew lost it when Suzanne finally said, \"I'm leaving you.\"\n\nBarry knew that his daughters would be away on their camping trip that Saturday afternoon and authorities say he took advantage of that opportunity to kill Suzanne and clean up the crime scene.\n\nPeter Van Sant: From 2:47 p.m. until 10:17 p.m., just under 8 hours, Barry's phone goes into airplane mode. What do authorities believe happened during that time?\n\nAshley Franco: Authorities say that they believe, when his phone went into airplane mode, that he was disposing of possible evidence.\n\nUnable to track Barry's cell phone, investigators tapped into a relatively new investigative technique — digital vehicle forensics — to pull a stream of data out of Barry's Ford truck. And Barry's truck told a different story than what he was telling investigators.\n\nAshley Franco: They were using Barry's own car against him.\n\nIF A TRUCK COULD TALK —  IN THIS CASE, IT DID\n\nBen LeMere is an expert in the new field of vehicle forensics.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Give me a sense of how your technology, from your company, helps solve criminal cases.\n\nBen LeMere: So, a lotta times it's used to … locate bodies.\n\nLeMere is the CEO of the Berla Corporation.\n\nBen LeMere: It helps … get people convicted. It's helped get people not convicted.\n\nInvestigators from Scotland Yard to the FBI have learned how to use Berla's software to tap into the dozens of computers in a car.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It's accurate enough to be used as evidence in court cases, correct?\n\nBen LeMere: Yes, sir.\n\nCases like the disappearance of Suzanne Morphew. Investigators created a Berla report, meaning they tapped into the data in Barry's Ford truck to track its movements after his cell phone went into airplane mode.\n\nAya Gruber: … a couple of the pieces of evidence that I think are very harmful to his case — come from the data in the car …\n\nAshley Franco: The prosecution's case is that Barry snapped at one point the day before Mother's Day.\n\nAuthorities believe Barry killed Suzanne that afternoon. He told agents he went to bed around 8 p.m. that night, but the data pulled from the truck shows that the truck was put in reverse and moved some 96 feet closer to his house around 9:30 p.m.\n\nAshley Franco: Investigators think that's when he could have loaded Suzanne's body.\n\nInitially, Barry told police that he set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. on Mother's Day and left the house by 5 a.m. to drive to a job site in Broomfield, a town near Denver, 150 miles from Salida. But the truck's computers show that someone was opening and closing the truck's doors around 3:30 a.m.\n\nInvestigators believe Barry began driving toward Broomfield much earlier than he claimed,but there is a 4-hour window—approximately 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.—when no activity was recorded by the vehicle's computers.\n\nAya Gruber: … there are events in the car — that aren't recorded. So, they can't give sort of a full chronological picture.\n\nAnd if Barry hid Suzanne's body during that 4-hour window, the truck's data does not provide answers.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Why is data missing sometimes?\n\nBen Lemere: Well, it gets overwritten. You know, it is a computer … Log files, they only last so long.\n\nBut Barry helped fill in some of the missing data. He told agents he took a left upon leaving his home instead of a right because, even though it was dark, he remembered seeing some elk.\n\nAshley Franco: He saw a herd of elk, and he's a hunter. So, he was interested, and he wanted to get an up-close look.\n\nThat admission was significant to agents because it put him in an area where a key piece of evidence had been recovered.\n\nAshley Franco: Investigators found Suzanne's bike helmet up that road. So, they believe, at that point when he turned left instead of turning right, that he could have been ditching her bike helmet.\n\nAt 8:10 a.m. on Mother's Day morning, the truck's computers again begin recording data. And by then, Barry's cell phone had also come back to life. Agents are able to track Barry's cell and truck movements and can see that he first pulled over at a Broomfield bus stop where he discarded something in a garbage can.\n\nAshley Franco: And then he moves on to a hotel trash can, a McDonald's trash can … a dumpster … in a Men's Wearhouse parking lot, and then back to the hotel, and dumps stuff in a dumpster there. Investigators believe that during these \"trash runs,\" he was disposing of evidence in different places within the Denver area.\n\nIn a surveillance shot of Barry on one of those trash runs, investigators could not see what he was throwing away. It may have looked incriminating, but Barry claims it was just another day at the office. He told agents he was merely being cheap, not criminal.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And his claim, well, I just always have a lotta junk in — in the vehicle. I don't like to pay to have it — disposed at a landfill, I — this is just what I do.\n\nAshley Franco: But it's suspicious that you would go to five different trash areas to dispose of several things. Why not just do it at one?\n\nAfter checking out the work site, Barry headed back to his room at the Holiday Inn, and investigators say he stayed there from 12:42 p.m. to 6:03 p.m. By then, he'd already spoken to older daughter Mallory who told him she could not get in touch with her mother.\n\nThat's when the Morphew neighbors were contacted and could find no sign of Suzanne.\n\nDan Ridenour: Barry asked them at that time if the bike was there, to go check on her … her bicycle is not here.\n\nBarry asks his neighbor to call 911.\n\nDan Ridenour: And that's when the call to 911 … was placed, that Suzanne is missing.\n\nAshley Franco: Barry doesn't head home immediately, and he is dropping some tools off for his coworkers.\n\nTools including a shovel. With Suzanne now officially reported missing, Barry tells his workers there's a family emergency and arranges hotel rooms with one of those workers taking over Barry's room.\n\nAshley Franco: When the employee was interviewed, he told investigators that … the room that Barry checked out of, it had a strong smell of chlorine or bleach.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Which suggests what?\n\nAshley Franco: That he could be cleaning up a crime scene.\n\nJust after 6 p.m., Barry starts driving back to Salida. On the way, Barry speaks to sheriff deputies who advise him they've found Suzanne's bike and he arrives at that ravine at around 8:40 p.m.\n\nAshley Franco: And investigators say that when he arrived there, he was pretty emotional for a few minutes.\n\nBy Sunday night, Suzanne's daughters were back home but Suzanne is nowhere to be found. Barry offered a $100,000 reward for information that was later doubled to $200,000.\n\nInvestigators later discovered many texts from Suzanne to a close friend that apparently revealed her tormented feelings about Barry:\n\n\"He won't speak of divorce …\"\n\n\"I feel no peace when he's here …\"\n\n\"I wouldn't feel safe alone with him …\"\n\nBarry became the prime suspect and investigators think they know how he killed Suzanne.\n\nDID BARRY TARGET SUZANNE?\n\nWhile investigators searched the Morphew home and the family's cars and trucks, Barry continued to talk, seemingly to anyone with a badge. Weeks and months went by and Barry remained at the center of the investigation.\n\nAya Gruber: … police are absolutely correct as a statistical matter to look at intimate partners … when they suspect that a woman might've been harmed or murdered.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It's something like eight out of 10 times, when a spouse dies the other one's involved.\n\nAya Gruber: Absolutely.\n\nSometimes the smallest item will turn an investigation, and, in this case, agents seized on a clear plastic cap that a forensics team had found in the family's dryer. Prosecutors believe the cap was from a syringe used to fill a tranquilizer dart.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How do prosecutors interpret that?\n\nAya Gruber: The prosecution's theory is that at some point, when Barry came home on the 9th and snapped, and decided to murder Suzanne, he used a tranquilizer dart that you would use on animals …\n\nThere was no working tranquilizer rifle found in the Morphew's home. But Barry told investigators he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. He knew how to load darts with paralyzing chemicals, having used them to illegally sedate deer and remove their antlers to sell.\n\nWe asked Dan Ridenour to read some of what Barry told investigators.\n\nDan Ridenour [reading]: Barry said, \"The first thing I thought of when I came here and saw deer in my yard with big horns, I'm like, 'I'm getting them horns.'\"\n\nDan Ridenour [reading]: \"And I'll tell you exactly what I did … I shoot 'em. They go to sleep, I cut their horns off … It's totally illegal … But you're gonna find tranq darts around my property because I've done that.\"\n\nExperts say it can take between 4 and 20 minutes for an animal the size of a deer to drop after being shot with a tranquilizer dart. Agents theorized that Barry's phone had pinged from various locations around the house—not because he was shooting chipmunks, but because he was chasing Suzanne after he shot her.\n\nAshley Franco: Investigators find a doorframe within the Morphew home that has been broken. And they say that there could have been a chase and then a struggle.\n\nAndrew Katers, the owner and CEO of Animal Care and Equipment Services, showed us a tranquilizer rifle he'd typically use on animals.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what are you holding?\n\nAndrew Katers: What I'm holding is a TeleDart model 706 rifle … they use this a lot in parks throughout the country.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And this does not fire bullets or shot?\n\nAndrew Katers: It only fires darts. … It's impossible to — get it to do anything else.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Could you now demonstrate for me?\n\nAndrew Katers: Sure. [fires rifle]\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, if Suzanne had been struck by one of these darts … would she have time to run around, try to escape?\n\nAndrew Katers: She could. But I don't think she would get very far.\n\nPeter Van Sant: For a human being, it could be lethal.\n\nAndrew Katers: For sure.\n\nBolstering the theory that Barry and Suzanne had a confrontation the day she disappeared were apparent scratches seen on Barry's left arm. Agents took the circumstantial evidence they gathered — Barry's apparently suspicious behavior, his contradictory statements, the puzzling data from his truck, Suzanne's disturbing texts and those five trash runs — and brought it all to the district attorney.\n\nOn nearly the anniversary of Suzanne's disappearance, Barry is arrested in May 2021.\n\nNEWS REPORT: Tonight, the husband of Suzanne Morphew is behind bars accused of killing her. … The Chaffee County Sheriff's Office says that Barry Morphew was arrested this morning.\n\nDespite the lack of a body, Barry was charged with first-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence, and a variety of other allegations. He was held without bail and eventually pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn theirarrest affidavit, prosecutors spelled out what they believe happened to Suzanne:\n\n\"It had become clear that Barry could not control Suzanne's insistence on leaving him and he resorted to something he has done his entire life — hunt and control Suzanne like he had hunted and controlled animals.\"\n\nSuzanne's sister Melinda reacted to the news of Barry's arrest.\n\nMelinda Moorman: There are no winners in this story. There are two families who are suffering deeply.\n\nBarry ultimately hired high-profile lawyers from Denver, and, in the summer of 2021, Judge Patrick Murphy heard the prosecution's evidence in open court.\n\nAshley Franco: He decided to hold a preliminary hearing to see if this case had enough evidence to go to trial.\n\nThe defense tried mightily to blunt the state's case, countering that the clear, plastic cap found in the dryer means nothing because no one could say how long it had been there. Furthermore, Suzanne's DNA was found on the cap, not Barry's. And as for that chlorine smell in Barry's hotel room …\n\nAya Gruber: One of the managers from the Holiday Inn had actually communicated to agents that this smell of chlorine existed before Barry Morphew was there … because that room's directly above an indoor pool.\n\nAnd there was one more crucial issue the prosecution had to deal with — one that its own forensic team uncovered. DNA evidence made public for the first time now threatened to destroy the case against Barry.\n\nAya Gruber: This DNA discovery is so significant. The agents swab the inside of Suzanne Morphew's car and they found male DNA on the glove box, and it wasn't Barry Morphew's DNA. He was eliminated.\n\nThe DNA also did not match Suzanne's lover Jeff Libler. But it did partially match the DNA of an unknown male who had attacked other women and it raised a disturbing question: had Suzanne fallen into the hands of a sexual predator?\n\nDA: AUTHORITIES ARE \"CLOSE\" TO FINDING SUZANNE'S BODY\n\nIn September 2021 at the Chaffee County Courthouse in Salida, Judge Patrick Murphy heard arguments about whether there was enough evidence to try Barry Morphew for murder.\n\nAshley Franco: The judge named off three different scenarios, saying, \"Suzanne Morphew left willingly, Barry Morphew could have killed his wife, or someone else abducted Suzanne and killed her.\"\n\nHe said it was \"unlikely\" Suzanne had run off on her own, even though she and lover Jeff Libler had discussed moving to Ecuador.\n\nAshley Franco: The judge says that because of the evidence that's … been presented about how loving Suzanne was toward her daughters and toward her family … that she could never do that.\"\n\nBut the abduction theory could not be so easily dismissed — especially after that mysterious DNA was found in Suzanne's Range Rover. Investigators learned that DNA at least partially matched the profile of an unnamed man connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in Tempe, Phoenix and Chicago.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So how can that DNA end up in her car?\n\nAya Gruber: Well, that DNA can end up in her car if she was the victim, for example, of a serial killer … or if the person was hired or opportunistic … There could also be potentially an innocent explanation that at some point, you know, the person came in contact with the car randomly as a mechanic … but it is very, very curious.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Barry Morphew can stand up and say, \"I'm not your killer. The man whose DNA is in my wife's car, tied to past sexual assaults, that's your killer.\"\n\nAshley Franco: Barry Morphew absolutely could say that. And that's what his defense is banking on in this case.\n\nIn frank language, Judge Murphy gave his opinion of the state's evidence: \"I find that the proof is not evident nor is the presumption great that Mr. Morphew committed first-degree murder.\"\n\nDespite that, the judge ruled there was probable cause to go to trial.\n\nAya Gruber: But this judge was very careful to say, \"Look, I'm finding probable cause here, but it's only because I am looking at all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.\"\n\nMurphy said he was \"obligated\" to set bond for Barry.\n\nAshley Franco: The judge sets $500,000 cash-only bond.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And are they monitoring him in some fashion?\n\nAshley Franco: Barry Morphew is wearing an ankle monitor for them to track him, to make sure that he is staying in Chaffee County.\n\nA few days later on September 20, 2021, Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy are all smiles as they leave the jail. They stand firmly behind their dad. Barry declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview.\n\nBarry Morphew's homicide trial was to begin on April 28, 2022, but in the months leading up to that date Judge Murphy recused himself and and was replaced by Judge Ramsey Lama.. And Barry's defense team, led by attorney Iris Eytan, filed motions asking that prosecutors be sanctioned for \"failing to produce discovery in a timely manner\" including some potentially exculpatory evidence — like the male DNA found in Suzanne's Range Rover.\n\nIris Eytan: There's DNA that is placed on all the critical items of evidence in this case — on the bike, on the bike helmet, in the house, in the car — that is linked to unknown males.\n\nIn April 2022, Judge Lama ruled that prosecutors repeatedly had missed deadlines and had failed to turn over important information in the discovery phase. The judge wrote that while he did not find those actions \"willful … the court does find this pattern to be negligent, bordering on, reckless.\" The judge's penalty was to knock out 14 prosecution witnesses — including experts in DNA and cell phone and vehicle data recovery. They would not, he said, be allowed to testify.\n\nLaw professor Aya Gruber said the case was going to be an uphill battle for prosecutors even before she heard about the most recent sanctions.\n\nAya Gruber: This case is incredibly unique. There are not many … murder cases — where the defendant has been charged with first-degree murder, where there is no body, no blood evidence of any foul play, no eyewitnesses.\n\nOn April 19, 2022, as a pre-trial hearing was about to begin, District Attorney Linda Stanley filed a motion to dismiss the murder charges against Barry Morphew without prejudice, meaning the case could be refiled at a later date. In her motion, the DA pointed to the court's decision to bar \"several key witnesses … without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"\n\nNeither Barry, his daughters nor his lawyer had any advance warning.\n\nIris Eytan: I didn't know a dismissal was coming today, although the writing was on the wall …\n\nIn her motion for dismissal, Stanley told the judge that officials believe they are close to discovering the location of Suzanne Morphew's body. Court papers specifically mentioned \"a remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence\" that will be excavated after five feet of snow melts.\n\nDan Ridenour: Where is Suzanne Morphew's body? That is the million-dollar question.\n\nRemember, there was an approximate four-hour gap not recorded by the computers in Barry's truck on Mother's Day morning 2020. Whether investigators ultimately were able to recover some of that missing data or received a tip about the location of Suzanne's remains is not known.\n\nDan Ridenour: The San Isabel National Forest, again, is 1.1 million acres. There's plenty of places to dispose of — of a body.\n\nDefense attorney Eytan denies Barry has any involvement in his wife's disappearance.\n\nIris Eytan: Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew.  He loves her and he misses her, and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.\n\nAfter the judge granted the motion to dismiss homicide charges against Barry, he walked out of court a free man, flanked as usual by his loyal daughters.\n\nSuzanne's sister Melinda says she agrees with the request to dismiss charges against Barry at this point. She said she hoped that, with more time, searchers will find Suzanne's body and win \"a solid conviction in her murder. This would dispel all rumors of her whereabouts.\"\n\nAnd whatever else happens with the case, Melinda says she hopes her nieces keep one thing in mind.\n\nMelinda Moorman: \"Mallory, Macy … Your mother would have laid down her life for you girls … She would never leave you. She would never forsake you. She loved you with her whole being.\n\nSuzanne Morphew's remains were found in 2023 in a shallow grave about 40 miles south of their home.\n\nThe coroner ruled Suzanne's death a homicide. A combination of drugs commonly used to tranquilize wildlife was found in her bone marrow.\n\nBarry Morphew was rearrested in June 2025 and charged with first-degree murder.  He is being held on $3 million cash-only bail. He maintains his innocence.\n\nAccording tothe indictment, Barry Morphew was the \"only one private citizen living in that entire area of the state\" who had access to those drugs, and he was known to use them to tranquilize deer.\n\nProduced by Paul La Rosa.

    "News_title":"Judge grants motion to dismiss charges in Suzanne Morphew case",
    "News_text":"Case update:Barry Morphew was arrestedin Arizona on June 20, 2025, two days after he was indicted on first-degree murder charges in the case of his wife's death. This was the second time Barry Morphew has been arrested and charged in Suzanne Morphew's death.\n\nIn a high-profile case that has already seen numerous and sometimes odd twists and turns over the past three years, including crucial judicial sanctions, a judge agreed to dismiss all charges againstBarry Morphew, without prejudice, just nine days before he was to stand trial for the first-degree murder of his wife and mother of their two daughters,Suzanne Morphew.\n\nProsecutors, who can re-file charges in the future, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment minutes before a pre-trial conference on April 19, 2022, with D.A. Linda Stanley writing they need to investigate further and believe \"we are close to discovering the victim's body.\"  Stanley also cited the court's decision to exclude \"several key expert witnesses initially endorsed.  Without this crucial evidence and without the victim's body, the People cannot move forward at this time in good faith.\"\n\n\"First I want to say that Mr. Morphew not only was presumed innocent and still is presumed innocent, he is innocent,\" Morphew's attorney, Iris Eytan, said at a press conference after the charges were dropped.  In response to the State pointing to the need to find Suzanne's body, she said, \"Forever they have stated that they don't need a body — that a body is irrelevant.  But you need to know, that in this case, there has been not a single ounce of physical evidence that has been found connecting Mr. Morphew to this … alleged crime.\"\n\nSince Barry Morphew's arrest, his defense attorneys had asked Judge Ramsey Lama, multiple times, to dismiss the charges against him. Over the past several months, they pressed the judge to issue severe sanctions on the prosecution for failing to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence ahead of trial.  And the judge imposed damaging sanctions, including barring 11 of their 16 endorsed expert witnesses — among others, experts in DNA, vehicle data and a cellphone data analyst, as punishment for violating discovery rules. In all, the Court excluded 14 of the prosecution's expert witnesses.  The judge found that DA Stanley and her team repeatedly missed deadlines and failed to turn over important information, writing, \"The People's actions amount to negligent and arguably, reckless disregard\" for their discovery obligations.\n\nIn earlier filings, prosecutors said that the Court did not find willful misconduct associated with any discovery violations, noting \"ultimately the sanctions imposed greatly damage the People's case, tantamount to dismissal, for late disclosures that were not greatly prejudicial, but rather technical in nature.\"\n\nWhen Suzanne Morphew, a Colorado mother of two girls, vanished on Mother's Day in May 2020, authorities wondered if she'd been abducted or if her husband Barry — whom she had threatened to divorce — might have killed her.\n\nInvestigators never expected the case would have so many bizarre twists and turns and eventually involve a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, a \"talking\" truck, mystery DNA and a spy pen right out of a James Bond film.\n\n\"This case is incredibly unique,\" says Aya Gruber, a law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder. \"When you started to dig a little bit deeper, nothing is what it seems.\"\n\nGruber studied thousands of pages of public documents from the prosecutor, investigators and defense attorneys.\n\nSuzanne was reported missing on May 10, 2020. She'd been alone that day because her daughters, Macy, 16, and Mallory, 20, were off on a church-sponsored camping trip and planned to return home later that Mother's Day.\n\nAt the same time,Barry Morphewtold investigators he had left the home early in the morning to drive to a job site some three hours away. He said the last time he saw his wife of 25 years was when she was sleeping in their bed.\n\nAfter Suzanne was officially reported missing by a neighbor, investigators began to examine Barry's story. Friends and relatives told investigators that the marriage was troubled, and agents found a deleted text from Suzanne to Barry on his phone that read: \"I'm done. I could care less what you're up to and have been for years. We just need to figure this out civilly.\"\n\nBut 10 days after Suzanne disappeared, agents were pulled in a different direction when they found a so-called spy pen belonging to Suzanne. The spy pen has a long battery life and is designed to look and write like an ordinary pen.\n\nBut it has one extra feature: it is voice-activated and records conversations. Suzanne had acquired it, she told a friend, because she suspected Barry was having an affair and she hoped to use the pen to gather evidence. But the plan backfired.\n\nInvestigators listened to what the pen had recorded and, although there was no evidence of Barry having an affair, they say they heard \"intimate\" conversations between Suzanne and someone named Jeff.\n\nIt was another twist in a case filled with them.\n\nWithout knowing who Jeff was or his location when Suzanne went missing, they could not eliminate him as a person or interest. It took FBI agents six months before they uncovered his identity: Jeff Libler, a man both Suzanne and Barry knew from their Alexandria, Indiana, high school. Jeff and Suzanne had had a one-time fling after graduation, and she'd reached out to him in 2018 after the Morphews moved to Colorado with a Facebook message that read simply: \"Howdy stranger.\"\n\n\"And from that moment they had talked almost every single day nonstop,\" said Ashley Franco, a reporter forKKTV, the CBS affiliate in Colorado Springs, who has covered the story from the beginning.\n\nThat was enough to ignite a nearly two-year love affair. Jeff had a wife and six children. He lived in Michigan and claimed to be there with his family on the day Suzanne vanished.\n\nAgents eventually discovered the lovers had spoken to each other for dozens of hours, often communicating via secret accounts on WhatsApp and LinkedIn. Jeff also admitted that they met for romantic rendezvous in New Orleans, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Indiana.\n\nAfter Suzanne disappeared in May 2020, Jeff did not contact authorities. Instead, agents say, he deleted the accounts where he had communicated with Suzanne.\n\n\"What he did was delete all his social media accounts that he had used to communicate with Suzanne,\" says Gruber. \"He's got a lot to lose if revelations of this affair come out.\"\n\nJeff reportedly told agents he did not want to tarnish Suzanne's memory, but he also told them he worried that he'd lose his wife, children and job. He also worried he might be considered a suspect. \"He asks the agents, 'Am I a target?'\" says Gruber.\n\nAfter agents confronted him, he did cooperate, providing a sample of his DNA and passwords to the deleted accounts. Investigators eventually were able to retrace the couple's steps and recovered texts by tapping into the iCloud accounts of Jeff and Suzanne.\n\nJeff was able to provide receipts for a home goods store he'd visited in Michigan on the day Suzanne vanished and he was eventually cleared.\n\nInvestigators still had their suspicions about Barry Morphew. They never uncovered any evidence that he was having an affair, but investigators found his actions on that Mother's Day weekend to be suspicious.\n\nThey asked Barry why his phone seemed to be pinging all around his house on the day before Mother's Day and he told them he must have been out shooting chipmunks, which he said were a constant nuisance at the house.\n\nIt was perhaps the world's first chipmunk alibi, but Barry stood by it, saying he'd shot 85 chipmunks in the two years he owned that Colorado house.\n\n\"And then that confession to shooting chipmunks becomes a major piece of incriminating evidence against him,\" says Gruber.\n\nVan Sant asked why. \"Because [agents are] saying, 'Well, you know, now he's admitting to having run around the house. And this is a ridiculous explanation, so it must be the explanation of a guilty person,'\" says Gruber.\n\nWhat's more, there was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around the house and neighbors did not recall hearing any type of disturbance during that period of time.\n\nCases sometimes turn on the smallest of things and, in this case, agents seized upon just such a small item.\n\nAgents had found a small clear plastic cap in the family's dryer that they believed was from a syringe used to inject chemicals into a tranquilizer dart. Barry acknowledged he knew how to inject chemicals into a dart and that he'd shot many deer for trophies and so he could get their antlers. His garage was filled with deer heads and a pile of antlers. However, there was no working tranquilizer gun found in the home and authorities say Barry's DNA was not on that plastic cap.\n\nEven so, investigators developed a theory that Barry had shot Suzanne with a tranquilizer gun and then chased her around the house before she passed out. They found a door frame that was broken and suspected there had been a confrontation.\n\nAgents also tapped into a new investigative tool called digital vehicle forensics. They pulled data from his Ford truck's many computers and got the truck to \"talk\" to them. They learned that when Barry said he was sleeping, the truck's doors were opening and closing.\n\nHe wasarrested and chargedwith first-degree murder and other crimes in May 2021. Suzanne's body has not been found and prosecutors presume she is dead. Barry eventually pleaded \"not guilty.\"\n\nBut at the eleventh hour, there was one more twist revealed for the first time publicly at a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence for probable cause.\n\nProsecutors admitted at a hearing held in the summer of 2021 that their own forensics team had uncovered DNA evidence that threatened to destroy their case against Barry. State technicians had found DNA on the glove compartment of Suzanne's car that partially matched an unknown male connected to three unsolved sexual assault cases in three different cities.\n\nBarry Morphew and Jeff Libler were excluded from that DNA sample which meant there was a chance Suzanne had fallen into the hands of a sexual predator. \"This DNA discovery is so significant,\" Gruber said. \"All of a sudden, the seemingly implausible becomes more possible.\"\n\nJudge Patrick Murphy was candid in his assessment of the case, saying it could go either way before a jury. He found enough probable cause to put it over for trial but ordered that Barry be released on $500,000 bond, observing that he thought there was not \"a fair likelihood\" that Barry would be convicted by a jury. Barry entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.\n\nBarry Morphewraised the bond money and is free awaiting trial.  Judge Murphy disqualified himself because of a potential conflict of interest involving a witness, and Judge Ramsey Lama was appointed in January 2022.  Morphew's trial, which was moved from Chaffee to Fremont County, Colorado, was scheduled to begin on April 28.\n\nThen, on April 19, Stanley and her team filed the motion to drop all charges, without prejudice, until they gather more evidence.  But Morphew's attorney, Iris Eytan, argued that the case should be dismissedwithprejudice so that itcannotbe refiled.  The court dismissed the charges without prejudice.\n\nAt the press conference outside court, Eytan made it clear her opinion that her client should never have been charged.\n\n\"These charges were false from the beginning … The prosecution was manufacturing a murder case,\" she said.  \"You've seen shows called 'Making a Murderer?' That's what was happening here in this courtroom … They absolutely dismissed this case at this point because they knew they were going to lose this trial and Mr. Morphew was going to be acquitted and exonerated.\"\n\n\"Barry Morphew loves Suzanne Morphew,\" Eytan said. \"He loves her and he misses her and he wants to know where Suzanne Morphew is.  It's a big question mark … Definitely there was not any evidence, even close to convicting him of murder of his wife.\"\n\nAs investigators continue searching for Suzanne Morphew's body, focusing on a \"remote and mountainous region nearby the Morphew residence,\" as the DA wrote in her motion, waiting for five feet of snow to melt before they can safely excavate the area, Barry Morphew, alongside his daughters, walked out of the Fremont County courthouse a free man. With all charges against him dropped, his bond is lifted, his GPS ankle monitor removed, and his passport returned.  And about 1,000 people who had been summoned to appear for jury selection are released.\n\nIn May 2023, Barry Morphew filed  a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted.\n\nICE raids in California turn violent after protesters clash with agents\n\nOne year after Thomas Crooks tried to kill President Trump, here's what's known about him\n\nUdemy is Powering Enterprise AI Transformation Through Skills",

    "News_text":"Researchers in Texas were over the moon when they discovered three tiny cubs cuddled up with their mother while carrying out a routine black bear den check.\n\nAsreported by Chron, Ph.D. student Cailitin Camp Pappas and former master's student Nicole Dickan made the unexpected discovery while carrying out routine checks in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas. The researchers are affiliated with theBorderlands Research Instituteat Sul Ross State University.\n\nThe bears were once considered eradicated in this region, but have slowly been making a comeback from populations in northern Mexico. The research team has been tracking this comeback, and this current finding is particularly good news.\n\nThe researchers were monitoring the female bear, who had been collared as part of a long-term study on black bear ecology and reproduction in the region, Chron reported. The researchers were able to safely anesthetize and monitor the mother under scientific research permits while they examined and measured the cubs.\n\nThe bears making a comeback in this region is incredibly important because it highlights nature's resilience and the potential for ecosystems to recover when given the chance. Bears play a key role in ecosystems by facilitating seed dispersal, improving soil fertility, and helping maintain the natural balance.\n\nAnd it's not just bears. Conserving populations of a wide range of animals and plants can help improve the health of a variety of ecosystems, which is important for human populations and the planet overall. We rely on healthy ecosystems for a range of vital resources, including clean air and water, as well as most of the food we eat.\n\nAdditionally, restoring wildlife can help heal and restore cultural connections. For example, the reintroduction of bison in Montana has provided a significant cultural boost for the Assiniboine (Nakoda) and Gros Ventre Tribes (Aaniiih). The presence of the animals enabled the communities to reconnect with the traditions that were disrupted when the bison were hunted to near extinction. In this way, the restoration of wildlife populations can help to achieve positive changes for both nature and communities.\n\nDo you think we should be trying to pull pollution out of the atmosphere?\n\nAbsolutely\n\nI need to know more\n\nIn some situations\n\nNo way\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nJoin ourfree newsletterforgood newsanduseful tips, and don't missthis cool listof easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "News_title":"Alphabet’s Isomorphic Labs has grand ambitions to ‘solve all diseases’ with AI. Now, it’s gearing up for its first human trials",
    "News_text":"Alphabet’s Isomorphic Labs is preparing to launch human trialsof AI-designed drugs, its president, Colin Murdoch, toldFortune. Born from DeepMind’s AlphaFold breakthrough, the company is pairing cutting-edge AI with pharma veterans to design medicines faster, cheaper, and more accurately.\n\nAlphabet’s secretive drug discovery arm, Isomorphic Labs, is getting ready to start testing its AI-designed drugs in humans, Colin Murdoch, Isomorphic Labs president andGoogleDeepMind’s chief business officer, toldFortune.\n\n“There are people sitting in our office in King’s Cross, London, working, and collaborating with AI to design drugs for cancer,” Murdoch said during an interview in Paris. “That’s happening right now.”\n\nAfter years in development, Murdoch says human clinical trials for Isomorphic’s AI-assisted drugs are finally in sight.\n\n“The next big milestone is actually going out to clinical trials, starting to put these things into human beings,” he said. “We’re staffing up now. We’re getting very close.”\n\nThe company, which was spun out ofDeepMindin 2021, was born from one of DeepMind’s most celebrated breakthroughs, AlphaFold, an AI system capable of predicting protein structures with a high level of accuracy.\n\nInteractions of AlphaFold progressed from being able to accurately predict individual protein structures to modeling how proteins interact with other molecules like DNA and drugs.\n\nThese leaps made it far more useful for drug discovery, helping researchers design medicines faster and more precisely, turning the tool into a launchpad for a much larger ambition.\n\n“This was the inspiration for Isomorphic Labs,” Murdoch said of AlphaFold. “It really demonstrates that we could do something very foundational in AI that could help unlock drug discovery.”\n\nIn 2024, the same year it released AlphaFold 3, Isomorphic signed major research collaborations with pharma companiesNovartisandEli Lilly.\n\nA year later, in April 2025, Isomorphic Labs raised $600 million in its first-ever external funding round, led by Thrive Capital.\n\nThe deals are part of Isomorphic’s plan to build a “world-class drug design engine,” a system that combines machine learning researchers with pharma veterans to design new medicines faster, more cheaply, and with a higher chance of success.\n\nAs part of the deals with major pharma players, Isomorphic supports existing drug programs, but it also designs its own internal drug candidates in areas such as oncology and immunology, with the aim of eventually licensing them out after early-stage trials.\n\n“We identify an unmet need, and we start our own drug design programs. We develop those, put them into human clinical trials… we haven’t got that yet, but we’re making good progress,” he said.\n\nToday, pharma companies often spend millions attempting to bring a single drug to market, sometimes with just a 10% chance of success once trials begin. Murdoch believes Isomorphic’s tech could radically improve those odds.\n\n“We’re trying to do all these things: speed them up, reduce the cost, but also really improve the chance that we can be successful,” he says. He wants to harness AlphaFold’s technology to get to a point where researchers have 100% conviction that the drugs they are developing are going to work in human trials.\n\n“One day we hope to be able to say — well, here’s a disease, and then click a button and out pops the design for a drug to address that disease,” Murdoch said. “All powered by these amazing AI tools.”\n\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com",

    "News_text":"Jul. 6—OREGON — The attorney for a Mt. Morris man accused of shooting and killing his stepson after an argument in their Mt. Morris apartment in April told an Ogle County judge on July 2 that he needs more time to examine information given to him by prosecutors.\n\n\"The state has provided a substantial amount of discovery,\" Assistant Public Defender Eric Morrow told Judge Anthony Peska. \"It's going to take me awhile to go through it.\"\n\nDerek Swanlund, 45, is charged with first-degree murder in connection with the April 21 death of Cameron Pasley, 25, also of Mt. Morris, in what police described as a \"domestic\" incident.\n\nSwanlund is facing three counts of first-degree murder and a misdemeanor charge of using a Smith & Wesson 9 mm handgun without having a Firearm Owner's Identification card.\n\nDuring an April hearing, prosecutors said the Mt. Morris Police Department responded first to the scene after receiving a 911 call at 4:59 p.m. from Pasley's mother, in which she said her husband had shot her son.\n\nWhen a Mt. Morris police officer arrived at the scene, she saw Swanlund walking away from the apartment complex while carrying a black and silver handgun in his right hand, police said.\n\nAssistant State's Attorney Melissa Voss said a verbal argument inside the apartment evolved to \"shoulder bumping\" with Pasley, after which Swanlund shot Pasley.\n\nWhen more officers arrived at the scene, they discovered Pasley inside the apartment, bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds, Voss said.\n\nPasley was pronounced dead at OSF Saint Katharine Medical Center in Dixon after being taken from the scene by Mt. Morris EMS.\n\nPasley's mother told police she had entered a different room after arguing with Swanlund and after he \"belly bumped\" her into her son. She then heard Pasley say 'He shot me,' \" Voss told the court.\n\nMorrow said Swanlund had no criminal history other than one misdemeanor charge for which he received and completed court supervision. He said Swanlund had bought the gun legally when he lived in North Carolina.\n\nIn arguing for Swanlund to be released, Morrow said Swanlund had lived in Mt. Morris for 10 years, had been consistently employed while residing there, and cooperated with police when they arrived at the scene.\n\n\"He was not aggressive in any way,\" Morrow said during the April detention hearing as he argued for Swanlund's release while his case proceeds through the court system.\n\nMorrow said conditions could be set by the court to enable Swanlund to be released from custody, such as having no contact with the victim's family, electronic monitoring, home detention, and being ordered to stay out of Mt. Morris.\n\nVoss disagreed, arguing Swanlund \"was walking away with blood on his shoes\" when he was apprehended.\n\nPeska denied Morrow's request to release Swanlund from custody, saying an argument \"escalated to shoulder bumping and then escalated to retrieving a gun and shooting his stepson\" multiple times.\n\nOn July 2, Peska set the next court hearing for 1 p.m. Aug. 27, and remanded Swanlund to the Ogle County Jail.\n\nPasley was a 2018 graduate of Oregon High School and a full-time custodian, previously the night custodian at the Blackhawk Center, where the school's physical education classes and competition basketball and volleyball games are held, and had recently moved to days.",

    "News_title":"13 Juice Recalls That Impacted Millions",
    "News_text":"If you've been keeping an eye on the news and thinking thatfood recalls are on the rise, you're not imagining things. Major recalls seem to be hitting headlines on a near-daily basis and some are even deadly, as was the case with thedeadliest food recallof 2025 thus far, wherein supplement shakes killed 14 and hospitalized 41 unlucky individuals.\n\nSome foods are recalled more often than others, with the foods most likely to be recalled including raw meats, deli meats, and produce -- but what about juice? If you think that the only potentially dangerous thing lurking in that carton or bottle of juice in your fridge is the high fructose corn syrup or Red Dye 40, think again. You might just want to check your glass twice before you take that next sip.\n\nJuice is recalled on the regular, and for some truly frightening reasons, from the discovery of bits of metal and plastic floating around in household name-brand fruit juices to cleaning products being found in pouches of Capri Sun. Here are some of the most extensive juice recalls, impacting millions over the last three decades.\n\nRead more:Canned Foods You Should Avoid At All Costs\n\nIn the spring of 2025, Martinelli's, a historic juice and cider brand based in California, issued a recall for its apple juice. The recall impacted more than 170,000 bottles of apple juice that had been distributed across more than half of the United States. The reason? Elevated levels of patulin.\n\nIf you're not familiar with patulin, it's a naturally occurring mycotoxin (which is just a fancy word for a fungus-produced toxin). Mycotoxins are found in all sorts of foods, from various fruits like apples to nuts and spices. While recognizing that patulin is a risk and that it can't be killed via pasteurization, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does allow for a small portion of patulin in apple juice products.\n\nWhile the levels of patulin in Martinelli's were found to be \"elevated\" (perNBC News), it wasn't reported whether or not those levels exceeded the legal limit. Even if that wasn't the case, though, patulin is more likely to occur in elevated levels when apple juice is made from spoiled fruit -- and do you really want to drink juice made from a moldy apple?\n\nIt's not just patulin that might appear in your apple juice. In 2024, Refresco Beverages recalled more than 100,000 cases of apple juice that had been sold at Walmart under the Great Value brand, as well as at other major chains under their own brands, including Weis, Walgreens, and Aldi.\n\nThe juice was recalled as it contained arsenic above the legal levels. (Yes, just as is the case with patulin, the FDA does allow for a certain amount of arsenic in your food.) Arsenic can enter the food supply in both organic and inorganic forms, from the soil or via environmental pollution. If you eat just a little arsenic, you might experience gastrointestinal distress, heart rhythm abnormalities, or pins and needles in your hands and feet. However, long-term exposure can cause cancer and eating enough will, of course, kill you. The government considers a \"high level\" of arsenic to be 60 parts-per-million.\n\nFor many millennials,Capri Sun is the flavor of summer. Unfortunately, in 2022, that flavor was more than a little off. That year, parent company Kraft Heinz issued a recall for 5,760 cases of its wild cherry-flavored Capri Suns. The company said that a diluted cleaning product that was typically used on its processing equipment, had potentially made its way into the actual juice drink blend. The scariest bit? The recall wasn't actually issued until customers began complaining that the Capri Suns tasted weird. At that point, the potential accident was uncovered. Luckily, there were no reports of anyone coming to any harm after drinking the contaminated juices.\n\nWe all want our foods processed and manufactured in clean spaces, but cleaning products really need to be kept far away from the actual food. This is hardly the first time in recent history that a cleaning product-related recall has been issued. In March 2025, for example, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled more than 200,000 pounds of liquid egg products (Egg Beaters), after discovering they might contain a cleaning solution made with sodium hypochlorite, aka bleach.\n\nIn 2019, World Waters, which makes WTRMLN WTR, recalled its cold-pressed watermelon juices that were, at the time, being sold at major chains across the country, including at Walmart, Winn-Dixie, and Publix. The company said that some consumers could possibly find small bits of soft plastic floating around in their juice, which could prove a choking hazard (and plus, it's just not something you want to eat).\n\nPlastic contamination is one of themost common reasons food is recalled, as is metal contamination. Used both in packaging and in the manufacturing and production processes, the two substances often break apart and wind up in everything from frozen pizzas to cans of soda. While it's estimated that the average human eats about 5 grams of plastic per week, via consuming microplastics, which is about the amount of plastic in a credit card, you certainly don't want to eat more of it -- so if you find a piece of plastic in your food, do yourself (and other unassuming consumers) a favor and report it to the brand.\n\nIt's not just food recalls in general that are up. Hospitalizations related to food recalls have also increased. AU.S. PIRG Education Fundanalysis found that, in 2024, the number of food recall-related illnesses increased, year over year, while the number of hospitalizations and deaths actually doubled. Luckily, no one died during a High Hill Ranch apple juice recall in 2015, but one individual was hospitalized.\n\nThe ranch had sold some raw apple juice that sickened more than a dozen people, with the juice testing positive for E. coli. The ranch issued a statement at the time that suggested that perhaps the presence of E. coli was due to ranch visitors with dirty hands touching their free sampling station, rather than anything the ranch had done incorrectly in its food production and handling processes. The ranch did, though, stop selling its unpasteurized apple juice. E. coli, a bacteria that lives in animals' lower intestines, can only be killed by cooking foods to 158 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter.\n\nYou might enjoy a glass of milk with breakfast, as well as a glass of orange juice, but no one's mixing these two breakfast beverages together, in one cup. However, that was basically the reason for a 2014 recall, when regional chain Lehigh Valley Dairy reported that some of its orange juice may have contained milk, too. The orange juice had been distributed across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, as well as under the Price Chopper grocery store brand. The milk ended up in the OJ due to a manufacturing error.\n\nWhile this may not seem like a big deal to some -- just throw it out if you pop open your OJ to find a milky surprise -- for others, milk contamination is a serious worry. Milk allergies, which are more common in children, can cause symptoms ranging from the uncomfortable (hives, itching, coughing, vomiting) to the deadly (anaphylaxis). As such, the FDA treats items with undeclared milk in them (whether that inclusion is purposeful or a mistake, as was the case here) very seriously.\n\nIt's a general good rule of thumb that, if your food's packaging is swelling, throw it out. Bulging and swelling are some of the main hints that a can of food, for example, may contain the toxin that could cause botulism, a toxin that's life-threatening to the point that it's considered a potential terror weapon. As such, it was probably a good idea, in 2014, when Evolution Fresh recalled nearly 2,000 bottles of its organic sweet greens and ginger juice, because the bottles were mysteriously swelling. The juice had been sold in California and Nevada, in various grocery stores.\n\nAt the time, Starbucks owned Evolution Fresh and this was far from the only recall to plague the chain over the years.Starbucks recalls have affected millionsover the chain's lifetime and, in 2014, the chain was also dealing with a Bodum coffee press recall, due to the presses breaking while in use, causing multiple injuries. Starbucks sold Evolution Fresh to juice brand Bolthouse Farms (which has had its own recall worries) in 2022.\n\nRegional grocery chain Wegmans recalled two of its organic fruit juices -- its Food You Feel Good About Organic Apple Juice and Food You Feel Good About Organic Cranberry Juice Blend -- due to an issue not uncommon in the apple juice industry. Like Martinelli's would later discover in 2025, Wegmans found mold byproduct patulin in its juice.\n\nIf you see an apple that's turned brown and rotted, or that shows off some blue mold, there's a chance it contains a dangerous level of patulin. However, these visible markers aren't always present, which is how the sneaky, patulin-bearing bad apple can make its way into a juice press. From there, while the fruit juice production process can overall lower the amount of patulin in the final product, it might not lower that amount to the degree that the juice will be considered safe by federal standards. If you do eat patulin, studies suggest that you might experience gastrointestinal stress at best; at worst, the substance is a carcinogen.\n\nIn 2012, PepsiCo recalled nearly 300 multipacks of Tropicana Kids orange juice, as it was reported that the drinks contained contaminated water. What exactly the water was contaminated by is up for debate, though, as initial reports simply mentioned a microbiological contamination, which is a broad term that could be linked to anything from viruses and bacteria to fungi and protozoa. The packaging only include the contaminated water, no orange juice at all.\n\nTropicana has faced numerous recalls over the years. In 2002, Tropicana recalled 100,000 jugs oforange juicethat had been offered at Sam's Club stores across the country, after it was discovered the orange juice had been contaminated with a cleaning solution. In this instance, a consumer was harmed, needing medical care to treat a burning sensation in their mouth and stomach following drinking the liquid. Other consumers sniffed the OJ before sipping, and returned the drink to stores with complaints.\n\nIt's allbad news for Tropicana, which has seen financial woesin recent history. This includes decreases in income and revenue that can be tracked to lessened market demand and declining orange harvests, necessitating a $30 million emergency loan.\n\nIn 2006, three individuals went to a hospital complaining of vision problems and muscle weakness. Just a few days later, all three patients were on ventilators and, following an investigation into what they had all eaten, it was found that they had all shared a bottle of Bolthouse Farms carrot juice. Later in the month, another patient who'd consumed the carrot juice was also hospitalized, paralyzed, and put on a ventilator.\n\nBolthouse Farms, of course, issued a recall for the product, which had been distributed across the country and in Canada. At the time of the recall, it was suggested that perhaps the four people who had fallen seriously ill had not properly refrigerated the carrot juice. Improper refrigeration can indeed cause the toxins that result in botulism to build up and, in fact,one studyfound that 37 cases of botulism, including four botulism-linked deaths, occurred in the United States between 1994 and 2021, all trackable to inadequate refrigeration, whether in the consumers' homes or in the stores before purchase. Still, to be on the safe side, a recall was issued.\n\nIt's not just your liquid juice you have to worry about. In 2000, Minute Maid recalled its frozen juice bars, a decision that impacted 300,000 boxes of the product, due to the bars containing food-grade plastic. The non-toxic plastic particles were large enough that they were deemed a choking hazard. As for the \"food grade\" bit, no, that doesn't mean that the plastic is necessarily any safer to eat. Instead, food-grade plastics are BPA-free and tested to ensure they won't leach out toxic chemicals when they're in contact with your food -- think a plastic cup or bowl.\n\nJust as recalls have made Tropicana's life a little harder, even though this particular recall occurred more than 25 years ago, it was still a blow for Minute Maid. At the time, the company was struggling to increase its earnings -- though optimistic that the recall wouldn't cause any long-term problems. A decade later, that hope seemed to have panned out, with the Coca-Cola-owned Minute Maid boasting a higher value than Pepsi-owned Tropicana.\n\nThe brand's still not free of all recalls, though. In 2024, it had to recall more than 13,000 cases of Minute Made Zero Sugar Lemonade due to a mislabeling error (the product inside each can was lemonade, but not zero-sugar lemonade). In 2021, the brand recalled fruit punch products due to the worry that some of the packaging could contain some missing metal bolts and washers.\n\nIn June 1999, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed that it had identified or was investigating nearly 300 cases of salmonella-linked food poisoning that had occurred over the United States and Canada. Throughout the salmonella outbreak, a significant number of the patients treated reported drinking Sun Orchard unpasteurized orange juice. As a result, the brand recalled its juices. Eventually, the CDC tracked the origin source of the salmonella to a Mexican juice producer that had supplied Sun Orchard with some of its product, prompting the federal government to begin testing juice at the Mexican border.\n\nHowever, this would only be the first juice recall for the brand in 1999. Later, in November, Sun Orchard recalled another nearly 4,000 gallons of salmonella-contaminated orange juice, which had this time been distributed throughout Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington, to primarily food service establishments (meaning any impacted consumers would have likely drank the orange juice at a restaurant).\n\nVery rarely do food recalls make headlines to such a degree that they get their own Wikipedia pages, but this recall can boast one, tragically. In 1996, an E. coli outbreak impacted consumers across Canada and the Western United States, after they drank Odwalla's unpasteurized apple juice and products containing that apple juice. By the end of the outbreak, nearly 70 individuals had fallen ill and a 16-month-old child had died. Others developed life-threatening conditions.\n\nAs a result, the company not only recalled all of its apple juice products, but it ended up pleading guilty to criminal charges, making waves as the first criminal conviction of its type and the largest criminal fine in a case of this type to date, with Odwalla on the hook for $1.5 million. The company also paid the victims' medical bills and newly began flash-pasteurizing all its apple juice, after admitting that it did not know E. coli could be found in unpasteurized juice. Not only, though, does unpasteurized juice harbor E. coli, but it also can contain hepatitis A, salmonella, and cryptosporidium.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness,join The Takeout's newsletter.

    "News_title":"Opinion - The New York Times wants your private ChatGPT history — even the parts you’ve deleted",
    "News_text":"Millions of Americans share private details with ChatGPT. Some ask medicalquestionsor share painfulrelationship problems. Others even use ChatGPT as a makeshifttherapist, sharing their deepest mental health struggles.\n\nUsers trust ChatGPT with these confessions because OpenAIpromised themthat the company would permanently delete their data upon request.\n\nBut last week, in a Manhattan courtroom, a federal judge ruled that OpenAI must preserve nearly every exchange its users have ever had with ChatGPT — even conversations the users had deleted.\n\nAs it stands now, billions of user chats will be preserved as evidence in The New York Times’scopyright lawsuitagainst OpenAI.\n\nSoon, lawyers for the Times will start combing through private ChatGPT conversations, shattering the privacy expectations of over 70 million ChatGPT users who never imagined their deleted conversations could be retained for a corporate lawsuit.\n\nIn January,The New York Times demanded— and a federal magistrate judgegranted— an order forcing OpenAI to preserve “all output log data that would otherwise be deleted” while the litigation was pending. In other words, thanks to the Times, ChatGPT was ordered to keep all user data indefinitely — even conversations that users specifically deleted. Privacy within ChatGPT is no longer an option for all but a handful of enterprise users.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Sidney Steinupheldthis order. His reasoning? It was a “permissible inference” that some ChatGPT users were deleting their chats out of fear of being caught infringing the Times’s copyrights. Stein also said that the preservation order didn’t force OpenAI to violate its privacy policy, whichstatesthat chats may be preserved “to comply with legal obligations.”\n\nThis is more than a discovery dispute. It’s a mass privacy violation dressed up as routine litigation. And its implications are staggering.\n\nIf courts accept that any plaintiff can freeze millions of uninvolved users’ data, where does it end? Could Apple preserve every photo taken with an iPhone over one copyright lawsuit? Could Google save a log of every American’s searches over a single business dispute? The Times is opening Pandora’s box, threatening to normalize mass surveillance as another routine tool of litigation. And the chilling effects may be severe; when people realize their AI conversations can be exploited in lawsuits that they’re not part of, they’ll self-censor — or abandon these tools entirely.\n\nWorst of all, the people most affected by this decision — the users — were given no notice, no voice, and no chance to object. When one user tried to intervene and stop this order, the magistrate judgedismissedhim as not “timely,” apparently expecting 70 million Americans to refresh court dockets daily and maintain litigation calendars like full-time paralegals.\n\nAnd last Thursday, Stein heard only from advocates for OpenAI and the Times, not from advocates for ordinary people who use ChatGPT. Affected users should have been allowed to intervene before their privacy became collateral damage.\n\nThe justification for the unprecedented preservation order was paper-thin. The Times argued that people who delete their ChatGPT conversations are more likely to have committed copyright infringement. And asStein put itin the hearing, it’s simple “logic” that “[i]f you think you’re doing something wrong, you’re going to want that to be deleted.”\n\nThis fundamentally misapprehends how people use generative AI. The idea that users are systematically stealing the Times’s intellectual property through ChatGPT, then cleverly covering their tracks, ignores the thousand legitimate reasons people delete chats. Users share intimate details about their lives with ChatGPT; of course they clear their conversations.\n\nThis precedent is terrifying. Now, Americans’ private data could be frozen when a corporate plaintiff simply claims — without proof — that Americans’ deleted content might add marginal value to their case. Today it’s ChatGPT. Tomorrow it could be your cleared browser history or your location data. All they need to do is argue that Americans who delete things must have something to hide.\n\nWe hope the Times will back away from its stunning position. This is the newspaper thatwon a Pulitzerfor exposing domestic wiretapping in the Bush era. The paper that built its brand in part by exposing mass surveillance. Yet here it is, demanding the biggest surveillance database in recorded history — a database that the National Security Agency could only dream of — all to win a copyright case. Now, in the next step of this litigation, the Times’s lawyers will start sifting through users’ private chats — all without users’ knowledge or consent.\n\nTo be clear, the question of whether OpenAI infringed the Times’s copyrights is for the courts to decide. But the resolution of that dispute should not cost 70 million Americans their privacy. What the Times calls “evidence,” millions of Americans call “secrets.”\n\nMaybe you have asked ChatGPT how to handle crippling debt. Maybe you have confessed why you can’t sleep at night. Maybe you’ve typed thoughts you’ve never said out loud. Delete should mean delete. The New York Times knows better — it just doesn’t care.\n\nJay Edelson has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s top 200 lawyers and by Fortune as one of the most creative people in business.

    "News_title":"How mournful fado music offers a window into Lisbon's soul",
    "News_text":"This article was produced byNational Geographic Traveller(UK).\n\nIt’s nearing midnight in Alfama,Lisbon’soldest neighbourhood, when a lady in black steps into a taverna.\n\nThe bar staff scurry to turn off the lights, leaving only the flickering tapers of candles to illuminate her angular features and fringed shawl, which she’s pulled tight around her shoulders. Elvira Giblott scans the room, as if reaching for a muse, then greets the two guitarists by the bar with the title of a song. In the restaurant, every fork is stilled, every wine glass untouched. She sings of Lisbon, of the beauty and struggle of life here, her voice filling the room before dropping to a velvety whisper. It’s as if her heart is breaking before our eyes.\n\nWhen, several songs later, the seasoned singer sweeps out of Tasca do Chico into the lamplit lane, it feels as if a spell has been broken — and something profound has been shared. In Alfama, the spiritual home of Lisbon’s folk fado music, such encounters can be sought out in tascas — unfussy taverns like the one I’m sat in, where rich stews and meat dishes are served — or more upmarket fado houses, where etiquette is more strictly upheld. “You should understand the difference between the establishments,” another performer, Joana Carvalhas, tells me when we get chatting at the end of her set. “There are places where you may be asked to leave for talking during a performance, where the music is just as serious as the food.”\n\nAt the start of her career, but with the resonant vocals of someone twice her age, Joana represents the next generation of fadistas (fado singers). “Of course, we now perform mainly for tourists, because we want to share fado and preserve it,” she explains, referring to the uptick in interest since UNESCO recognised the genre as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2011. “But at the end of the working night, us musicians still gather, at traditional places like Tasca do Chico or Mesa de Frades to play simply for the love of it.”\n\nIf the nights in Alfama are for fado, the days are for sightseeing. This is the Lisbon of postcards and daydreams, where cobblestone lanes are strung with colourful washing lines, vintage trams rattle around tight corners, and terraced miradouro (viewpoints) gaze out over a jumble of terracotta roofs and church towers towards the River Tagus. “It wasn’t always this popular,” walking tour guide Claudia Flores explains the next day in the shadow of the cathedral. “For centuries, before the gentrification of the last decade, Alfama was a working-class neighbourhood. It was here and in nearby Mouraria, the old Moorish Quarter, that fado — meaning fate — was born 200 years ago, although many trace its roots back much further.”\n\nCentral to fado music, and to the Portuguese psyche, are the ideas of saudade (melancholic longing) and the humbling hand of destiny. It was in 1755, as Lisbon rode high on the colonial riches ushered in during the Age of Discovery, that disaster struck. The most destructive earthquake in European history hit the capital, compounded by fires and a tsunami, levelling all but hilly Alfama with its firm volcanic bedrock. Reconstruction of the city centre was elegant, as anyone who tours the Pombaline monuments of Baixa-Chiado can attest, but emptied the national coffers, paving the way for the repressive Estado Novo regime of the 20th century.\n\n“‘Fado, football and Fatima’ were dictator António de Oliveira Salazar’s three Fs — a cynical credo designed to pacify and control the masses,” Claudia explains, as we arrive at an eye-catching mosaic, a portrait rising out of the calçada (patterned pavement), completed by artist Vhils in 2015. The figure is Amália Rodrigues, Portugal’s greatest fadista, who died in 1999 at age 79. She was the first woman to be interred in the National Pantheon. “I know her from the glamorous photos decorating the local tascas, framed large as if revering royalty or petitioning a saint,” she adds.\n\n“Fado could be subversive, voicing the everyday complaints of ordinary people, so the state moved to regulate singers and their new lyrics,” she explains. “Some bohemians took the genre underground.” But it was Amália Rodrigues who took it to stratospheric heights.\n\nTo better understand the evolution of fado, I’ve come to the arty warehouse regeneration complex of 8 Marvila, three miles up the coast from the city centre. Amid the area’s restaurants and pop-up boutiques, a state-of-the-art, permanent exhibition dedicated to Amália Rodrigues opened in 2024.\n\n“From a humble start in life, she elevated fado to a new dimension — she released 170 records and performed in more than 70 countries,” Louis Brézet from theAh, Amália: Living Experienceshow tells me by way of introduction. “The 20th century was a time when the Portuguese had few freedoms, especially women; when the country was seen as a backwater. Her life, and what she achieved, deserves this level of recognition.”\n\nThe eight galleries flow through large-scale projections, a virtual reality experience and an eye-catching mirrored room. Her poetry — which expanded fado’s established themes and elevated its use of metaphor — pepper the biographical exhibits along with previously unreleased recordings, all weaving together a portrait of a woman, a city and a sound. Even the traditional look of fadistas — the costume jewellery, the fringed shawl, the black dress that’s typically twisted and wrenched during emotional songs — is drawn from Amália’s own style. But while so much of her legacy lives on in today’s performers, it’s still astonishing to reach Ah, Amália’s theatrical finale: a full-size holographic performance by the singer at L’Olympia in Paris at the height of her vocal powers. No expense has been spared on the sound quality in the little theatre; my skin prickles with the raw ecstasy and palpable grief in her expression, as she soars through riffs and pulls phrases from her soul.\n\n“People think of Amália as a sad woman, always in black — but she was a wit with a flamboyant fashion sense,” tour guide Mariana Gonçalves says across town at the House Museum Amália Rodrigues, in the chichi São Bento neighbourhood, where the singer lived for the last 44 years of her life. Behind us, wardrobes burst with colourful, diaphanous gowns; around her bedroom, costume jewellery and handbags jostle for prominence with Catholic tchotchkes. “Faith, fate. Colour, darkness. The drama and contradictions of Amália’s life are a mirror to her time.”\n\nThis museum, run by theAmália Rodrigues Foundation, is a cosy counterpoint to the modernity of Ah, Amália, taking visitors behind the public image, into the time-warp salons where she threw extravagant bohemian parties, or to the sun-dappled back garden where, under the watchful gaze of Chico, Amália’s aged parrot, afternoon fado concerts are staged up to three times a week. My guide also is keen to stress that while Amália’s work was supported by the regime, the feeling was not mutual; quietly, she helped the poor and those in political exile.\n\nMotioning to a grand piano and a bulbous, 12-string fado guitar on display, Mariana says: “Amália never learned to play an instrument herself, but she had an incredible ear, singing in more than five languages. But it didn’t matter if foreign audiences could understand her. She always said: ‘Fado is meant to be felt, not explained.’”\n\nI return to Alfama over subsequent evenings, its fairytale quality only deepening as I roam its knotted lanes and discover — through chance findings and recommendations — much variety across its two dozen fado venues. Some restaurants, I learn, are too cavernous or touristy for my taste, their compulsory set menus a high price for entry. But others offer some of the most intimate and spellbinding evenings I’ve ever had in Lisbon — tiny A Baiuca, barely the size of a living room, where gutsy amateurs boldly debut; elegant Sala de Fado, newly opened in 2024, attracting legacy fadistas like Célia Leiria; and note-perfect Mesa de Frades, set in an 18th-century chapel adorned with historic azueljo tiles.\n\nAt the latter, I try for a seat late at night, after the last dinner service has been cleared and the audience is thinning out. Behind the tall, gnarled chapel doors, there’s an alchemy after midnight, as scheduled singers — like charismatic Flávia Pereira and velvet-voiced Matilde Sid, both eschewing the traditional black garb — start to share the floor with touring musicians.\n\nFrom the altar mezzanine, the acoustics are breathtaking, and there’s an untrammelled joy and spontaneity to proceedings that I would never have previously associated with the genre. I tap my feet along to upbeat songs — in particular the barnstorming Maria Lisboa, Uma Casa Portuguesa and Canto o Fado — chiming in for the refrains where invited by the performers. At others, like heart-rending Fado Português and Estranha Forma de Vida, I feel a slight prickling in my eyes, despite the language barrier.\n\n“It means a lot to me when I see someone feel the emotion of the song,” Flávia tells me at the end of the night. She’s one of Portugal’s newer artists, subtly adapting this musical genre to her own style. She says her influences are globally selling, modern fadistas such as Mariza, Carminho and Ana Moura — women marching in the footsteps of Amália Rodrigues. “It doesn’t matter where the audience is from,” she concludes. “Fado is in all our souls.”\n\nPublished in the European Cities Collection 2025 byNational Geographic Traveller(UK).To subscribe toNational Geographic Traveller(UK) magazine clickhere.

    "News_title":"Whoa—Scientists Found a Part of Human Cells We Never Knew Existed",
    "News_text":"\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nHemifusomes are fused vesicles, or sacs of fluid, that were previously unknown to exist inside cells.\n\nThey were discovered using cryo-electron tomography, which literally freezes them in time, and confirmed to be actual organelles and not just background noise.\n\nBecause hemifusomes collect and recycle junk proteins, they could mean more effective treatments for diseases caused and aggravated by protein plaque buildup, such as Alzheimer’s.\n\nBack in high school biology, most of us learned about the innards of a cell, or its organelles, from ribosomes to mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum, and probably had to identify them on our midterms. Now, an unexpected discovery will probably soon rewrite those textbooks.\n\nThe hemifusome is the new organelle that high school students (much to their chagrin) will have to remember. Biophysicist Seham Ebrahim of the University of Virginia and her team of researchers were observing mammalian cells when they discovered hemifusomes, which previously eluded detection because they are even smaller thanmitochondriaand can easily blur or be mistaken for background noise. These nano-orbs, which look like they have, noses bear an uncanny resemblance toBB-8or the profiles ofcertain Muppets. Pop culture references aside, their function of organizing, cleaning up, and recycling proteins could potentially unlock new treatments for genetic and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nHemifusomes consist of two vesicles, which are membrane sacs filled with liquid and formed byhemifusion, meaning that the smaller of the two is fused to the larger one like a hemisphere, almost as if its other half is missing. This occurs when the outer layers of two membranes merge first while the inner membrane layers stay open until a thin connection between themformsa new vesicle. The attached vesicles are sometimes found on the outside of the organelle and sometimes on the inside, and though where exactly these vesicles originate is still unknown, hemifusomes are thought to facilitate the formation of new vesicles that transport materials throughout the cell. This is probably how they take out cellular trash.\n\nEbrahim usedcryo-electron tomography, or cryo-ET, to observe and image hemifusomes. The cells, which were kept at cryogenic temperatures, were imaged in two dimensions using an electron microscope. Superfast cameras then took multiple photos of the frozen cells and their organelles. From these photos, single imageswere createdusing algorithms, upgrading the 2D images to 3D.\n\n“Our observation of hemifusomes in four different cell lines originating from various species and tissues and frozen as close as possible to their native state suggests that they may be common components of the cell periphery in a wide range of cells and tissues,” she said in a study recently published inNature Communications.\n\nSomething else the researchers wanted to explore was what kind of relationship hemifusomes had withendosomes, which are vesicles that transport extracellular material into the cell via the process of endocytosis. The cell’s plasma membrane will fold inward to surround matter, such as food molecules, in the surrounding fluid. These molecules are then taken in by the cell, whose plasma membrane pinches off to create an endosome that carries them into the cytoplasm. Endosomes can also form through the fusion of vesicles that already exist within the cell. Ebrahim traced the activity of endosomes and hemifusomes, but they did not appear to work together.\n\nWhat makes hemifusomes so important is how they collect and recycle junk proteins. Many studies have shown that thebuildup of protein plaquein the brain can cause and aggravate neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer’s, and more understanding about how these organelles operate could lead to the development of treatments that work with them.\n\n“Future research should focus on determining whether hemifusomes and compound hemifusomes are present in other cellular regions,” Ebrahimsaid, “and on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation, stability, and function, as well as their broader implications for cellular physiology and pathology.”\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "News_title":"A mosquito killer may lurk in a Mediterranean bacteria",
    "News_text":"Mosquito bitesare much more than just a red and itchy summertime nuisance. Thediseasesthat they carry are notoriously difficult to control andkill over 700,000 people worldwide every year. What’s more, manymosquitoeshave developed resistance to the synthetic insecticides–the same substances that can also pose environmental and health risks.\n\nAs a solution, microbiologists are looking intobiopesticidesderived from living organisms. According to astudy published July 7 in the journalApplied and Environmental Microbiology, a bacteria isolate collected from the Mediterranean island of Crete works as insecticides againstCulex pipiens molestusmosquitoes. Nicknamed the London Underground mosquito because they bitpeople sheltering in the city’s underground train stations during World War II, this species can transmit dangerous human pathogens, including West Nile Virus and Rift Valley Fever Virus.\n\nExtracts with these metabolites produced by three isolateskilled 100 percent of mosquito larvae within 24 hours of exposure. It’s those metabolites that could be used to develop biopesticides that have minimal ecological side effects, according to the team.\n\n“They degrade more quickly in the environment and therefore don’t accumulate, and they often don’t kill such a wide range of different insect species as chemical insecticides,”said George Dimopoulos, a study co-author and molecular entomologist and microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB) in Crete.\n\n[ Related:Mosquitoes can sense our body heat. ]\n\nIn microbiology, anisolateis a single species of bacteria that has been separated out from a mixed culture and also obtained from a pure culture. As a result, all of the bacteria in the culture are the same type. This makes it easier for biologists to study and identify that specific bacteria or bacterium.\n\nFor thisnew study,Dimopoulos and IMBB molecular biologist John Vontas collected 186 different samples from 65 locations across the island of Crete. The samples included topsoil,soilfrom around plant roots, plant tissues, water samples, and dead insects. Then, they exposedC. pipiens molestuslarvae to water solutions that had the most promising isolates found in the samples. Killing mosquito larvae before they grow into adult mosquitoes is acommon control methodsince the insects reproduce so quickly.\n\nMore than 100 of the isolates killed all of the mosquito larvae within a week and37 of those killed the larvae within three days. Those 37 isolates represented 20 genera of bacteria, many of which have not previously been identified for use in biopesticides, according to Dimopoulos.\n\nAdditional analysis revealed that the rapid-acting bacteria did not kill the larvae through infection. Instead it spurred the larvae to produce compounds like proteins andmetabolites–small molecules produced when an organism is breaking down food. This method is promising because it suggests that an insecticide using this bacteria would not depend on the microbes staying alive. Not being too dependent on living microbes could potentially make the biopesticides work longer. This method could have implications for controlling mosquitoes and potentially agricultural pests.\n\nThe team is also studying thechemical nature of the insecticidal moleculesmore closely and pinpointing whether they are proteins or metabolites. They’re also mapping out how much pesticidal activity the bacteria is capable of, including screening the isolates against other strains of pathogen-bearing mosquitoes and insects that threaten crops.\n\nSince biopesticides often degrade quickly and require multiple applications, finding the right way to formulate and deliver these compounds will be a challenge in the future.\n\n“It’s now entering the basic science phase to understand the molecules’ chemical structures and modes of action, and then we’ll shift to a more applied path, really aiming at prototype product development,” Dimopoulos said. “There is a major push toward developing ecologically friendly insecticides.”",

The “I” stands for “interstellar,” showing it came from beyond our solar system, and the “3” marks it as only the third type of this comet ever found.\n\nThe comet, first spotted on July 1 by the NASA-funded ATLAS survey telescope in Chile,is only the third known interstellar object ever observed passing through our neighborhood. It arrived from the direction of the star Sagittarius and is now cruising about 420 million miles away from Earth, the space agencyreportedearlier this month.\n\nDon’t worry, NASA says that is more than enough of asafe distance from the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nResearchers say 3I\/ATLAS poses no threat to our planet, whatsoever, regardless of its proximity and rare flight path. It will remain at least 150 million miles away at all times, comfortably farther than Mars’ distance from Earth.\n\nThe icy comet is scheduled to make its closest approach to the Sun onOctober 30, when it will pass just inside Mars’ orbit.\n\nIn a remarkable scientific twist, astronomers have since reviewed archives from three other ATLAS telescopes, uncovering images of the comet dating back to June 14. These “pre-discovery” images and observations are helping NASA and its researchers learn more about the rare comet’s trajectory and properties.\n\n3I\/ATLAS will stay visible to ground-based telescopes through September before it swings back behind the Sun. It’s also expected to “reappear” in early December, giving astronomers a second chance to observe this cosmic visitor before it drifts back into deep space.\n\nInterstellar comets like 3I\/ATLAS offer scientists a rare glimpse into materials from other star systems, potentially unlocking clues about how comets form in distant corners of our galaxy.\n\n“This is like our chance to randomly sample what’s going on in the rest of the galaxy,” University of Oxford astrophysicist Chris LintotttoldNPR. “I think the idea that we could see bits of other solar systems flying through our own really captivated the attention of a whole lot of people who started trying to work on these things.”",

Discovery-owned cable network.\n\nThe contract was unanimously ratified by the approximately 30-member bargaining unit.\n\nOne of the other areas of interest was the fact that the WGAE and Garden Slate Productions reached rehire protection language that the former calls “groundbreaking” as it addresses the issue of frequent short-term employment contracts. In practice, this means that it gives employees who worked the previous season first preference to return in following seasons and former employees who haven’t worked in two years can also request to be considered for open seasons and their past service will be considered.\n\nElsewhere, production assistants will receive a 2% increase to the minimum rates in years two and three of the contract, the company will make healthcare contributions on behalf of each employee per day worked, as well as a flexible benefits plan that allows unscripted workers to carry a health fund balance from gig to gig, even when unemployed or employed by a different employer, 12 paid holidays and up to five paid sick days annually as well as three paid bereavement days after four weeks worked.\n\nGarden Slate Productions becomes the latest unscripted production company to include WGAE members following the likes of A+E Factual Studios, ITV America, Jigsaw, Lion, Lucky 8, McGee Media, NBC News Service, RadicalMedia, Sharp, Story Syndicate and Vox Entertainment.\n\nThe Garden Slate Productions Bargaining committee said, “We’re so proud of our first contract, which among other wins for producers, art department and culinary workers, organized production assistants into the union and boosted their pay. The contract also establishes rehire protections for all members, which are sorely needed in a freelance industry. Our achievement is one part of a larger, industry-wide effort to win respect and sustainable conditions for the highly skilled and profitable work we all do.”\n\nThe company is run by Maggie Barnes and Brett Stolnick, who said in a statement that they are “pleased” to have reach an agreement with the “WGAE that reflects our long-standing commitment to providing leading wages and benefits, as well as a collegial and supportive work environment, to our valued employees”.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nEverything We Know About Christopher Nolan’s Next Film – ‘The Odyssey’: Release Date, Cast And More\n\n2025-26 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Tonys, Emmys, Oscars & More\n\n2025 TV Cancellations: Photo Gallery\n\nSign up forDeadline's Newsletter.

    "News_title":"Court documents say Keene woman suffered allergic reaction, died after eating pizza",
    "News_text":"The father of a Keene woman who died after eating pizza at a Massachusetts restaurant has taken the first steps toward suing the eatery, claiming his daughter’s pizza contained dairy products despite instructions to use dairy-free cheese due to a severe allergy.\n\nAttorneys for Eric Hedin of Alstead filed a complaint for discovery in Hampden Superior Court in Springfield, Mass., on June 27 against HighBrow Inc., which operates HighBrow Wood Fired Kitchen & Bar on Crafts Avenue in Northampton, Mass.\n\nA complaint for discovery is a legal move involving a party seeking information from another party prior to a formal lawsuit being filed, to help determine if a valid claim or complaint exists.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Hedin’s daughter, Kierstin “Kiki” Hedin, of Keene, went to HighBrow Wood Fired Kitchen and Bar at approximately 12:45 p.m. on Jan. 8, 2023, with three friends for lunch. Kierstin ordered a “Sticky Ribs” appetizer and, for her main course, ordered the “Braised Short Rib & Grilled Red Onion” pizza, specifically requesting it be prepared with “vegan\/lactose-free mozzarella,” court documents state.\n\n“Kierstin had a life-threatening and severe dairy allergy and had been under the care of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center since she was three years old,” the complaint reads.\n\n“Shortly after consuming the food, Kierstin began experiencing symptoms of an allergic reaction and went to the restroom,” the complaint says. “She subsequently suffered an anaphylactic reaction, resulting in a global hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.”\n\nHedin, 25, did not regain consciousness and died at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston on Jan. 13, 2023.\n\nThe pizza has been stored in a freezer at the Northampton Police Department since the day of the incident, labeled as “Hedin’s Food from HighBrow,” according to the complaint.\n\nPizza evidence\n\nThe police and Hampshire County District Attorney have indicated they will only release the pizza by agreement of the parties or by court order, the complaint says.\n\nAttempts to reach an attorney for HighBrow Inc. for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nThe complaint indicates attorneys for both sides have been exchanging information and conditions on where, when and how the pizza could be tested by experts to determine if dairy is present in the cheese used to make it.\n\nOn Dec. 16, 2024, Hedin’s attorneys proposed using Trelfa Labs, Inc. in Massachusetts, the only in-state facility equipped to conduct testing. The lab offered a qualitative test known as “AlerTox Sticks Total Milk,” which can detect the presence of milk proteins but not their quantity.\n\nOn Jan. 14, 2025, attorneys for HighBrow responded, requesting a different, more complex quantitative test — either “AlerTox ELISA Casein” or “AlerTox ELISA BLG” — if such tests were available.

    "News_title":"El Salvador Admits U.S. Has Custody of Migrants Trump Sent to Prison There",
    "News_text":"In the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s unlawful transfer of hundreds of migrants to a torture prison in El Salvador, theadministration claimedthat it had no legal authority to bring them back to the United States. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukeleclaimed, in turn,that he did not “have the power” to return wrongfully deported migrants, and wouldn’t even if he did.\n\nOn Monday, lawyers for the Venezuelan men fileddocumentsbefore District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., showing that the Salvadoran government told the United Nations that the U.S. retains ultimate authority over the men the Trump administration shipped to CECOT, the infamous mega-prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe documents directly undercut statements made publicly by top Trump administration officials. They also contradict statements made in the case before Boasberg, which involves the transfer of hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador, as well asin the caseinvolving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was illegally sent to prison in El Salvador despite a “protection from removal” order prohibiting him from being deported there.\n\nAccording toreportsfrom the United Nations Office Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances — which were submitted as evidence inJ.G.G. v. Trumpon Monday — the Salvadoran government claimed it had no authority over the individuals dumped in its prison system, and was only fulfilling an agreement with the Trump administration.\n\n“The actions of the state of El Salvador have been limited to the implementation of a bilateral cooperation mechanism with another state, through which it has facilitated the use of the Salvadoran prison infrastructure for the custody of persons detained within the scope of the justice system and law enforcement of that other state,” the Salvadoran government told the U.N. “In this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities, by virtue of international agreements signed and in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and international cooperation in criminal matters.”\n\nThe nation added, “In this regard, the actions attributable to the Salvadoran state are limited to its sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction, and therefore it cannot be held responsible for the failure to observe the principle of non-refoulement with respect to the persons mentioned.”\n\nThe Trump administrationhas refused to releaseits agreements with El Salvador to house migrants in its prisons, offering claims about how this information is “classified,” subject to attorney-client privilege, or even a state secret.\n\nThe lawyers for petitioners inJ.G.G.noted Monday that the U.S. government had been copied on these reports to the U.N., which transmitted in April, as part of several cases regarding claims of enforced or involuntary disappearances. They argued that the Trump Justice Department wrongfully failed to provide the documents as part of discovery before Boasberg’s court.\n\nAnd they pointed to the sworn deposition the Justice Department provided to the court in May, written under penalty of perjury, from State Department official Michael Kozak.\n\n“It was and remains my understanding that the detention and ultimate disposition of those detained in CECOT and other Salvadoran detention facilities are matters within the legal authority of El Salvador in accordance with its domestic and international legal obligations,” Kozak wrote in the filing.\n\nThe lawyers requested additional discovery in the case before Boasberg, noting “this new evidence contradicts the underlying custody conclusion in the Kozak declaration of May 9, 2025, which is dated after El Salvador’s responses to the U.N. and after petitioners sought habeas review.”\n\nThe topic of jurisdiction over the men whom Trump shipped to El Salvador came up again Monday in the Maryland case regarding Abrego Garcia’s unlawful deportation, whichthe Supreme Court foundto be“illegal.”\n\nAbrego Garcia wasreturned to the United Stateslast month so he could be indicted on new charges in Tennessee, after the Trump administration refused for weeks to comply with court orders mandating his return. Last week, attorneys for Abrego Garcia said he had beenphysically and psychologically torturedin El Salvador’s CECOT.\n\n“The detainees were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation,” a court filing said, adding that Abrego Garcia and other inmates had been beaten by guards and forced to kneel for hours on end while in the prison.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinisgrilled lawyersfor the Justice Department on their reasoning for previously claiming they had no authority over Abrego Garcia, only to level adubious criminal indictmentagainst him, and bring him back to the United States with the intent todeport himto a third country.\n\nThe Justice Department “secured an indictment against Mr. Abrego Garcia on May 21,” Xinis said. “How could you six days later say you had no power to produce him… why else would you file a criminal indictment against someone who you can’t produce?

    "News_title":"'Send them home': To promote tougher policies, report claims Spokane's homeless aren't from here",
    "News_text":"Jul. 7—Half of the homeless people in Spokane aren't from here and should be given bus tickets home, more strictly enforced by police and cut off from long-term services, according to a recent report released by the Spokane Business Association, a prominent political advocacy group funded by businessman Larry Stone.\n\nA week after the report's release, the association proposed an amendment to the city's charter, which if approved by voters would reshape the city's homelessness laws and force Spokane to shift funding away from affordable housing, firefighting equipment and other priorities to fund emergency shelters, more visible police patrols and other policies recommended in the report.\n\nCritics in City Hall have dismissed the report as unscientific, unhelpful and politically motivated ahead of the November elections, when several seats currently or recently occupied by progressives are being challenged by candidates more in line with the Spokane Business Association's policy goals.\n\nBut the report's author and the organization sponsoring the survey argue the data is concrete proof that Spokane's homelessness policies not only are ineffective at helping people get off the streets, they're attracting people from elsewhere who are drawn to the city by lax law enforcement.\n\nJust over 50% of the roughly 230 homeless people surveyed for the association said they moved to the city after becoming homeless.\n\nThis contradicts the federally mandated \"point-in-time\" counts, annual standardized surveys that try to reach every homeless person living on the streets or in a shelter. The point-in-time counts have their own flaws, as the authors of Spokane County's 2024 report readily acknowledged. But of the 2,021 people surveyed in last year's point-in-time count, roughly 80% said they lived in Spokane County before becoming homeless.\n\nRobert Marbut, President Donald Trump's \"homeless czar\" from 2019 to 2021 and the consultant contracted to conduct the survey, argues his data is more accurate because he also asked where people were born, went to high school and whether they have family in Spokane.\n\nIt is not clear why these additional questions would sway the data by 30 points, but Marbut's recommendations for dealing with this influx are clearer, and consistent with the \"Velvet Hammer\" approach he has pitched cities across the country for at least a decade: Spokane has to get tougher with the homeless, pressuring them into treatment or departure.\n\nGavin Cooley, an executive of the Spokane Business Association, argued Marbut's expertise lent the report more authority than it lost from a lack of cited sources, and dismissed as \"deeply political\" a recent article from Range Media that turned to an expert in homeless research to pick apart the report's methodology and conclusions.\n\nCooley believes the media and politicians are overly focused on attacking the data and not paying enough attention to the conclusions Marbut reaches with that data.\n\n\"You can certainly note the deficiencies as you see them ... but I think it'd be a pity to miss the higher level order of what's being recommended,\" Cooley said.\n\nEvery effort should be made to send people back where they came from, particularly if they've been in Spokane for less than 90 days, according to the report. Those who stay should be cut off from long-term services, which should be reserved only for those with longstanding ties to Spokane. For those who are from Spokane, the report recommends mandatory treatment services in order to receive housing, which city officials claim would violate state and federal law.\n\nMarbut has spoken out for at least a decade against policies he believes are \"enabling\" the homeless with \"goodies,\" including Housing First policies that have been the national standard since 2013, in which homeless people are given stable housing upfront to enable them to then address addiction, mental health and social reintegration.\n\nAttempts to relocate the homeless en masse are even older. The phrase \"Greyhound therapy\" has been used to describe the practice since the 1970s and has been criticized by researchers for just as long for redistributing the social costs of homelessness rather than improving them. Many of America's largest cities have, at one point or another, attempted similar policies; between 2011 and 2017, the Guardian tracked over 20,000 homeless people given bus tickets out of and sometimes between 16 U.S. cities.\n\nProponents, including the Spokane Business Association, argue that such programs reconnect people to families and friends and can lead to a long-term improvement in their situation.\n\nSpokane's homeless service providers have engaged in the practice for years, however.\n\nIf a homeless person requests a bus ticket, and a friend or family member declares they can take them in, they will be provided a ticket. Julie Garcia, who runs the homeless services organization Jewels Helping Hands, which manages several of the city's homeless shelters, estimated her organization hands out around 250 tickets a year.\n\nThere appears to be little academic research into whether these programs lead to long-term reductions of homelessness or just move it elsewhere. The Guardian reported that, of the thousands being bused from San Francisco through the Homeward Bound program between 2010 and 2015, the city had records of following up with only three people after they reached their destinations.\n\nBut the Spokane Business Association report goes further to suggest that the city should cut off people who decline these tickets from long-term homeless services and even emergency shelters after 21 days.\n\nWhile much of the study copies nearly verbatim a similar report on King County that Marbut was commissioned to write for the Discovery Institute, Marbut claims that Spokane is unusual in one regard: Homeless people aren't coming to Spokane for its quality services, but for its lax enforcement.\n\n\"What we got on the street was generally, they treat me nice here, they don't hassle me,\" Marbut said.\n\n\"It wasn't that they came here because of the services — many communities I go to, it's, 'Oh, they have great services' — but here it was, 'They sort of let me be.' \"\n\nThis picture notably doesn't match what many homeless people on Spokane's streets have told The Spokesman-Review in recent years, who described being pushed from place to place throughout the day by law enforcement, security guards and business owners.\n\n\"We literally don't get to sit down like this,\" said Amber, a 32-year-old homeless woman interviewed under an overpass in August. \"We are moving constantly. ... So many people have cracked feet and heels.\"\n\nCooley dismissed this type of enforcement as an \"occasional blow of the horn,\" and wants to see tougher laws and stricter enforcement — not because he wants them to go to jail, which he says would be ineffective and expensive — but to force people to change their lives.\n\nCooley acknowledged that Washington's involuntary treatment laws are not extensive enough to force a homeless person into drug or mental health treatment.\n\nInstead, he argued, the city should use its tougher homelessness laws to offer them a choice: either go to jail, or enter \"voluntary\" treatment.\n\nOr they could leave, Cooley noted.\n\n\"If you find that a great number of people have no connection to Spokane at all, and you suddenly begin to say you cannot use fentanyl in this community unfettered ... how many of those folks will stick around?\" Cooley asked.\n\nIn an interview, Mayor Lisa Brown dismissed the report as misinformed, arguing many of the report's claims about the city's policies were untrue and some of its recommendations were already standard practice.\n\n\"I believe this is really about the political campaigns in November,\" Brown said, noting Stone's longstanding funding of candidates opposing progressive policies and production of high-dollar videos to encourage tougher homelessness policies.\n\n\"I also believe that, with the resources they are apparently able to mobilize, it would be great if, as a show of good faith, they put them into an actual solution, rather than a propaganda campaign against the city and the majority on the city council,\" Brown added.\n\nBut Cooley believes the evidence was clear, regardless of the survey's findings, that what the city is doing is failing to have a significant impact on the city's visible homeless population or its soaring overdose deaths.\n\n\"I know Seattle really damn well, and I can't believe the rapid turnaround as it relates to enforcement,\" Cooley said. \"And what I don't know is where those people are ... but I know they've made a visible turn in on-street homelessness.\"\n\nThe report has started to leak into the broader public conversation on Spokane's homelessness policies. Wendy Fishburne, vice president of the East Spokane Business Association, appeared to quote parts of it verbatim Monday before the Spokane City Council voted to reform its homelessness laws.\n\n\"Research shows that people do better recovering from addiction when they're surrounded by their families of origin,\" Fishburne said. \"Find out where people actually come from and compassionately send them home ... so that our resources could be used for our folks.\"",

    "News_title":"Defamation suit offers early test of Ohio’s new anti-SLAPP statute",
    "News_text":"Stock photo from Getty Images.\n\nIn Cambridge, Ohio attorneys have filed what may be the state’s first anti-SLAPP motion. The newly established legal procedure gives defendants a tool to dismiss frivolous lawsuits filed suppress their protected speech.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Free Speech,38 stateshave now passed laws protecting against strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP.\n\nThe lawsuit concerns a divorced couple. The ex-wife, Maegin George, works as a nurse while the ex-husband, Jonathan George, is president of Conn’s Potato Chips.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nJonathan George filed a defamation suit alleging that after he began a new relationship, Maegin George falsely accused him of pedophilia, incest, and attempting to pay for sex.\n\nMaegin George argues she has not said many of the things her ex-husband claims, and what she has said is not defamatory and protected by the First Amendment.\n\nShe’s asking the court to conduct an anti-SLAPP review and dismiss the case.\n\nState lawmakers approved Ohio’s anti-SLAPP statute,Senate Bill 237, in the final days of the last legislative session. In both chambers, the measure passed without a single ‘no’ vote.\n\nThe bill’s co-sponsors, state Sens. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville, and Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, explained SLAPP suits can take several different forms, including defamation or nuisance lawsuits. What holds them together, though, is their aim — to “silence or intimidate an individual for exercising their rights to free speech.”\n\n“Such lawsuits,” Gavarone explained in committee, “send a message to potential critics that those who speak out will face stress, time commitments, and expensive legal bills over a period of months or even years that many defendants cannot endure.”\n\nThe proposal had the backing of a wide array of interest groups, from the ACLU and news organizations to domestic violence groups and the state bar. Ohio’s measure adopts language drafted by the Uniform Law Commission, a non-partisan group of lawyers, judges and professors who develop draft legislation that states can adopt.\n\nThe law establishes a fast-track review process, where defendants can argue the lawsuit is frivolous or related to their protected speech. Filing that motion halts other proceedings like discovery, which limits costs and so-called fishing expedition tactics. Both parties have opportunities to appeal along the way, but if the judge determines the lawsuit is meant to stifle speech, it gets dismissed.\n\nThe engine driving SLAPP suits, ACLU chief lobbyist Gary Daniels explained, is a power or financial imbalance between the two parties.\n\n“A well-known scenario is grassroots activists speaking out about environmental, safety, or other concerns only to be sued or countersued for their advocacy,” Daniels said. The person filing a SLAPP suit against them doesn’t care if they win or lose in court. “Instead, they know the massive costs of litigation and legal defense act as a barrier against those without adequate financial resources to fight back and defend themselves.”\n\nMonica Nieporte from the Ohio News Media Association explained news outlets are a frequent target of the SLAPP playbook.\n\n“Newspapers in Ohio have been sued for defamation simply for running an article, editorial, or even a political cartoon,” she told state lawmakers. “The goal of these suits is not to prevail and receive damages, but to stifle and suppress protected expression.”\n\nMore troubling, Bridget Mahoney explained, without anti-SLAPP legislation on the books, abusers can turn the court system against their victims. Mahoney is the former board chair of the Ohio Domestic Violence Network. Divorcing her abusive ex-husband started a 20-year court battle. When Mahoney and her daughter began advocating for other survivors, Mahoney’s ex-husband filed a defamation case. She described depositions and discovery stretching on for years, forcing her to relive some of her worst experiences and costing her more than $100,000.\n\n“Anyone in Ohio who comes forward to tell their story or report a sexual assault are vulnerable to the same debilitating frivolous lawsuit that we endured,” Mahoney said. She stressed that the law wouldn’t limit her ex-husband or anyone else’s right to sue. “What it will do is give us and others like us a tool so that we are safer to exercise our freedom of speech.”\n\nMaegin George sees something similar in the case Jonathan George filed against her. She filed sworn statements from the people referenced in ex-husband’s complaint stating she never alleged he “committed any sexual misconduct, incest, or pedophilia.” She acknowledged telling one individual that he was friends with a minor on Snapchat but made no accusation of incest.\n\nShe goes on to argue her “communications, to the extent they occurred, addressed issues of public concern — particularly the safety and propriety of Mr. George’s interactions with minors — and thus are shielded by the First Amendment.”\n\nThat point is key to the new anti-SLAPP case analysis. The process plays out in three steps. First, the judge must determine if the allegations arise from protected speech. Next, the court has to weigh whether those initial allegations are legitimate on their face. Finally, the judge considers if the underlying case is legally viable.\n\nIn short, the process asks the court to take a long hard look at what’s being alleged before submitting both parties to a potentially arduous and costly ordeal.\n\nMaegin George’s attorney Austin Warehime argues the case against her is often vague and poorly supported by the evidence.\n\n“Ohio finally has a powerful shield for everyday people who speak out,” he argued, noting the case is one of the first anti-SLAPP motions in the state. “We’re asking the court to apply that shield exactly as the legislature intended — swiftly and decisively.”\n\nSam Shamansky, the attorney representing Jonathan George dismissed those claims out of hand.\n\n“The notion that our client is trying to suppress protected free speech is literally nonsensical,” he said.\n\nShamansky called the contention that George is a public figure because he heads up a prominent local business “utter bulls—.”\n\n“Does that mean anybody that owns a business is a public figure? It’s absurd,” he said, adding they’re looking forward to their day in court.\n\nFollow Ohio Capital Journal Reporter Nick Evanson Xoron Bluesky.\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "News_title":"Ancient Menominee grew tropical corn farther north than expected, surprising researchers",
    "News_text":"In a stunning discovery — both in agricultural sophistication and geographic location —researchers have foundancestors of the Menominee Nation of Wisconsin were growing tropical corn in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula about 1,000 years ago.\n\nLast monthDartmouth researchers discoveredthe most complete ancient agricultural site so far in the eastern half of the U.S., along the Menominee River just across the Wisconsin border.\n\nResearcherssaid the Sixty Islands archaeological site features a raised ridge field system, with a more extensive maize, or corn, system than anyone imagined. It is a tropical plant, and many Western researchers previously believed it was mostly grown in tropical to subtropical regions. They were astounded that Menominee could grow so much in a cold climate with a relatively short growing season.\n\n“The scale of this agricultural system by ancestral Menominee communities is 10 times larger than what was previously estimated,” said lead author Madeleine McLeester, an assistant professor of anthropology at Dartmouth, in a published article. “That forces us to reconsider a number of preconceived ideas we have about agriculture not only in the region, but globally.”\n\nBeans and squash also were grown at the site, completing the “Three Sisters” farming system created by Indigenous peoples. The crops work together naturally to protect each other from pests and disease.\n\n“When you look at the scale of farming, this would require the kind of labor organization that is typically associated with a much larger, state-level hierarchical society,” said McLeester in the Dartmouth article. “Yet, everything we know about this area suggests smaller egalitarian societies lived in this region. But, in fact, this may have been a rather large settlement.”\n\nThe site is part of what’s known to Menominee as Anaem Omot, translated to “Dog’s Belly,” and is where Menominee believe they were created near the mouth of the Menominee River at least 10,000 years ago.\n\nAlong with raised ancient agricultural fields, the site also contains burial mounds, hammered metal artifacts, unmarked graves, ancient medicine lodges and dance rings associated with the Menominee Dream Dance.\n\nIt remains a place of spiritual pilgrimage for Menominee living in Wisconsin.\n\nFor years, the Menominee Nation has fought against mining at the site. Canada-based Aquila Resources had hoped to start its Back 40 Mine, which would extract gold, silver, zinc and copper. Aquila Resources was acquired in 2021 by Gold Resource Corporation.\n\nThe Menominee has argued it would harm the environment, in particular affecting the region's water, which is historically significant to the tribe.\n\nWith the help of Menominee Tribal Historic Preservation Officer David Grignon and the late archaeologist David Overstreet, the tribe was able to convince Western authorities to place the site on the National Register of Historic Places in 2023. The designation creates an extra layer of protection from harmful development.\n\n“It was a long time in coming, but now our sacred sites, mounds and historic sites on the Menominee River at Sixty Islands are recognized,” Grignon said.\n\nStefanie Tsosie, an attorney with Earthjustice, which has helped the tribe, said the historic designation is the same kind found in many cities usually represented by plaques on historic buildings.\n\n“It doesn’t outright prevent development,” she said. “It’s just an extra layer of regulation or extra layer of consideration that needs to happen.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:Menominee grew tropical corn farther in U.P., stunning researchers",

    "News_text":"This story was originally published onBioPharma Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free dailyBioPharma Dive newsletter.\n\nFor decades now, scientists have been experimenting with a new way to target and destroy proteins linked to disease. Unlike most approved drugs, which work by turning cell signaling up or down like a dimmer switch, this approach aims to rid cells of problem proteins entirely.\n\nTargeted protein degradation, as it’s broadly known, could open the door to attacking proteins that remain frustratingly out of reach of traditional drugmaking technology. It may also be a more efficient way to shut down known disease targets.\n\nEarlier this year, the field got its best look yet at how well one common type of these drugs performs. Biotechnology company Arvinas said a medicine itadvanced with Pfizersucceeded in a large breast cancer study. The finding marked the first time this kind of drug had made it through Phase 3 clinical testing.\n\nArvinas and Pfizer were met with more skepticism than praise, however. Their drug, calledvepdegestrant, proved only modestly beneficial for some patients and no more helpful for others than an existing mainstay. It doesn’t appear clearly betterthan other medicines, either, leaving its potential uncertain.\n\nStill, there is growing momentum in the degrader field. Since Arvinas’ findings, another company, Kymera Therapeutics, showed that aprotein-destroying medicine it developedmay be able to stifle a drug target others have struggled to reach. Multiple deals have been struck by large companies such as Roche and Novartis, suggesting pharmaceutical firms believe degraders have only begun to show their promise.\n\nAs a drugmaking science, targeted protein degradation has maturedsince 2001, when scientists Craig Crews, Ray Deshaies and others published a foundational paper on one type of protein-degrading molecule, dubbed proteolysis-targeting chimera, or PROTAC. Since then, more than two dozen biotechs have launched in the field, developing new ways tojunk troublesome proteinsthat carry arcane names like LYTACs, DUBTACs and molecular glues. Several have drugs in or near clinical testing.\n\n“The next five years will see many degraders approved with potential huge impact for patients,” predicted Nello Mainolfi, CEO of Kymera.\n\n“Drug discovery is a risky and costly endeavor,” said Angela Cacace, Arvinas’ chief scientific officer. “Our modality has the potential to transform the way we treat diseases, including horrible, lethal diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration.”\n\nThe body’s cells are typically adept at processing the detritus of their normal functioning. Using specialized disposal systems known as the proteasome and lysosome, they can break down damaged proteins and worn-out parts, preventing the toxic build-up of waste.\n\nOne of the main ways they do this is via a miniscule tag called ubiquitin. A ubiquitin tag marks cellular trash as such, spurring the cell to dispose of it.\n\nBut the cell doesn’t always recognize which proteins are harmful to it. Scientists have spent decades trying to figure out how to coax the process along and direct it toward proteins known to be associated with disease.\n\nThe result of their research is what’s now described as targeted protein degradation, which conceptually is a bit like ordering a junk hauling service for the cell. Specially designed small molecule drugs can bring together target proteins with an enzyme that tags them with ubiquitin, thereby marking them for destruction.\n\nIn their 2001 paper, Crews, Deshaies and others described how synthetic molecules could attach ubiquitins to unwanted cell parts. This approach drew attention as a way to go after proteins that typically can’t be bound by traditional drugs, which lock onto “pockets” amid the jumble of a protein’s amino acids. Later, in the 2010s,scientists realizedthat several blood cancer drugs made by Celgene worked via protein degradation.\n\n\"It was serendipitous as a discovery,\" said Nathanael Gray, a Stanford University professor who studies targeted protein degradation. The success of Celgene’s drugs, he added, “catalyzed the business and clinical interest” in the drugmaking approach.\n\nSmall molecule degraders generally consist of three parts: one component designed to bind to protein targets; a so-called E3 ligase recruiter, which attracts the enzyme responsible for tagging the problematic protein or cell part; and a linker.\n\n“The beauty of PROTACs is that, for the first time, you could actually hijack the cell's natural ubiquitin-proteasome machinery and target specific targets,” said Cacace.\n\nFor years, researchers struggled to develop an effective method for directing the E3 ligase. But the discovery in the mid-2010s of somesubtypes of ligands, and how they were expressedacross cell typesgave companies like Arvinas, C4 and Kymera better means to develop degrader drugs.\n\nCacace, of Arvinas, said those discoveries were “key pieces” that helped companies “bridge to greater tools” and led to oral drug-like molecules. \"It really did give us this leap forward,\" Cacace said.\n\nFrom there, the industry has invented several variations of the broader concept. Since Crews launched Arvinas in 2013, various biotechs have set out with their own spins on the idea, chasing different degrader pathways to the lysosome or proteasome.\n\nMost focus on PROTACs or “molecular glues,” which are in development at companies such asMonte Rosa TherapeuticsandNeomorph. They’resmallerthan their PROTAC cousins, by not requiring a linker, but can be harder to design and optimize. Glues can be used, for instance, to introduce or restore communication between pathways that prompt cell death, which tumor cells have typically adapted themselves to avoid.\n\n“You sort of create a Frankenstein situation,” Gray said, of molecular glues.\n\nMolecular glues offer companies a means to tap into a broader concept called induced proximity, where the goal is similarly to draw two proteins together, but potentially for purposes other than degradation.MagnetBiomedicine, which recently struck a deal with Eli Lilly, aims to use molecular glues to spark cooperative protein-protein interactions.\n\nAnd some, likeVicinitas Therapeutics, are developing deubiquitinase-targeting chimeras, or DUBTACs. While a PROTAC works by putting labels on harmful proteins that need to be trashed, DUBTACs remove those tags to save helpful proteins. The latter approach is useful if, for instance, researchers want toprotect tumor-suppressing proteins.\n\nOne of targeted protein degradation’s main draws is the path it offers to reach “undruggable” targets.\n\nAn estimated85% of human proteinscan’t be effectively targeted by typical small molecule drugs. And intracellular proteins, protected by the cell’s membrane, can’t be readily reached by biologic medicines like antibodies.\n\nSmall molecule degraders expand the universe of targets, as they don’t need to latch onto proteins in the ways that conventional drugs do.\n\nKymera’s oral degrader KT-621, which targets STAT6, is a good example. STAT6 is aimed at a transcription factor related to two cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, that are important to immune cell function. Medicines hitting those receptors generate billions of dollars in annual sales for their makers. Dupixent, which blocks IL-4, alone brought in more than $4 billion in sales for Sanofi in thefirst quarter of 2025.\n\nWith KT-621, Kymera hopes to reach earlier in the process andbetter attackthe underlying roots of disease. The idea of going in the cell with an oral drug has always been the holy grail for any disease, and especially in immunology, where these are chronic therapies,” Mainolfi said.\n\nProtein degraders also hold potential to more efficiently knock out targets that already can be drugged. Arvinas’ vepdegestrant, for instance, works by tagging estrogen receptors for decay, reducing how much they are expressed in people with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.\n\nArvinas had hoped its drug would broadly outperform fulvestrant, an older type of drug known as a selective estrogen receptor degrader, or SERD. It positioned vepdegestrant as an alternative that doesn't require injections with fewer side effects. But mixed results in testing could cloud that particular drug’s future.\n\nAndrew Hirsch, CEO of C4 Therapeutics, also notes how degraders could hold advantages because of the specificity they can achieve by co-opting ligases to recognize target proteins. With drugs that work by binding to their target — either reversibly or covalently — there are “still some off-target effects that you have,” he said.\n\nOf all the companies that have launched since the beginning of the last decade, the most advanced is Arvinas, which has with Pfizerfiled an applicationfor approval of vepdegestrant in people with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and mutations in the ESR1 gene.\n\nThough it may not be used across a broader patient population, results from Arvinas and Pfizer’s trial of vepdegestrant offer some validation for degraders’ potential. The company is looking at another clinical prospect in B-cell lymphoma, as well as other programs in cancer and neurological disorders.\n\nFollowing closely behind are Kymera and companies like Nurix Therapeutics. Kymera, which hopes to make oral drugs with biologic-like efficacy, releaseddata for KT-621 in June, which showed treatment was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers. KT-621 completely degraded STAT6 in all participants who received multiple doses — \"important validation for the target,\" according to Leerink Partners analyst Faisal Khurshid.\n\nSTAT6 is related to two popular drug targets, IL-4 and IL-13. Medicines hitting those receptors generate billions of dollars in annual sales for their makers; Dupixent alone brought in more than $4 billion in sales for Sanofi in thefirst quarter of 2025. “The idea of going in the cell with an oral drug has always been the holy grail for any disease, and especially in immunology, where these are chronic therapies,” Mainolfi said.\n\nAlso in the clinic are biotechs likeBiohaven, which has a small molecule it’s developing to degrade IgG antibodies; Monte Rosa, which has three programs in Phase 1 testing for immune diseases and cancers, and C4, which is testing its treatment in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nOther targeted protein degradation companies are trying out new degrader technologies, among themNurix TherapeuticsandOrum Therapeutics. Both are developing treatments that draw on the idea of antibody-drug conjugates, but swap out the chemotherapy toxin for a protein degrader.\n\nPharma has struck up more than a dozen collaborations across the field. Roche has invested multiple times in molecular glue and degrader candidates, extending deals to C4, Monte Rosa Therapeutics and Orionis Biosciences.\n\nThough those collaborations are “years away” from hitting the market, Roche sees “high potential” in pursuing those targets, said Boris Zaïtra, the head of corporate business development at Roche, inan interview earlier this year.\n\nOrionis launched with a collaboration already in place with Novartis, which has partnered with Monte Rosa and Arvinas, too.

    "News_text":"Who knew penguin poop could be so good for the environment? Researchers are finding that the ammonia released from these adorable waddlers can help form clouds to combat rising temperatures, reportedABC News.\n\nAccording to the researchers, when ammonia from penguin poop mixes with ocean gases, it helps create tiny particles that water can stick to. This increases moisture in the air, aiding cloud formation. Extra cloud coverage lowers surface temperatures, which can ease heatwaves, reduce energy demand and costs for cooling homes, and decrease sea ice melt, a growing problem in the Arctic.\n\n\"They have a synergistic role for the formation of particles in the atmosphere,\" Matthew Boyer, a researcher at the University of Helsinki's Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research,explainedto ABC News.\n\nIt's not the first time experts have identified penguins as environmental helpers.\n\nAside from being incredibly fun to watch, penguins act as both predators and prey in their arctic habitats, balancing the food chain naturally. They alsotransport land nutrients to the sea, and vice versa, to support biodiversity in both ecosystems.\n\nInterestingly, the very thing penguins can help control — the changing climate — is also one of their biggest threats.\n\nRising temperatures lead to melting ice in the Arctic environments where penguins live and breed. Sea ice is crucial for penguins, as they use it to form breeding colonies and nests and as a platform for hunting food.\n\nAccording toBirdLife, about half of all penguin species are listed as vulnerable or endangered. Onestudyeven predicted that emperor penguins could be extinct by 2100. Protecting penguin habitats can allow populations to thrive and continue playing their natural role in keeping ecosystems healthy.\n\nThe researchers tracking the benefits of penguin poop hope that their discovery can lead to other positive environmental changes around the world, particularly surrounding global temperatures.\n\n\"Understanding what's happening locallyin Antarctica ... allows us to predict how things could change in the future for other regions of the planet too,\" Boyersaid.\n\nDo you think America has a plastic waste problem?\n\nDefinitely\n\nOnly in some areas\n\nNot really\n\nI'm not sure\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nJoin ourfree newsletterforgood newsanduseful tips, and don't missthis cool listof easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "News_text":"Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn archaeological team in Egypt’s Aga Khan Mausoleum area discovered a buried Greco-Roman tomb at the bottom of a stone staircase.\n\nLocated on the Nile’s west bank in Aswan, the rock-cut tombs contain well-preserved hieroglyphic inscriptions.\n\nAn impressive six-foot-tall limestone coffin also contained multiple mummified remains.\n\nNine steps down a stone staircase in Egypt’s Aga Khan Mausoleum, archaeologists discovered a host of hieroglyphic inscriptions among what they call “one of the most architecturally impressive and well-preserved tombs unearthed to date.”\n\nTucked away more than six feet underground, the tomb includes a roughly six-foot-tall limestonesarcophagusatop a rock-carved platform, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in astatement. Vertical columns of hieroglyphic text run the length of the sarcophagus, and include prayers to local deities alongside a record stating that the tomb’s owner, Ka-Mesiu, was a high-ranking official.\n\nA joint Egyptian-Italian archaeological mission—led by the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Milan—uncovered several rock-cut tombs from the Greco-Roman period. Tomb No. 38 was the crown jewel of the discoveries, and included a nine-step staircase surrounded by mudbrick benches that were likely meant to house funerary offerings.\n\nThe sarcophagus in the heart of the tomb included an anthropoid lid with a “finely detailed human face adorned with a decorative wig and remarkable painted features.” The tomb also contained severalmummies, including those of children.\n\nThe find provides “new insights into the social dynamics of the region during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods” and reinforces Aswan’s historic status as a major cultural center in southern Egypt, H.E. Sherif Fathy, ministry of tourism and antiquities, said in a statement. “These tombs not only reflect the greatness of the Pharaonic civilization but also its capacity for adaption and continuity under new administrations, such as those of the Ptolemies and the Romans,” he continued.\n\nMohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, added that the discovery reveals clear evidence of the necropolis’ continued funerary use by various social classes over a significant amount of time. The elite were buried in tombs atop the plateau, while the middle class we buries along the slopes near the Aga Khan Mausoleum in Aswan.\n\nKhaled said the mummies will undergo CT scans and biological analyses to attempt to discover their identities, health conditions, and causes of death. The team will also investigate thehieroglyphicinscriptions and artifacts in the hopes of gaining further insight into the funerary traditions and religious symbolism of the later periods of ancient Egyptian history.\n\nTomb No. 38 could be just one of many discoveries to come at the site. Mohamed Abdel-Badei, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the hill’s plateau hosts a series of large underground tombs dating to the Ptolemaic period that were once meant for elite families before later being reused during the Roman era.

    "News_title":"Astronomers discover ‘fossil galaxy’ 3 billion light-years away",
    "News_text":"A galaxy that has remained unchanged for 7 billion years — a rarity in the universe — has been observed by astronomers, offering a glimpse into cosmic history and adding to an enigmatic collection of objects called relics or “fossil galaxies.”\n\nThese space oddities are galaxies that, after an initial phase of intense star formation, escape their expected evolutionary path. While other galaxies expand and merge with one another, the fossil galaxies remain virtually inactive. Like celestial time capsules, they provide a snapshot into the ancient universe and allow astronomers to examine the mechanism of galaxy formation.\n\nThe newly discovered fossil galaxy — named KiDS J0842+0059 — is about3 billion light-yearsfrom Earth, making it both the most distant and the first of its kind observed outside the local universe, the region of space closest to Earth that is approximately 1 billion light-years in radius. It was found by a team of astronomers led by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), using high-resolution imaging from the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona.\n\n“Relic galaxies, just by chance, did not merge with any other galaxy, remaining more or less intact through time,” said Crescenzo Tortora, a researcher at INAF and first author of a study on the findingpublishedMay 31 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. “These objects are very rare because, as time goes on, the probability to merge with another galaxy naturally increases.”\n\nAstronomers believe that the most massive galaxies form in two phases, according to study coauthor Chiara Spiniello, a researcher at the University of Oxford in the UK.\n\n“First, there’s an early burst of star formation, a very quick and violent activity,” she said. “We end up having something very compact and small, the progenitor of this relic.”\n\nThe second phase, she added, is a protracted process during which galaxies that are in close proximity start interacting, merging and eating each other, causing a very dramatic change in their shapes, sizes and star populations. “We define a relic as an object that missed almost completely this second phase, having formed at least 75% of its mass in the first phase,” Spiniello explained.\n\nThe telltale feature of fossil galaxies is that they are very old, compact and dense, much more so than our own galaxy.\n\n“They contain (billions) of stars as massive as the sun and they are not forming any new stars — they’re doing essentially nothing, and they are the fossil records of the very ancient universe,” she said. “They formed when the universe was really, really young. And then, for some reasons that we honestly don’t understand yet, they did not interact. They didn’t merge with other systems. They evolved undisturbed, and they remained as they were.”\n\nFossil galaxies are crucial because they are a direct link to the massive galaxy population that existed billions of years ago, said Michele Cappellari, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford who was not involved with the study. “As ‘living fossils,’ they have avoided the chaotic mergers and growth that most other massive galaxies have experienced. Studying them allows us to reconstruct the conditions of the universe in its infancy and understand the initial bursts of star formation,” he said.\n\nWhat caused these galaxies to stop forming stars so abruptly is a major question, he added. “Evidence from both local and (distant) observations suggests that feedback from supermassive black holes may be responsible,” Cappellari said. “These black holes can produce powerful winds that expel or heat the gas in a galaxy, preventing further star formation. However, this remains an active area of research.”\n\nScientists initially identified KiDS J0842+0059 in 2018 using theVLT Survey Telescope(VST) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. That observation revealed that the galaxy was populated by very old stars but only provided an estimate of its mass and size, so a more detailed observation was required to confirm it was a relic. The Large Binocular Telescope used for this confirmation can render very sharp images due to its ability to compensate for atmospheric turbulence, which otherwise can make it difficult for Earth-based telescopes to focus on distant objects.\n\nThe newly found fossil galaxy joins a group of only a handful of others that have been observed at the same level of detail, the most pristine of which — called NGC 1277 — wasconfirmedby the Hubble Space Telescope in 2018.\n\nNGC 1277 and KiDS J0842+0059 are very similar, but the latter is much farther away from Earth. It fits the definition of fossil galaxy almost perfectly, according to Spiniello.\n\n“This is what we call an extreme relic,” she said, “because almost all, or 99.5% of its stars were formed incredibly early on in cosmic time, and the galaxy did absolutely nothing thereafter.”\n\nThe fossil galaxy has stars and planets, just like our own galaxy, but it is much more dense, Spiniello added. “There will be many more stars in a tiny, tiny volume, so it’ll be super crowded,” she said. “And it will be much harder to find solar systems like ours, with many planets orbiting around it, just because of the chances of getting companion stars interfering nearby.”\n\nKiDS J0842+0059 looks to observers like it did 3 billion years ago, because that’s how long it takes for the light coming from the galaxy to reach Earth. Spiniello hypothesized that the relic will likely remain as it is forever, but scientists can’t be certain since they still don’t know what keeps it from interacting with other galaxies.\n\n“There must be something that prevents them from merging, but without knowing what, we cannot really predict what’s going to happen in the future,” Spiniello said.\n\nIt is very hard to identify fossil galaxies and confirm their nature, partly because they’re relatively rare and small compared with regular galaxies such as the Milky Way, according to Sébastien Comerón, an extragalactic astronomer at the Universidad de La Laguna and the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Spain. The confirmation of a distant relic galaxy is a credit to the search strategies used to identify these objects and of modern instruments, he said.\n\n“Relic galaxies are mysterious,” added Comerón, who was not involved with the study, in an email. “The fact that a few galaxies are nowadays untouched relics of the first large galaxies needs an explanation.”\n\nAstronomers can’t say for certain how rare relics are, but Spiniello estimates there might be “one in millions” among all the galaxies in the universe. TheINSPIREproject — which aims to find and catalogue fossil galaxies and spawned the discovery of KiDS J0842+0059 — has already identified several dozen other candidates that are in the pipeline for further scrutiny, Spiniello said.\n\nNew instruments could make this search even more effective. Both Spiniello and Tortora are excited about Euclid, a European Space Agency telescope launched in 2023 with the goal ofexploring dark matterand dark energy that will also be useful for observing fossil galaxies.\n\n“Euclid will be transformational,” Spiniello said, “because rather than observing one single object at a time, its wide sky survey configuration will cover a lot more. The idea is to find all the galaxies in a patch of sky, and then isolate all the ones that are ultra compact. And if you do that, then you can actually estimate how rare (fossil galaxies) are.”\n\nConfirming relic galaxy KiDS J0842+0059 at such a distance is a remarkable achievement, and the future of this field is very promising, Cappellari said in an email. “With powerful new telescopes like James Webb and Euclid (which produced its first images just a few months ago), and on the ground with advanced adaptive optics, we can expect to find and study more of these relics at even greater distances.”\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Slain Morgan Hill teen Marissa DiNapoli was stabbed in back: police",
    "News_text":"SAN JOSE, Calif. (KRON) — Marissa DiNapoli’s accused killer hid behind his defense attorney Tuesday afternoon at the Hall of Justice in San Jose. Martin Mendoza is charged with murdering 18-year-old DiNapoli in Morgan Hill. As he declined to enter a plea, Mendoza stood in a courtroom doorway just out of view from a large group of DiNapoli’s family and friends, who were sitting in the gallery.\n\nInvestigators believe that the murder weapon was a knife, Morgan Hill Police Department Detective Kyle Tolentino wrote in a police report. “Marissa was found with five stab wounds to her back” near Anderson Lake, Tolentino wrote.\n\n“It was a lethal and brutal attack. She was then just left there,” District Attorney Jeff Rosen said.\n\nThe victim’s friends described Mendoza, 20, as a possessive and violent boyfriend. One friend, Vienna Chambers, said DiNapoli was in love with Mendoza, and she warned DiNapoli to stay away from him. Leading up to her death, the teenager was in the process of breaking up with her boyfriend, Chambers told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\n“If she was in the car with him, and he wanted to see her phone, he would try to break a window. Two years ago I told her, ‘he’s going to kill you.’ (For) two years I tried to tell her, ‘he’s going to kill you.’ I told her father that she was still seeing him,” Chambers said.\n\nDiNapoli was first reported to police as missing on June 30, when DiNapoli’s father and sister went to the police station. On June 28, DiNapoli texted her father telling him that she was staying at a friend’s house and she would return home on June 29 at 8 p.m., Tolentino wrote.\n\nThe detective wrote, “Marissa never returned home, and was not responding to any text messages or phone calls from family members” on June 30. DiNapoli worked as a barista at a Starbucks coffee shop, but she never showed up for her shift, the police report states.\n\nMendoza was with DiNapoli when she was last seen alive on June 29, police said. That morning, home surveillance camera recorded them together at Mendoza’s residence on Trail Drive in Morgan Hill.\n\nIn the surveillance video, DiNapoli and Mendoza both appear to be upset. “Marissa and Martin were seen on internal surveillance video. Marissa and Martin were walking down the stairs together while Martin was confronting her about contacting her ex-boyfriend. Marissa’s facial expression was visibly apprehensive,” Tolentino wrote.\n\nAfter the teenager disappeared, Mendoza refused to cooperate with police, MHPD said. He also refused to talk to her family when they demanded to know where she was, the police report states.\n\nTo raise awareness that DiNapoli was missing, her sisterposted a copy of the surveillance videoon Instagram.\n\nFollowing a missing person search,her remains were discovered at Anderson Lake County Parkin the Woodchoppers Flat Picnic Area on July 2. The lifeless teenager was still wearing the same clothing that she was wearing in the June 29 surveillance video, according to the police report. Detective Tolentino also recognized DiNapoli’s black necklace with a cross.\n\n“Witness interviews and forensic evidence support our conclusion that Martin Mendoza Jr. stabbed and killed Marissa DiNapoli,” Tolentino wrote.\n\nLast week, FBI agents, officers with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. border control agents teamed up with Morgan Hill police to find DiNapoli’s killer.\n\nOn July 1, Mendoza had his cellphone with him as he drove his car across the U.S.-Mexico border, according to prosecutors. Traffic cameras recorded his car traveling into Mexico at the San Ysidro border crossing, the police report states.\n\nMendoza later re-entered the U.S. by walking on foot, without his car and cellphone, Rosen told reporters. He was captured and arrested Sunday by United States Marshals in El Centro, California.\n\nWithin the past 48 hours, Mendoza transported from a jail near the border to San Jose to face charges. A Santa Clara County judge ordered the defendant to remain in custody without bail. He is scheduled to return to court for an arraignment on September 9.\n\nDiNapoli’s friends described Mendoza’s courtroom behavior as cowardly. “I saw his face and he hid behind the doorway, and hid behind his lawyer. I think he’s scared because we have so much on him to pin him,” Chambers told reporters.\n\nDiNapoli’s sister held up a poster with the message “Long Live Marissa. Forever 18.”\n\nIf Mendoza is found guilty of first-degree murder, he could face 26 years to life in prison, District Attorney Rosen said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_text":"The government of El Salvador has formally asserted it is the U.S., not the Central American nation, that retains “legal responsibility” for Venezuelans held in a Salvadoran megaprison, contracting Trump administration claims.\n\nThe disclosure was made to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and submitted in court filings by those challenging President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to send some 200 Venezuelan men to be held in the country’s most notorious prison.\n\n“The jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities, by virtue of international agreements signed and in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and international cooperation in criminal matters,” El Salvador said, referring to the U.S.\n\nThe comments are at odds with statements given by White House and Department of Justice officials, who have claimed they cannot seek the return of the men, as they are now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.\n\n“El Salvador has confirmed what we and everyone else understood: it is the United States that controls what happens to the Venezuelans languishing at CECOT. Remarkably the U.S. government didn’t provide this information to us or the court,” American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer Lee Gelernt, who is representing some of the men, said in an email.\n\nThe filing from the ACLU seeks to order additional discovery in the case and argues the Trump administration violated its obligation to share information about its arrangement with El Savlador.\n\nIn an April meeting in the White House with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, President Trump said it was up to the Salvadoran leader whether to release a man who was the subject of another case — mistakenly deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nAnd in court, the Trump administration has argued it was powerless in any effort to secure the return of the men, saying they were beyond the reach of the U.S. legal system and that their fate rests with El Salvador.\n\nThe Trump administration in mid-March deported Venezuelans to the infamous CECOT prison, known by its acronym in Spanish, as well as some Salvadorans.\n\nA Justice Department whistleblower has accused Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove of suggesting the department may need to defy court orders grounding flights set to deport men under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe Trump administration has agreed to pay El Salvador $15 million to imprison the men, according to Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who shared the figure after traveling to El Salvador to meet with government officials as well as Abrego Garcia.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_text":"BOARDMAN, Ohio(WKBN) — There was a scary discovery inside a Boardman home after a woman found a bullet in her living room.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a peaceful Fourth of July evening became scary after abullet came through the roofof a home on Orlo Lane in Boardman. The homeowner didn’t want to go on camera, but she told First News she was shocked to find not only the bullet, but she found it right next to where she usually watches TV.\n\nThe homeowner immediately called her neighbor, Mitchell Angelo, for help.\n\n“She called me in a panic, saying a bullet came through the ceiling in her sunroom and it bounced across the floor,” Angelo said. I came over and looked, she had the bullet, and I went up on the roof and saw the bullet hole.”\n\nAfter noticing the damage, Angelo had his neighbor call 911 to file a police report.\n\n“When she calls me, I come help,” he said. “That’s why I try to be a good neighbor.”\n\nAngelo got on the roof and took photos to show how much damage one stray bullet can do.\n\n“The bullet came through — there’s a hole in the metal, in the insulation and through the ceiling,” he said.\n\nThe homeowner wasn’t hurt, as she went to bed before the bullet struck through the house, but between fireworks and gunshots, it was hard to make out the difference.\n\n“I did hear gunshots and whatnot, but it’s hard to tell what was what,” she said on the 911 call.\n\nAngelo patched the hole himself, but he says this situation is a reminder that celebrations should not come at theexpense of safety.\n\n“You want to have fun, do it. But again, be safe about it. Just use common sense,” he said. “There’s consequences for all actions. Just think about that before you do something like this, please.”\n\nAccording to the Boardman Police incident report, investigators believe the bullet traveled northeast to the home.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) – After nearly five years of fighting to keep her job as a trooper with the Michigan State Police, Megan Moryc was fired – for the second time – on Feb. 13 for allegedly lying under oath during a divorce hearing in 2018. She says she is the victim of gender discrimination and has filed suit. MSP says the agency is protecting its employees from an abusive woman.\n\nMoryc, 40, had faced examination by her superiors, prosecutors, judges, arbiters and appellate judges – from administrative hearings to the Michigan Supreme Court – and one thing has been crystal clear: No matter what was decided, MSP officials wanted to withdraw her appointment as a trooper and send her back to civilian life.\n\n‘Big Boys’ Club’: Discontent in the Michigan State Police\n\nAll of this is playing out as unions representing troopers and commanders for the MSP haveoverwhelmingly voted “no confidence”in the leadership of the MSP’s top brass, Col. James F. Grady and his second-in-command, Lt. Col. Aimee Brimacomb. Both unions have called for their resignations.\n\nThe head of the Michigan Republican Party and current state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) joined the unions in calling for the leaders’ resignations. He’s also called for criminal investigations into Brimacombe related to accusations she used a 2015 black Buick Regal issued by the state for her work for personal travel.\n\nThe office of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a statement supporting Grady, whom she appointed to the post, and his second-in-command.\n\nIn the middle of all of that is the case involving Moryc, whose firing in February followed an administrative hearing on Jan. 7 that was just the latest confrontation in her battle with MSP.\n\nSince August 2024, the 6 News Investigates Team has been examining this battle between Moryc and the MSP, reviewing hundreds of pages of internal investigations, court filings, court opinions, emails and prosecutorial communications. This has included audio and transcripts, surveillance videos and on-camera interviews with Moryc.\n\nThose interviews and documents obtained through Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act, commonly referred to as FOIA, and previous court filings came before March 25, when a judge in Eaton County Circuit Court issued an order preventing Moryc – or anyone in the case –  from releasing anything obtained from discovery or during depositions of her ongoing Michigan Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act lawsuit against the agency.\n\nOfficials for the state of Michigan have declined to respond to detailed questions from the 6 News Investigates Team for months, but for the next several days, you will read and view what 6 News Investigates has learned from this labyrinth of allegations, investigations, criminal cases and internal actions and inactions by MSP.\n\nYou will learn about Moryc’s fight for a career at a sexualized “big boys’ club” at the Lakeview Post of the Michigan State Police.\n\nMSP leadership first fired Moryc, a trooper since 2016, in 2021 after she accepted a plea deal to assault charges following a drunken incident with fellow troopers during a union gathering. She served 21 days in the Grand Traverse County Jail and then was fired on internal charges related to alleged sexual assaults in the incident, charges an arbitrator could not determine to be accurate, charges that were dropped as part of the plea deal.\n\nIn February 2022, the arbitrator ordered Moryc to be reinstated. Her termination was downgraded to 6 months of unpaid suspension, and the state was on the hook for back pay to June 1, 2021.\n\nArb Decision MSP & MSPTA – Megan Moryc discharge[7091]Download\n\nThrough attorneys at the office of the Michigan Attorney General, MSP challenged that ruling, which was overturned by a local judge, reinstated by the Michigan Court of Appeals and then upheld when the state Supreme Court declined to hear new arguments.\n\nMSP leadership withheld her back pay until May 22, 2025, and the Michigan Department of Treasury confirmed that she received a check from MSP. “The check description reads ‘MAKE WHOLE SETTLEMENT,’” treasury spokesman Ron Liex wrote in an email to 6 News Investigates.\n\nLiex was unable to confirm the amount of the check, but 6 News has learned it was for tens of thousands of dollars less than what Moryc ought to have been paid from June 1, 2021, until Oct. 2, 2025, when she returned to the state payroll.\n\nDeducted from her back pay were payments for premiums for health insurance she didn’t have while the case worked through the courts and MSP did not employ her. In addition, the check deducted annual pay she received from another job she took while the case wound through the legal system.\n\nAn assistant attorney general argued in December 2024 that Moryc could not be fully restored to duty, nor should the state have to pay her the totality of her back pay, because her law enforcement license had lapsed during the years-long appeals process.\n\nWhen required to restore Moryc to duty, MSP immediately placed her on paid suspension while the agency investigated her for allegedly lying during a court hearing. That investigation soon came to an end.\n\nThis past Dec. 20,  MSP investigators declared she had lied under oath and recommended her immediate termination, and on Jan. 7, she again stood before command staff in Grand Rapids for a disciplinary hearing to address that recommendation.\n\nThe charge emerged from her testimony during the divorce of former Trooper Trevin Saxon Antcliff, Moryc’s supervisor-turned-friend-turned-sex-partner-turned-dating partner-turned-lover, a man who MSP confirms resigned while facing felony perjury charges for the same case and separate misdemeanor domestic violence charges.\n\nAntcliff’s resignation in January 2024 had allowed him to keep his nearly 20-year pension, despite the pending criminal cases and having faced disciplinary action, in part, for having sexually harassed Moryc, an admission that is part of her civil rights lawsuit against the department.\n\nGiven all those issues, this is what, in part, Moryc told the disciplinary hearing on Jan. 7:\n\n“The fact is, we are here for two reasons today. First, the men who have investigated this case appear to be incapable of providing a woman sexual agency. … I. DID. NOT. LIE. … Second, this department had constructive notice that Trooper Trevin Antcliff served as a danger to every woman he came in contact with. … The department is perusing [sic] this alleged perjury not because it believes a crime was committed but because it is attempting to mitigate its’ [sic] liabilities and to undermine my character and integrity. Let the facts stand as they are.”\n\nWith-all-due-respectDownload\n\nAfter Moryc’s statement, officials adjourned, they said, to consider the allegations more thoroughly. Then on Feb. 13, Moryc was called before the administrative hearing team again. This time, there were no statements from her. She was terminated.\n\nDozens of emails and phone calls to county prosecutors, troopers and command staff identified in the reports have gone unreturned or referred to others. MSP spokesperson Shanon Banner has issued only blanket statements, avoiding answering specific questions:\n\n“The Michigan State Police has a long-standing tradition of demanding the highest possible standards of professional conduct from its enlisted and civilian members. All allegations of misconduct are aggressively investigated. Oversight of the investigation process is the responsibility of the Professional Standards Section. Independent of whether a criminal charge results in a conviction, the employee may still be subject to administrative actions if the investigation reveals a violation of department policy. Policy violations are investigated thoroughly and acted upon in a manner consistent with labor law and collective bargaining agreements.”\n\nEmailed statement from Shanon Banner, communications director, Michigan State Police\n\nThe office of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also declined to discuss specifics regarding the years-long legal battle to keep Moryc from the job.\n\n“The Department of Attorney General’s only involvement in the matters you have identified is representing the Michigan State Police in two cases, MSP v MSPTA regarding a prior arbitration with a trooper, and Moryc v MSP, an employment case brought by the same trooper against MSP,” spokesperson Danny Wimmer wrote in response to questions from 6 News. “As both matters are currently pending in court, we cannot comment at this time. And since our office is serving as legal counsel to MSP any discussions or advice related to those cases are attorney-client privileged communications, and cannot be discussed.”\n\nEmail statement from Danny Wimmer, spokesperson for the Department of Attorney General.\n\nNeither MSP nor the Office of the Attorney General has explained how this lengthy legal war has benefited taxpayers, who are footing the bills.\n\nComplaint-1st-Amended-SIGNEDDownload\n\nMoryc sued MSP in Eaton County Circuit Court, alleging violations of the state’s anti-discrimination law – the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. While allegations of retaliation against her, such as the perjury investigation, continue as a part of her lawsuit, earlier allegations, including sexual harassment, have been barred by the court because too much time has elapsed between when the alleged discrimination occurred and when the complaint reached the court.\n\nMoryc v MSP register of actionsDownload\n\nMoryc had an unblemished record as a trooper stationed at the Lakeview Post from her hiring in 2016 until October 2020, when she was accused of physically and sexually assaulting fellow troopers during a drunken roughhousing session at a union event in Traverse City.\n\nThe above video is a compilation of snippets from about 15 minutes of surveillance video from a resort in Grand Traverse County, Oct. 13, 2024. Moryc can be seen in the light orange-colored shirt in the video. All 15 minutes of surveillance video were used by MSP commander staff to justify Moryc’s termination in 2021 and during an arbitration hearing. 6 News Investigates will release all of the video from that case in a future report in this ongoing series.\n\nMoryc was charged with two counts of assault and battery and two counts of criminal sexual conduct, 4thdegree and ultimately entered a “no contest” plea to the two counts of assault and battery, misdemeanors that allowed her to continue a career in law enforcement. A “no contest” plea is distinct from pleading guilty; pleading no contest means a defendant accepts conviction but does not admit guilt.\n\nMoryc District Court Register of ActionsDownload\n\nBut 86-2 District Court Judge Robert Cooney discarded her agreement with prosecutors, sending her to jail for 30 days, 21 of which she served. She was fired from her job and became lost in what she calls “purgatory,” leaving her with a criminal record and mired in a legal battle for reinstatement.\n\nLetter from Thomas Deasy regarding service in jailDownload\n\nJust days before Moryc was scheduled for release from the jail, MSP officials showed up, MSP folders, and served Moryc with notice of an administrative interview, to be held while she was an inmate.  The service of the administrative interview effectively identified her as a law enforcement agent, she argued, and put her health and safety at risk. The interview was delayed until she was out of jail and ultimately led to the administrative hearing in which she was discharged in the summer of 2021.\n\nAfter an arbitrator in February 2022 ordered the MSP to reinstate Moryc with back pay – ruling the activities in Traverse City didn’t rise to the level requiring termination from employment –  MSP leaders, represented by the attorney general’s office, appealed. MSP argued the arbitrator had exceeded her authority in the arbitration decision, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge James. Jamo agreed.\n\nIn that appeal by MSP, Jamo overturned the arbitration award, but his judgment was reversed on Dec. 28, 2023, in apublished unanimous opinionby a 3-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals. A published ruling by the Court of Appeals applies statewide unless it is overturned by the Michigan Supreme Court.\n\nMorycc Court of Appeals DecisionDownload\n\n“Moreover, unlike the CBA [collective bargaining agreement] at issue inLenawee Co, nothing in the CBA here provides that an employee charged with or convicted of a crime is subject to mandatory termination, nor does it indicate that the arbitrator did not have the authority to reduce the grievant’s punishment from termination to an unpaid suspension,” the judges opined.\n\nMichigan Supreme Court order in MorycDownload\n\nAnd the lawyers for the attorney general did appeal again to the Michigan Supreme Court, which on Sept. 18, 2024, declined to hear the case, thus upholding the reinstatement. MSP put Moyrc back on state payroll on Oct. 2, but – “before the ink was dry” on her human resources paperwork, she said – she was placed on paid administrative leave but ordered to be available Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nMotion for Entry of Order to Enforce Arbitration AwardDownload\n\nWhile the internal investigation into whether or not Moryc lied under oath plowed forward, lawyers from the state and her union were battling in court over the original arbitration decision from February 2022.\n\nIn a hearing on Dec. 18 in Ingham County Circuit Court, again before Judge Jamo, Assistant Attorney General Mary Waddell argued that Moryc was back on the State of Michigan payroll – and had been since Oct. 2 – but she couldn’t be rehired as a trooper.\n\nJamo-order-2024-enfore-arbitration-awardDownload\n\n“She cannot legally be reinstated to an MSP trooper position because she lost her MCOLES (Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards) certification,” Wardell told Jamo, citing the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards, the licensing agent for law enforcement in Michigan.\n\nTimothy Dlugos, an attorney representing the Michigan State Police Trooper Association, the union for MSP troopers, argued on Moryc’s behalf.\n\n“Her MCOLES license only lapsed because of the dilatory action of having to go through the appeal process here,” Dlugos told Jamo. “It lapses after two years of inactivity. At the time she was ordered back to work by the arbitrator, her MCOLES license hadn’t lapsed.”\n\nMoryc’s capacity to renew her license with MCOLES remained unclear as the MSP investigated allegations of perjury. To date, she has not seen her license renewed, and with an administrative finding that she lied, it may be impossible for her to renew that license.\n\nIf she does, she will find herself on a “Brady Giglio list” of law enforcement agents accused of being untruthful. That list is made available to defense attorneys, allowing defendants to impeach the credibility of a law enforcement agent during trial.\n\nMoryc’s alleged perjury stemmed from whether she lied under oath on Oct. 9, 2018, during the divorce proceeding in Montcalm County between Antcliff and his second wife, Nina. At issue: Were Antcliff and Moryc in a romantic relationship, and was she honest in her testimony?\n\nThen-trooper Antcliff had been assigned as Moryc’s field training officer for the final two-thirds of her on-the-job training in 2016-17. She informed MSP investigators that a sexual relationship between them began while she was his trainee, and the sexual activity would later develop into a romantic relationship that ultimately collapsed.\n\nIn early 2024, attorneys from the Newaygo County Prosecutor’s Office had declined to bring criminal charges against Moryc for that alleged perjury, saying those charges were “unlikely to meet the burden of proof at trial.” Similarly, though, Newaygo County Prosecutor Rachel Robinson was prepared to issue felony charges for perjury against Antcliff for his testimony in the same hearing.\n\nNewaygo-County-FOIA-Antcliff-1Download\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Barbara McQuade says she’s not surprised that formal criminal charges on perjury had not been filed.\n\n“Perjury cases are very challenging because you must prove that the person knowingly made a statement that was false. Misleading statements are not sufficient. Omissions are not sufficient,” McQuade wrote in an email to the 6 News Investigates Team. “In addition, the false statement must be material to the testimony. That is, it must have been important to the outcome of the case.”\n\nDespite that philosophical consideration and the absence of new evidence from that criminal investigation, MSP Professional Standards Section investigator Special Lt. Christopher Tuckey concluded Moryc had committed perjury. Moryc was notified of the decision on Dec. 20.\n\nThe Professional Standards Section is the agency’s internal affairs investigation department, which handles both criminal investigations against troopers and alleged policy violations by troopers.\n\nThe notice about her hearing on Jan. 7 claims Tuckey’s investigation “established that you violated department policy, and the law, when you perjured yourself while testifying, under oath, in a divorce proceeding of your (then) boyfriend when called by his attorney as a witness in defense of his alleged infidelity with you in 2017.”\n\nSexual harassment Antcliff finalDownload\n\nMSP rules allow the agency to discipline troopers for alleged crimes, even if prosecution does not occur.\n\nTranscripts from the divorce proceeding on Oct. 9, 2018, reveal that Moryc was never asked if she was having a sexual relationship with then-Trooper Antcliff. Attorneys only asked when the two began dating romantically.\n\nIn her final divorce order and opinion, dating Oct. 29, 2018, 20 days after the alleged perjury, Montcalm County Circuit Court Judge Suzanne Hoseth wrote, “Again, this Court recognizes that when working closely with another individual, particularly in life-or-death situations where they are called to protect the public and each other, it is not uncommon for the boundaries to blur between a professional relationship and something more.”\n\nShe does not conclude in her opinion that either trooper lied on the stand during testimony before her. The first document below was given to 6 News by Moyrc, and any handwriting or annotations on it were made by her.\n\nJudgement of Divorce and OpinionDownload\n\n2018 divorce transcriptsDownload\n\nMoryc vehemently denies that at the time of the incident she was questioned about during testimony, she was in a “romantic” or “dating” relationship with Antcliff.\n\n“He [Antcliff] was like my best friend because I was secluded from all my friends, any support system. I had no support system there, I didn’t,” Moryc told the 6 News Investigates Team.\n\n“He started pursuing more of the physical. Would want to come over after work. Bring alcohol and want to, you know, stay up and drink and have a good time. And then this physical relationship formed.”\n\nMoryc, who was married at the time to Christopher Lee Symonds, says Antcliff’s advances made her uncomfortable. “I never wanted to cheat on my husband. I never,” she says. “I wasn’t comfortable. I told him I wasn’t comfortable.”\n\nMSP investigators said Moryc’s explanation was a “fabricated interpretation of the meaning of ‘relationship,’ as it related to your involvement with your (then) boyfriend, was material in the court testimony and weaponized by you to defend your integrity during administrative investigation.”\n\nAs Moryc’s second field training officer, Antcliff had the authority and responsibility to report on her training and progress. His assessments could have resulted in her losing her position with MSP because she was still on probationary status. That eventually led to disciplinary action pending against him when Antcliff resigned and walked away with his pension.\n\nMoryc told investigators his make-or-break assessments of her performance were “in the back of my mind.”\n\nWendy Murphy, a professor at New England Law in Boston and leader of the Women and Children’s Advocacy Project at the school, said the situation described is illegal under civil rights laws.\n\n“Quid pro quo sexual harassment doesn’t involve a question of wantedness,” she says. “It’s per se improper.”\n\nShe said the threat of ending the career of a subordinate is “inherent in the relationship.”\n\nFor its part, MSP commanders determined Sept. 26, 2023, in an administrative charging document, that Antcliff had committed sexual harassment.\n\n“After review of the attached PSS Investigation, there are several Official Order violations to include Sexual Harassment (Quid Pro Quo), impairing the efficiency of the agency, and the below code of conduct,” the charging document reveals.\n\nTuckey’s investigation revealed command staff had concerns about placing Moryc with Antcliff for training because he was a “womanizer” and had a “negative reputation with women.” The decision to place her under his supervision was made because she was married at the time.\n\n“We felt that we can’t consider what are essentially rumors and conjecture in how we do our assignments,” Lt. Rob Davis told investigators about assigning Moryc to Antcliff and concerns about his “womanizing.”\n\nMuch of what Davis told investigators was summarized in the subsequent investigative report. The quotes come directly from the audio interview.\n\nDavis went on to share that during one meeting where placement of Moryc was considered, another command staff member referred to the situation as “putting a wolf in the hen house or something like that.”\n\nAs Moryc completed her training phases and became a full road officer, her sexual relationship with Antcliff continued. She says she’s not sure exactly when that relationship shifted from best friends who had sex to a “dating” relationship.\n\n“We never really defined lines,” she said. “I would say the most defining point in this relationship that started out as, you know, we were best friends, was, you know, in late like December 2017 – when I was divorced and we were looking at getting a house together. Before then, we hadn’t really because we were best friends, and I don’t really know how to define it.”\n\nThe 2023 investigation of Antcliff concluded he had engaged in a sexual relationship with Moryc while he was her field training officer.\n\n“During the principal interview with Trooper Antcliff, he admitted engaging in [a] sexual relationship with Trooper Moryc beginning approximately two weeks after she started FTO with him,” the report concludes.\n\nWhen Moryc was called in again and fired on Feb. 13, union officials filed an arbitration notice on her behalf. On April 14, a hearing was held before an arbitrator. Post-hearing legal briefs were required to be filed with the arbitrator by the end of business on June 3. Those records are not yet available.\n\nThe arbitrator is expected to release a ruling in 30 to 60 days from June 3.\n\nMoryc’s suit in Eaton County Circuit Court, alleging she has been discriminated against by MSP because of her gender and alleging she has been illegally retaliated against by the agency for reporting that discrimination, continues.\n\nA Michigan Department of Civil Rights investigation into those allegations was dismissed by the agency after Moryc filed suit, a spokesperson for the MDCR told the 6 News Investigates team.\n\nMDCR #643570_RedactedDownload\n\nMSP’s only response to her claims was Banner’s blanket statement. The state attorney general’s office also offered a similar response about its limited involvement.\n\n“The Department of Attorney General’s only involvement in the matters you have identified is representing the Michigan State Police in two cases, MSP v MSPTA regarding a prior arbitration with a trooper, and Moryc v MSP, an employment case brought by the same trooper against MSP,” spokesperson Danny Wimmer wrote in response to questions from 6 News, including how this case benefitted the taxpayers of the state of Michigan. “As both matters are currently pending in court, we cannot comment at this time. And since our office is serving as legal counsel to MSP any discussions or advice related to those cases are attorney-client privileged communications, and cannot be discussed.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic or sexual violence, there is help.\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or your local law enforcement agency.\n\nFor support related to domestic violence, call:  1-800-799-7233\n\nFor support related to sexual assault, call: 800.656.HOPE (4673)\n\n6 News Digital ProducersShajaka Shelton,Trevor Kingand 6 News Digital Content ManagerDuncan Phenixcontributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A Mexican court on Tuesday sentenced 10 men to 141-year prison terms each for their involvement in aranch in the western Mexican state of Jaliscothat was used by a feared cartel to recruit members, kill and disappear victims.\n\nThediscovery earlier this year of the Izaguirre ranch, used by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel for recruitment and training since 2021, had sparked alarm and fear across the region.\n\nThe 10 men were arrested in September 2024 during an initial raid on the property. They were convicted on Monday in the disappearance and murder of three victims. On Tuesday, each was sentenced to 141 years and three months in prison, and ordered to pay 1.3 million pesos (about $65,000) in restitution to the victims' families, the local prosecutor's office said.\n\nFive other suspects detained in the case are still awaiting trial, including three municipal police officers, a CJNG operative who allegedly recruited new members, and José Murguía Santiago, the mayor of Teuchitlan, the municipality where the ranch is located.\n\nMurguía Santiago was arrested just days after Mexico’s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero revealed that since 2021, the Jalisco state Human Rights Commission had alerted Teuchitlan authorities about the ranch being operated by CJNG, but the warning was ignored for years.\n\nThe case had sparked a major controversy after Guerrero Buscadores de Jalisco — a group that searches for missing persons — reported in March 5 the discovery of numerous charred human bones and hundreds of clothing items and shoes at the site.\n\nThe shock brought back into the spotlight stark violence and rampant impunity in cartel-plagued parts of the Latin American nation and the tragedy of theinvestigations into Mexico's 130,000 missing people.\n\nFollowing that report, it emerged that Jalisco’s state prosecutors had not moved forward with the investigation for several months after the initial raid on the ranch, when the National Guard intervened and arrested the 10 men. During that operation, one body and two of the men later detained were found on the ranch.\n\nDue to missteps and omissions by state authorities, the federal Attorney General’s Office took over the case — but criticism persisted.\n\nAt the end of April, Gertz Manero dismissed claims that cremation sites existed at “Rancho Izaguirre,” fueling backlash from activists. The group Guerreros Buscadores de Jalisco responded, saying it had recovered “17 sets of charred human bone remains” from the site, which are now in the custody of forensics teams.\n\n____\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean athttps:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/latin-america",

    "News_text":"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — As more time passes since the deadly flash flooding hit Texas, more central Ohioans are joining the efforts to help relief efforts, including some with close ties to the state.\n\n“I bleed Texas through and through,” said Akil Steele, owner of the central Ohio barbecue company Texas Steele BBQ.\n\nOhio equal rights amendment would outlaw discrimination, void same-sex marriage ban\n\nIt’s easy to tell Texas means a lot to him. The name of the state is in his company’s name and it’s where he grew up.\n\n“I always think of Texas, every time I’m cooking, I’m thinking of Texas,” Steele said.\n\nThe state he spent about half his life in his now hurting. Steele’s relatives in Texas don’t live in the areas hardest hit by the flash flooding, but he said they’ve still gotten lots of rain, and he’s had a hard time getting in touch with some of them.\n\n“When it floods like that, it’s just, it’s the worst. I lost my brother because of one of the floods we had some decades ago. He slipped, fell, and drowned. So it holds real close to me, it’s real tough to deal with,” he said.\n\nHow Columbus police use technology to solve crime\n\nSteele is working on putting together a fundraiser so a portion of his barbecue sales are donated to flood relief. He hopes it will start this weekend. Others in central Ohio are trying to do their part. Day 41 Disaster Relief has partnered with some local churches to collect much-needed supplies to bring to Texas.\n\n“If you are watching this and you feel led to give and you think well there’s only so much a can do, it’s not going to be enough, don’t listen to that, don’t be discouraged. If everybody were to just give a small donation that can add up,” said Kris Pokorny, a team member with Day 41 Disaster Relief.\n\nA list of the supplies being collected can be found here. They can be dropped off at The Naz Church in Grove City at 4770 Hoover Road and Discovery Church in Gahanna at 750 Cross Pointe Road, Suite L. Drop off hours will be 9 a.m.- 4 p.m. through Friday. Pokorny said plans are not finalized yet but they might drive the supplies to Texas this weekend or next week.\n\nJewishColumbus has shared ways to support flood relief efforts through Shalom Austin as well.\n\n“The Jewish value of Tikkun Olam, or ‘repairing the world,’ means being there for communities and people in need in times of crisis. As we watch the devastation unfold in Central Texas, we at JewishColumbus are doing our part to support Shalom Austin’s Flood Relief Campaign as they assess the most pressing needs for community members across the region and work with organizations providing on-the-ground support. We continue to hold those impacted in our thoughts and prayers as they face unimaginable loss and recovery,” wrote Julie Tilson Stanley, CEO of JewishColumbus.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Bitcoin is at a unique moment in its history, with widespread institutional adoption.\n\nXRP is building the scaffolding it needs to be favored by institutions as well.\n\nOne of these assets is better for longer-term holding than the other is likely to be.\n\n10 stocks we like better than XRP ›\n\nMost investing decisions feel like choosing between two distant futures. In crypto right now, one such fork in the road is whether to buy an asset built on engineered scarcity, or one engineered for regulated utility and widespread use.\n\nThe question matters because capital is finally pouring into both lanes at once.Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC)is drawing record institutional inflows whileXRP(CRYPTO: XRP)is winning a few serious gigs to provide financial plumbing. The trade‑off between slow‑burn \"digital gold\" and faster‑moving payment rails has never been starker, so let's sort out which path fits which kind of investor.\n\nBitcoin currently trades around $109,000 as of July 7 despite a considerable amount of recent macroeconomic volatility.\n\nThe latest leg higher came from purchasing driven by institutions and holders of large sums of capital, not small-time investors seeking a thrill.BlackRock's Bitcoinexchange-traded fund (ETF), theiShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, took in more than $1.3 billion in fresh cash in the last week of June, part of a haul of more than $4 billion that all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs absorbed in the month.\n\nCollectively, at least 116 public companies now hold a total of roughly 809,100 Bitcoins on their balance sheets, more than double the corporate stash a year ago.\n\nWhy does that matter? It's evidence that the \"demand\" portion of the supply and demand dynamics affecting the coin is very healthy. When paired with the favorable and ongoing action of thehalving process, one of the main factors affecting the coin's supply, it suggests that it's appropriate to be bullish about the coin.\n\nIn short, Bitcoin's issuance halves roughly every four years, crimping new supply just as ETF sponsors, corporates, and long‑term allocators compete for the float. Scarcity was always part of the asset's pitch, and now it is colliding with regulated distribution channels that make large buys painless for big buyers.\n\nIn theory, that should push the asset's price discovery into a narrower, mostly upward corridor, and for the long term. This catalyst is playing out right now.\n\nThe investment thesis for buying XRP is quite different.\n\nIt's priced near $2.28 today, and its ledger, XRPL, just activated an automated market maker (AMM) feature, letting any wallet convert assets on‑chain and earn fees from idle balances. That's a key feature for the chain's intended users, institutional investors.\n\nAnother important capability for courting that same audience is that XRPL bakes in regulator‑friendly tools, like authorized trust lines, blacklists, and the ability to freeze accounts so issuers can remain in good standing with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.\n\nThat matters because tokenizing real‑world assets (RWA) so that they can be handled more easily by asset managers is becoming big business, and compliance tooling is essential to capturing that business. The RWA sector's value hit $24.8 billion in June, and it could balloon to $30 trillion by 2034, per some estimates. XRP is already attracting key projects on its chain, including a $693 million Treasury bond fund, giving users 24\/7 access to short‑term government debt. As more assets are tokenized, having must-have assets like Treasuries on-chain will make the ledger an even more appealing place for institutional investors to park their capital.\n\nIn other words, with XRP the value-generating flywheel is liquidity at the scale that institutional investors need it. Each tokenized Treasury or corporate debt issue deepens its on‑ledger pools, reduces pricing inaccuracy for big transactions, and nudges newcomers to hold a small XRP reserve to transact.\n\nAssuming regulators stay comfortable with XRPL's top‑down compliance controls, that adoption curve could steepen over the next three to five years.\n\nThink of Bitcoin as a zero‑yield digital commodity whose upside comes from enforced scarcity meeting mainstream acceptance. Its payoff profile looks like a long-dated bond, with slow, steady, but potentially massive returns accruing across halving cycles for those who are patient.\n\nXRP is more like a fast‑growing fintech stock. Success hinges on product‑market fit and execution. Yet it's because of this elevated risk that the coin's ramp‑up, if it happens, could dwarf Bitcoin's percentage gains, and those gains could occur sooner.\n\nA balanced crypto portfolio might allocate 80% to Bitcoin for stability and 5% or so to XRP for higher risk exposure. The pair can coexist in the same account without any contradiction. Just be honest about your time horizon and risk tolerance before you choose your lane.\n\nAnd if you're only interested in choosing one, you should choose Bitcoin today. XRP is a great coin, but it is simply not the safer option at these lofty prices.\n\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them.

    "News_title":"Scientists Just Discovered That A Genetic Mutation May Protect Against Alzheimer's. Here's What They Found.",
    "News_text":"A new study suggests a gene mutation could have a protective effect against Alzheimer's.\n\nThe research looked specifically at blood stem cells, which live in the bone marrow and make different types of blood cells.\n\nHere's what you should know about the blood stem cell mutation and what this means for you.\n\nGenetic mutations aren't always a bad thing. A groundbreaking new study suggests that mutations on a singlegenemay actually be beneficial when it comes toAlzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journalCell Stem Cell, looked at blood stem cells' interaction with the brain, and howmutationson a single gene can protect againstAlzheimer's. “We now know that these cells that circulate in the blood also have the capacity to go into the brain,” saysKatherine King,MD, PhD, study co-author and professor at the Baylor College of Medicine. “That’s important in something like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nHere's what the research found, plus what it suggests for the future of Alzheimer’s treatment.\n\nMeet the experts:Clifford Segil,DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA;Katherine King,MD, PhD, is a study co-author and professor at the Baylor College of Medicine\n\nFor the study, Dr. King and her fellow researchers looked at blood stem cells in mice and humans. They discovered that people and mice with specific blood stem cell mutations in a gene called TET2 were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those without the mutation. As a result, the researchers concluded that there appears to be a “protective effect” of this mutation.\n\nBlood stem cells, a.k.a. hematopoietic stem cells, live in the bone marrow and make different types of blood cells, including red blood cells, immune cells, and platelets, Dr. King explains.\n\n“Immune cells protect us from infections, but they have an important role in helping the body stay healthy. That includes ‘taking out the trash,’” Dr. King explains, referring to cellular waste. “Our tissues normally produce waste and sometimes get injured. We have to clear out the injured cells to make way for healthy cells.”\n\nAs you age, these blood stem cells can develop mutations. The mutations don’t usually cause issues, but sometimes they cause cells to divide more than others and create a clone. That’s called clonal hematopoiesis, and it’s been linked to a higher risk for conditions like cardiovascular disease, leukemia, stroke, and more.\n\nBut blood stem cell mutations in the TET2 gene can travel to the brain, where they may actually help clear out damaged tissue that naturally accumulates with age, Dr. King explains. “In Alzheimer’s disease, there are proteins or parts of cells that are damaged tissues that build up,” she says. “We have to get rid of them or clear them away.”\n\nThis new research essentially found that the mutated blood stem cells can go to the brain and help with the process of “clearing out the trash,” King says.\n\nThe discovery has opened the door for potential new treatments, although we’re not quite there yet. “Supportive cells to brain neurons may be a future potential target for a therapy in humans, as removing old damaged cells may be a reasonable way to fight aging in the brain,” saysClifford Segil,DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. A future treatment that’s able to help healthy cells remove old or unhealthy cells may help improve brain health, he says.\n\nBut Dr. King says this process is a little complicated. “The change in stem cells isn’t totally benign: There are risks and benefits,” she says. “The same change that may be helpful with Alzheimer’s disease is also linked with other dangerous things like heart disease and strokes.”\n\nDr. King says it may be possible to engineer stem cells to follow specific pathways to help enhance the function of the brain without causing risks—but that’s still TBD.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nJennifer Garner Swears By This Retinol Eye Cream\n\nThese New Kicks Will Help You Smash Your Cross-Training Goals",

    "News_title":"How LinkedIn’s algorithm can help us find new uses for existing medicines",
    "News_text":"When you log onto LinkedIn, you’re normally presented with suggestions to connect with people you know, either because you went to the same university as them, or worked in the same company or industry.\n\nHowever, the suggestions can sometimes take us by surprise, like when the algorithm recommends a relative or family friend even though they work in a totally different field to you. Given the total lack of professional overlap, you might wonder how LinkedIn could possibly know about these real life relationships.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that drive these recommendations use a type of technology known as aGraph Neural Network, which is based ongraphs: mathematical structures made up of nodes and the links (also known as “edges”) that connect them. For a social network such as LinkedIn, a graph can be generated where the nodes represent each user, while the links are the connections between them.\n\nThese algorithms collect information from the immediate environment of each node – our direct connections on LinkedIn. They then aggregate that information and integrate it into the original node.\n\nAfter this process, each profile reflects both its own data and that of its immediate network. This process can be carried out several times – in the second iteration, when we aggregate information from our neighbours, they in turn will already have aggregated information from their own neighbours and, consequently, we will have information from the second neighbourhood.\n\nIn these networks, it is not just our own personal information that matters, but also who we have connected with and who our connections have connected with. Inthe full version of LinkedIn’s algorithm, as used in practice, there are not only nodes representing people, but also other types of nodes, such as companies or publications.\n\nThis means the algorithm can get information both from our personal connections and from the content we have marked as favourites or interacted with.\n\nIf, for instance, someone has your sister as a connection and has “liked” posts that your brother-in-law also likes, the algorithm can detect that you not only share similar interests, but that you may also be personally connected in some way.\n\nDeveloping a drug from scratch is extremely costly and time-consuming. The discovery process often resembles a funnel. At the top, all potential candidates enter and, after being narrowed down through various stages of research, only one is left to enter clinical trials. This drug will then (hopefully) pass through to become available for clinical use among the general population.\n\nThough it is necessary, the complexity of this provess meansdrug repurposinghas become increasingly common in recent decades. The aim of this process is not to design new drugs, but to find new uses for existing ones.\n\nTo treat a disease, we generally focus on targeting the proteins responsible for it. There are public and well-documented databases containing information on which proteins each drug targets, and these databases have grown considerably in recent years.\n\nOne of the most widely used databases,DrugBank, has gone from 841 approved drugs when it wasfirst released in 2006, to 2,751 in itsmost recent 2024 update. This growing availability of data allows for the use of more complex models.\n\nWith this volume of data, we can create a graph network where the nodes are drugs and proteins, and the links are the interactions between them, as recorded in databases. Once we have the network, we can then apply similar algorithms to those used in social media: for each drug, we add biochemical information about the proteins with which it interacts through the known connections.\n\nUsing this information, the model can then tell us the probability of a drug-protein interaction that we did not previously have in the database, as the algorithms can efficiently analyse large volumes of information. These interactions can then be validated under laboratory conditions, saving time and money from the lengthy discovery process.\n\nAt the Computational Biology and Translational Genomics lab at the University of Navarra, we have followed this idea to developGeNNius, a model that aims to build a network between drugs and proteins. Its implementation has already improved existing models, especially in terms of run time: in just one minute we can evaluate around 23,000 interactions.\n\nWhile the model has good predictive capabilities, there is still room for improvement. For instance, challenges arise when assessing possible interactions with molecules that are not part of the network, or for which we have little original data. Although it is technically possible to generate an output, the model often gives low confidence results in these cases.\n\nBy overcoming these obstacles and with further research, these models could evolve in the future into systems that provide personalised recommendations for each patient.\n\nEste artículo fue publicado originalmente enThe Conversation, un sitio de noticias sin fines de lucro dedicado a compartir ideas de expertos académicos.\n\nLee mas:\n\nThe toxic management handbook: six guaranteed ways to make your best employees flee\n\nGenius Act: this new US cryptocurrency law could pave the way for the next global financial crisis\n\nAI and art collide in this engineering course that puts human creativity first\n\nMikel Hernaez receives funding from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, the government of Navarra, the EU Department of Defence, the Carlos III Health Institute and the European Commission.\n\nUxía Veleiro receives funding from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities.",

REV102 is being developed to treat hypophosphatasia (HPP) -- a rare and debilitating genetic disorder that affects bone development.\n\nAccording to Recursion, \"HPP is a devastating genetic disorder affecting over 7,800 diagnosed patients across the U.S. and major European countries.\" It targets an enzyme, ENPP1, whose inhibition is believed to help treat HPP.\n\nUntil today, Recursion and Rallybio have had a joint venture to develop ENPP1 inhibitors, which have resulted in REV102, still in the preclinical stage of development.\n\nThe deal is good news for both companies. Focusing on Rallybio, the company will receive:\n\nSome much-needed cash in the form of $7.5 million in up-front equity\n\nAn equity payment of $12.5 million if REV102 undertakes additional preclinical trials\n\nA $5 million milestone payment after initiation of dosing in a phase 1 study\n\nLow-single-digit royalties on future sales of REV102\n\nMeanwhile, Recursion gains full ownership of REV102 and can now develop thedrugwithout worrying about Rallybio's consideration of the matter.\n\nThe agreement helps de-risk the development of REV102 and removes uncertainty around it in connection with Rallybio's financial condition.

    "News_text":"Holloman Lake in southern New Mexico has captured the attention of environmental scientists worldwide, and not for the reasons anyone wanted.\n\nAnewly published studyfound the lake now holds the highest levels of toxic “forever chemicals” ever recorded in natural water.\n\nResearchers from the University of New Mexico discovered staggering concentrations of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in the lake’s water, surrounding soil, vegetation, and wildlife. In some samples, levels exceeded federal drinking water limits by more than 10,000 times. One bird and one plant tested carried the highest PFAS loads ever documented globally.\n\nOften used in firefighting foam and industrial products, PFAS are linked to cancer, hormone disruption, infertility, and immune issues, and they don’t break down easily in the environment. What makes the findings at Holloman so alarming is that contamination doesn’t stop at the water’s edge.\n\nAccording to the report, flooding from the lake has carried PFAS into nearby playas—temporary bodies of water that serve as crucial habitats for migratory birds. Scientists worry the chemicals could now be spreading across ecosystems via wildlife. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported that just one bite of duck meat from the lake could expose a person to a lifetime’s worth of PFAS.\n\n“We are worried about the possibility of toxicity on reproduction and development in local birds,”said lead researcher Jean-Luc Cartron. “Contamination by PFAS could also be transgenerational.”\n\nResearchers also observed oryx, an exotic species introduced to the region decades ago, drinking from the lake. And while hunting has been banned in the area since 2024, New Mexico health officials have warned anyone who consumed meat from Holloman wildlife in the past decade to consult a doctor.\n\nThis discovery adds fuel to a growing conversation about PFAS pollution in the U.S. and beyond. While other contaminated lakes exist, none have reached these levels. And although scientists are making progress in removing PFAS from water, the scale of the challenge remains massive.\n\nThe crisis at Holloman Lake isn’t just a local issue.

    "News_text":"Bitcoin isn't an asset held by most central banks.\n\nIt still has a handful of the properties that are common to reserve currencies.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that it will eventually be regarded as a reserve asset.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›\n\nGold has long been an asset that central bankers prefer to hold on their balance sheets. Today, with global finance digitizing by the month, an asset born entirely on the internet is now auditioning for the same role.\n\nThat asset isBitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC), and the audition is getting very serious. In fact, I predict that sometime within the next 10 years, this coin will become a reserve asset that at least a few central banks around the world will aspire to hold for the long term.\n\nThere are a few things that clearly point toward a scenario where Bitcoin sits beside gold and U.S. Treasuries as an important reserve asset. Let's see what makes this scenario likely, and why things look brighter than ever for the cryptocurrency's future.\n\nA reserve asset must be reliably scarce, and this coin has that quality covered better than any other such asset.\n\nBitcoin's supply is hard-capped at 21 million coins, and 93.3% of that total is already in circulation, leaving very little future dilution possible.\n\nAs with precious metals, substantial capital investment is required tominethe unexploited supply. But unlike in metals, with Bitcoin, there can be no fresh discovery that will boost output. That makes its supply even more reliably constrained than gold over the very long run.\n\nFurthermore, its issuance falls by 50% roughly every four years inthe halving, meaning the asset's inflation rate trends toward zero on an automatic schedule. That sounds like something central bankers would appreciate, as it eliminates some of the need to rebalance the value of the holding due to any drift caused by inflation.\n\nAnother big plus is that a growing slice of that finite pile is migrating into sovereign and quasi-sovereign hands. Such holders are not apt to dump their holdings abruptly and cause volatility.\n\nGovernments collectively hold 2.3% of all mined coins. That's more than 463,000 Bitcoin, mostly sourced from seizures that authorities decided not to auction away. The floating supply shrinks further when corporations add coins to their treasuries or exchange-traded fund (ETF) sponsors warehouse inventory for retail buyers.\n\nScarcity is only half the story here. Neutrality is the other.\n\nBitcoin is not an asset with any regard for politics or sanctions lists in any specific country. For central banks managing currency volatility, that independence can be a hedge against counterparties weaponizing payment rails.\n\nGold does the same job, but moving bullion across borders is slow and expensive. A coin with digital scarcity and which clears in minutes is an upgrade that many policymakers will not ignore forever.\n\nA reserve asset must be easy to hold in custody, and transparent to audit. That infrastructure is arriving fast for Bitcoin.\n\nCustody is easier than ever. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) reversal of its 2022 guidance this February freed Wall Street banks to hold digital assets without capital charges, opening the door for giants to compete for official-sector mandates.\n\nNext come regulated wrappers. ETFs mean that central banks that are barred from trading on crypto exchanges can buy ETF shares as easily as they buy gold ETFs today. There are no more major barriers to access, whether by using a financial instrument or by buying the coin on-chain directly. This also ensures that the asset remains highly liquid across financial systems, another desirable trait for a reserve asset.\n\nThe clearest signal that Bitcoin will be a reserve asset, however, comes from monetary authorities themselves.\n\nIn January, the Czech National Bank disclosed that it is studying a multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin allocation for its reserves, the first such public exploration by a Western central bank. Other central banks, like the one in Switzerland, have already ruled out onboarding the coin as a reserve asset. But even a pilot stake by one midsize central bank could pressure peers to craft a policy response, lest they appear unprepared if Bitcoin rallies sharply.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin's price can still whipsaw, and a coordinated crackdown by major economies would chill adoption. But the direction of travel is clear: More liquidity is here, as is more sovereign interest.\n\nAssuming regulatory momentum stays positive and custody continues to institutionalize, Bitcoin's jump from outsider money to a reserve asset looks less like science fiction and more like the natural progression of digital finance.\n\nFor investors, the implication is straightforward. Reserve demand is sticky and insensitive to day-to-day volatility. Gold purchased by central banks usually remains in their reserves for decades. A similar mindset would apply to Bitcoin.\n\nThat extra layer of permanent demand could tighten supply even more, driving the coin's value higher over long timeframes.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

    "News_text":"For decades, scientists have argued over one of neuroscience’s most fundamental questions: Can the adult human brain grow new neurons? Now, researchers say they finally have the answer, and it changes everything.\n\nA team led by Marta Paterlini at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden published their findings inScience.The study confirms that neurogenesis, the process of forming new brain cells, does in fact occur in adult humans—even into old age.\n\nResearchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found clear evidence of neural precursor cells and immature neurons in brains ranging from children to adults as old as 78.\n\nThat discovery finally settles a controversy that’s lingered for more than 60 years.\n\nIn other animals, scientists have long known that the brain continues to make new neurons throughout life. But in humans, evidence was murky. Some previous studies identified young-looking brain cells in adults, but it wasn’t clear if they were truly new or just slowly maturing cells leftover from early development.\n\nTo find out, researchers used advanced RNA sequencing to detect the molecular signatures of newly formed neurons and their precursors. First, they tested brain samples from children. Then, they searched for those same genetic markers in 19 postmortem brains ranging from 13 to 78 years old.\n\nThey found what they were looking for—proof of active neurogenesis in most of the adult samples, including in regions of the hippocampus, the part of the brain involved in memory and learning.\n\nThe findings open new doors for brain research, especially when it comes to neurodegenerative diseases and mental health conditions.\n\nDisrupted neurogenesis has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease and depression in mice, raising the possibility that therapies targeting this process could help prevent or treat these conditions in humans. Knowing these cells still exist in adulthood opens potential pathways for therapies that could stimulate brain regeneration.\n\nRelated: Surprise Discovery Could Rewrite What We Know About Alzheimer’s\n\nScientists now believe other areas of the brain could also support neurogenesis, but that research is still ongoing.\n\nThis study doesn’t just lay to rest a stubborn scientific question. It lays a foundation for new research into brain plasticity, aging, and mental illness. As scientists now have proof of active neurogenesis in adult humans, the next steps will target how to harness and enhance this natural capacity.\n\nFor now, the long-standing debate has finally been resolved. Adult brains don’t just age—they adapt, and in some cases, they even grow.\n\nRelated: OCD’s Origins May Not Be What You Think, Researchers Say\n\nScientists Just Ended a 60-Year Debate About the Human Brainfirst appeared on Men's Journal on Jul 10, 2025",

Zola and former assistant district attorney Drew McLaughlin told the jury Torner ordered Alzugaray to kill Herran, whose body was dismembered and parts of the remains were burned or discarded in the Lehigh River near White Haven.\n\nProsecutors argued Torner wanted Herran killed as he learned Herran was an informant for a federal law enforcement agency.\n\nTorner appealed the conviction and his life sentence, claiming Lupas wrongfully permitted Richard DeStefano to testify about dismembering and chopping up bodies when Torner lived in New Jersey before relocating to Freeland.\n\nDeStefano testified that Torner told him that when Torner was younger, he participated with others to dismember bodies and dumped the remains in drains.\n\nDespite Torner's attorney, Robert Saurman, objecting to DeStefano's testimony as he believed it was prejudicial, Lupas allowed the jury to hear DeStefano's testimony.\n\nA three-member panel of the Pennsylvania Superior Court, in a 15-page opinion, agreed with Lupas.\n\n\"...the trial court (Lupas) determined that the evidence of Torner's prior acts showed a common plan, such that Torner participated in killing Herran and dismembering Herran's body like he had participated in 'cutting up the bodies' when he was younger....(Lupas) did not abuse its discretion by finding that Torner's statement about cutting up bodies connected him to the (Herran) crime,\" the appellate court ruled.\n\nReporter's note: The Roberto Torner criminal homicide case will be featured in a true crime documentary to be aired on a yet-to-be-determined date on the Investigation Discovery Channel and HBO Max.

    "News_text":"TheDenver Museum of Nature & Sciencealready houses a vast trove ofdinosaur bones, but it recently received an unexpected addition to the collection. The latest fossil didn’t come from a generous benefactor or anonymous donor–it came from beneath the museum’s own parking lot.\n\n“This may be the most unusual dinosaur discovery I have ever been a part of,” DMNS director of Earth and Space Sciences Patrick O’Connorsaid in a statement.\n\nThe find happened in January, when the museum began a drilling project to assess the possibility of switchingfrom natural gas to geothermal energy. The test also offered an opportunity for researchers to simultaneously oversee a scientific coring initiative to better understand the Denver Basin’s geology. To do so, a pair of drill rigs each bored a one-foot-wide hole into the ground that the team then used to extract samples. But about 763 feet below the blacktop, geologists found more than just sediment deposited by the South Platte River—they discovered a pair of bone fragments.\n\n“It’s basically like winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning on the same day,” DMNS curator of geology James Hagadornsaid in an interview. “No one could have predicted that this little square foot of land where we started drilling would actually contain a dinosaur bone beneath it.”\n\nThe larger of the two fossils unfortunately didn’t survive its encounter with diggers’ drill bit. But before fragmenting, the bone measured about 1.9 inches long, 2.3 inches wide, and 2.3 inches tall. A subsequent analysis published in the journalRocky Mountain Geologyindicated the vertebra belonged to an herbivore similar to aThescelosaurusorEdmontosaurus.\n\nAt 67.5 million years old, it is the oldest and deepest dinosaur fossil ever discovered in Denver, offering a window into the region right before theCretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction event. As the DMNS explains in itsaccompanying profile, Denver looked vastly different during the Cretaceous than it does today. Instead of snowy mountains, tropical rainforests and swampy lowland floodplains covered Colorado with dinosaurs like theTyrannosaurus rexroaming around.\n\n“In my 35 years at the museum, we’ve never had an opportunity quite like this—to study the deep geologic layers beneath our feet with such precision,” DMNS Earth Sciences research associate Bob Raynolds said. “That this fossil turned up here… is nothing short of magical.”\n\nIt remains to be seen if the museum will eventually make the shift to geothermal energy. In the meantime, visitors can see the unexpected discovery on display as part of a temporary exhibit.",

It’s an injustice, a crime, because… I don’t know what you don’t see in me. I’m the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman. I will punish all of you for it.”\n\nKyle Green-Pool\/Getty\n\nRodger said he planned to enter “the hottest sorority house” and “slaughter every spoiled, stuck-up, blonde slut I see inside there.”\n\nRodger’s attack seemingly inspired Alek Minassian to run down 10 people, mostly women, on a Toronto street in 2018. According to theBBC, before his attack, Minassian posted on Facebook: \"The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!\"\n\nMinassian was convicted of the murders in 2021, TheNew York Timesreported.\n\nIn the docuseries, Kristine Cameron, administrator of the University of Idaho Murders Facebook page, said shortly after the murders a Facebook user named Pappa Rodger began leaving disturbing messages in their discussion group.\n\n“Did the killer stop at 4 victims out of exhaustion, convenience, or lack of knowledge?” Pappa Rodger posted. “Did the killer shower at the crime scene afterward?”\n\nOther posts included mentions of the fixed blade knife used in the crime and the discovery of a sheath left behind, though at the time no information about a sheath being left behind had been made public.\n\n“After Bryan Kohberger is arrested, I start thinking, okay, Pappa Rodger, Elliot Rodger, if you listen to some of the manifestos of Elliot Rodger, he talks about hating all the girls from Alpha Phi, the same sorority that Kaylee [Goncalves] was in.”\n\nPosts from Pappa Rodger stopped following Kohberger's arrest, and the profile was deleted. Cameron believes it was Kohberger behind the screen.\n\n“Bryan was interested in a lot of things that we learned, but he did have more of an interest in Elliot Rodger,” said Slaven, the former classmate. “I talked to other girls in the class where we were all bothered by what Elliot Rodger did, but Bryan did not seem bothered.”\n\nFerraro referred to Kohberger as an \"oddball\" in the docuseries. \"He is smart, but he's like a robot,\" he said. \"Purely based off the fact of his social inability to perform in a normal human manner, I can absolutely see someone like him being involved in something like this.”\n\nRead the original article onPeople",

Earlier this year, xAI, the company behind chatbot Grok, acquired X in a deal that valued the social network at $33 billion.\n\nThis week, Grok posted several antisemitic remarks on X, which could make some users and advertisers wary about using the platform.\n\nRead more:'A stab in the back.'

She led X through a tumultuous period when some advertisers abandoned the platform because of concerns that their ads would show up next to offensive content.\n\nYaccarino, 61, didn't say why she was leaving X but emphasized that her role involved helping to turn the company around.\n\n\"We started with the critical early work necessary to prioritize the safety of our users — especially children, and to restore advertiser confidence,\" she said on X.\n\nMusk's outspoken nature posed challenges for the social network's advertising business. Major brands including Apple, Disney and Warner Bros Discovery paused their advertising campaigns on the platform in 2023 after Musk backed an antisemitic post on the social network.\n\nTensions escalated after Musk told advertisers they could \"f— yourself\" at the 2023 DealBook Summit in New York, remarks that Yaccarino addressed.\n\nJasmine Enberg, vice president and a principal analyst at eMarketer, said in a statement that Yaccarino took on a tough job and lasted longer than expected.\n\n\"Faced with a mercurial owner who never fully stepped away from the helm and continued to use the platform as his personal megaphone, Yaccarino had to try to run the business while also regularly putting out fires,\" she said.\n\nMarket research companyeMarketerprojects that X will see ad revenue growth for the first time in four years in 2025.

(WPRI) — A judge has agreed to delay the sentencing of a man convicted of brutally stabbing an elderly Woonsocket woman to death nearly nine years ago.\n\nMatthew Dusseault, 27, wasfound guiltyearlier this year of first-degree murder in connection with the March 2016 death of 81-year-old Constance Gauthier.\n\nDusseault wastaken into custodytwo years after Gauthier’s body was found underneath a mattress in her bedroom. Investigators believe she was stabbed more than 60 times and her home was staged to look like it had been ransacked.\n\nProsecutors pointed tothe discovery of Dusseault’s DNA mixed with Gauthier’s bloodon her bedroom furniture.\n\nDusseaultsought a new trialback in March, but Judge Maureen Keough denied his request. He was supposed to be sentenced Thursday morning, but Keough agreed to push the sentencing back so Dusseault’s defense attorney could build a case as to why he should be given a chance at parole.\n\nAttorney Mark Smith told Keough he believes Dusseault, who was 18 years old at the time of the murder, was too young to understand what he was doing.\n\n“This case is more important than just Matthew Dusseault,” Smith said. “It’s for all the Matthew Dusseaults who committed murder between the ages of 18 and 20.”\n\nSmith mentionedCommonwealth v. Mattis, which determined that life sentences without parole for emerging adults are unconstitutional.\n\n“Experts introduced 43 different studies on brain development,” Smith said, referring to the Mattis case.\n\nSmith also brought upMario’s Law, which makes inmates sentenced before their 22nd birthday eligible for early release after serving at least 20 years behind bars. He believes similar logic should apply to Dusseault, even though he hasn’t been sentenced yet.\n\nDespite Smith’s arguments, Dusseault is still maintaining his innocence. Speaking for the first time in court, Dusseault expressed concerns regarding how Smith handled his defense throughout the trial.\n\n“I kept telling [Smith] to please help me. I am innocent,” Dusseault said. “He made decisions without me. He removed [witnesses] I wanted to take the stand on my behalf.”\n\nKeough was quick to push back against his arguments.\n\n“He’s never been anything other than a zealous advocate for his clients,” Keough said of Smith. “I find it hard to believe that this time was any different.”\n\nDusseault’s mother attempted to interject by raising her hand in court, but was also shut down by Keough.\n\n“Ma’am, you can put your hand down. This isn’t school and you can’t do that,” Keough said.\n\nHis mother told 12 News outside court that she was frustrated that Keough didn’t consider any of her son’s concerns.\n\n“I just wanted to get up and clarify to her that all he wants is an advocate,” she explained, adding that her son . “Someone to help him understand.”\n\nKeough is giving Smith time to come up with a game plan prior to Dusseault’s sentencing, which has not been rescheduled yet.\n\n“It took a long time to get this trial to this point, but Smith is correct — it’s a big decision,” she said. “We’re talking about what could be a life sentence or life without parole. It’s incredibly significant.”\n\nDusseault is expected back in court in September for a status hearing.\n\nDownload theWPRI 12andPinpoint Weather 12apps to get breaking news and weather alerts.\n\nWatch12 News Now on WPRI.comor with the new12+ smart TV app.\n\nFollow us on social media:\n\nClose\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nWatch for us in your inbox.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"DENVER (KDVR) — Uranium has been found at the site of the Chimney Hollow Reservoir, which is currently under construction just west of Carter Lake in Larimer County.\n\nThe town of Superior, which is one of nine cities, two water districts and a power providerset to benefitfrom the Chimney Hollow Reservoir Project, announced Thursday that it is “monitoring water quality concerns” from the site.\n\nA good shower is a simple shower, no matter what influencers recommend\n\nChimney Hollow Reservoir, which has been under construction since 2021, is being built to “help firm up water rights” for several municipalities that rely on raw water from the public agency Northern Water, according to Superior.\n\nThe town advised residents that it anticipates a need to treat for some level of uranium in the future, but said its water treatment plant is equipped to remove uranium levels “well below” themaximum contaminant level— the highest level of a contaminant allowed in drinking water.\n\n“We continue to monitor the situation closely and are actively working with Northern Water specialists to resolve the issue,” the town said in a news release.\n\nAccording to theNavajo Nation EPA, contact with uranium can have chemical and radiological effects on the body, including kidney damage and increasing the risk for high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, reproductive problems and lung and bone cancer.\n\nSuperior said it currently receives most of its raw, untreated water from snow melt in the Upper Colorado River Basin, as part of Northern Water’sBig Thompson Project.\n\nIn addition to Superior, Chimney Hollow Reservoir will benefit Broomfield, Loveland, Greeley, Erie, Longmont, Louisville, Fort Lupton, Lafayette, the Little Thompson Water District, the Central Weld County Water District and the Platte River Power Authority.\n\nNorthern Water said in ahandoutthat preliminary data from ongoing water quality testing indicate a risk of elevated uranium concentrations at Chimney Hollow Reservoir above the water supply standard, with the duration of the risk “uncertain” and under investigation.\n\nThe agency said the risk is expected to decrease over time, however, and that no water will be delivered from the reservoir “until all assessments are complete.” A mitigation plan is also being developed “to ensure a safe water supply,” Northern Water said.\n\nOver 1,700 trout relocated from Mason Reservoir during repairs\n\n“Although discovery of uranium is a setback to initial plans, it is an issue that can be safely managed and is expected to reduce over time,” the agency said.\n\nNorthern Water said it is also evaluating the first fill schedule “in light of this discovery,” but that Chimney Hollow Reservoir “remains a valuable part of securing water supply needs for Northern Colorado and its future.”\n\nSuperior said water quality tests revealed elevated levels of uranium in water that was part of an emergency discharge from the cofferdam at Chimney Hollow Reservoir during a “significant rain event” in 2023.\n\nNorthern Water said uranium monitoring has been ongoing since December 2021, but that it had not previously been a concern due to consistently low levels.\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of regulating uranium and hasset the MCLat 30 micrograms per liter. Northern Water said uranium concentrations had remained below this limit — and often below 10 micrograms per liter — through spring 2023.\n\nA sample collected from the site after the emergency discharge in 2023, however, detected a uranium level of 225 micrograms per liter, according to Northern Water.\n\nThe agency said the initial detection did not “fully reveal the scope of the issue,” however, and that uranium levels through the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 were only “episodically elevated” and returned to lower levels “after the initial spike.”\n\n“Because the source of the uranium was unknown and the elevated levels were not sustained, the issue did not appear to be ongoing at that time,” Northern Water said.\n\nMan dies while swimming toward boat on Prewitt Reservoir: CPW\n\nNorthern Water said uranium levels rose again — and more consistently and at higher elevations — after a second emergency discharge event in spring 2024, prompting a formal investigation into the source of the uranium.\n\nIt was not until January and February of this year that naturally sheared granite rock processed during construction became suspected as a potential source of the uranium, according to the agency, which said subsequent leaching tests conducted in February and March of this year confirmed the suspicions.\n\n“Investigations have clearly indicated granitic rock used to provide material from the quarry as the source of uranium,” Northern Water said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Jul. 10—WILKES-BARRE — A Forty Fort man blamed a brain injury he suffered in 2008 while his wife pledged she had no idea her husband was abusing a 13-year-old boy they reportedly had guardianship rights over inside their Wyoming Avenue residence.\n\nLuzerne County Assistant District Attorney James L. McMonagle Jr. said the criminal cases against Sean Williams, 50, and Dana Williams, 59, were among the worst he has ever experienced as a prosecutor.\n\n\"These were horrific actions against this young boy,\" McMonagle said during the separate sentencing hearings that became turbulent at times before Judge Joseph F. Sklarosky Jr. on Thursday.\n\nForty Fort police and detectives from the district attorney's office arrested the couple in September 2023, after a welfare check was conducted on the boy in Georgia. When the boy was not found in Douglasville, Ga., detectives learned the boy was possibly staying at the Williams' residence, according to court records.\n\nAs detectives were inside Williams' residence, they noticed suspicious movements by three other children, which resulted in the discovery of the 13-year-old boy in the basement, court records say.\n\nCourt records say the boy was found hiding inside a tiny crevice in the basement where he slept on the concrete floor without a mattress and a pillow. Only a torn sheet was found in the crevice, court records say.\n\nDetectives in court records say food was withheld from the boy, who was often strangled and assaulted by Sean Williams.\n\nDuring a forensic interview at the Luzerne County Children Advocacy Center, the boy said he was forced by Sean Williams to eat his own vomit, court records say.\n\nMcMonagle said the boy, now 15, is in foster care.\n\nSean Williams' attorney, William A. Watkins, of Stroudsburg, said his client suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2008 that often makes him forgetful, while Dana Williams said she had no idea her husband was abusing the boy.\n\n\"The conduct in this case is disturbing,\" Sklarosky said.\n\nSklarosky sentenced Sean Williams to six months to two years at the county correctional facility on charges of endangering the welfare of a child, tampering with evidence and simple assault. Sean Williams was also sentenced to three years probation after he is released.\n\nFor the sentence of Dana Williams, Sklarosky threatened to void her no contest plea to endangering the welfare of a child when she claimed she had no knowledge the boy was being abused by her husband, even though, at the time, she worked from home.\n\n\"You dropped the ball here and you should be ashamed of yourself,\" the judge told Dana Williams, who was sentenced to two days to two years at the county correctional facility but was immediately paroled when given credit for two days served after her arrest in September 2023.\n\nDana Williams has since relocated to Lehigh County.",

    "News_text":"MENOMONIE — It’s not just the trial over a woman’s claims against author Neil Gaiman that will be delayed until 2026 — discovery won’t even be complete until midyear.\n\nAttorneys for Gaiman and Scarlett Pavlovich jointly filed the broad outline for discovery, the process in which the parties can get evidence from each other. Pavlovich made the accusations of sexual and emotional abuse against Gaiman early in 2025 in a magazine interview and filed suit in February.\n\nPavlovich has said she was living on a beach in New Zealand when she met Amanda Palmer, Gaiman’s estranged wife. The meeting led to a job as a caretaker for the couple’s son. She contends Gaiman repeatedly sexually assaulted her over the course of her employment and, when she told Palmer about it, was told more than a dozen other women had told her similar things.\n\nThe filing clarifies the position of Palmer. She was initially listed as a defendant in the case, accused of “procuring and presenting Plaintiff to Gaiman for such abuse,” but Pavlovich’s attorney later dropped her from the suit. The filing lists probable witnesses whose depositions will be needed, and the plaintiff’s list includes Palmer.\n\nThe sides are limiting depositions by agreement, at least for now. Only 15 oral depositions may be taken, as well as 25 written depositions. They can request admission of up to 30 items from discovery each.\n\nThey differ, though, on the number of requests for production each side may issue. Pavlovich’s attorney suggested a limit of 30 such requests, while the defense objects to any limit. Gaiman’s attorney also suggests the depositions may be comparatively brief. While some cases have involved multiple days of questioning, that probably won’t be the case here.\n\n“Defendant notes that a great number of these witnesses will testify to very discreet issues and the parties will not need an entire day for each deposition,” the filing reads. It also opens the door to video depositions, which could be important given that some witnesses live in different countries.\n\nAll service of document requests must be made by April 4, 2026. Discovery must be complete by June 4, 2026 and pretrial disclosures have a June 18, 2026 deadline. Dispositive motions, which would settle part of all of the case, are due by Feb. 2, 2026.",

    "News_text":"MEMPHIS, Tenn.– It’s video you’ll only see on Your News Leader. Law enforcement agents uncovered an unsuspecting device used to steal your credit card information at a North Memphis grocery store.\n\nThe discovery was part of a secret service operation that took place this week to combat a crime targeting lower-income families.\n\nFor the last two years, WREG Investigators have told you about the drastic rise in a ruthless crime. Criminals use devices to illegally capture EBT card information. They often duplicate the card and drain SNAP benefits within minutes of being deposited into a person’s account.\n\nIt’s a tactic known as skimming.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Secret Service gathered federal, state, and local partners for a highly coordinated operation to combat it.\n\n“We couldn’t do this without you. We do not have the manpower to go out and check the numbers that we have,” Mark Switzer, special agent in charge of the Memphis field office, said in a morning briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe goal was to find the illegal skimming devices while also educating businesses on what to look for. Twelve teams saturated West Tennessee and North Mississippi on Tuesday and Wednesday, and WREG Investigators got an exclusive look.\n\n“With a partnership with the USDA, we’ve identified a number of point-of-sale terminals for EBT cards and some potential points of compromise,” Switzer said.\n\nWe went out with one of the teams as they went from business to business inspecting ATMs, gas pumps, and point-of-sale terminals for skimming devices.\n\n“These things get placed right on top of the point-of-sale terminal,” Switzer said.\n\nThey look like the real deal. They capture the data as each button is pushed while also pushing the real buttons underneath.\n\nSwitzer said the systems are becoming more sophisticated. Sometimes the criminals work in groups overseas. Other times, they gather the data and sell it on the dark web.\n\n“There’s a number of levels of criminals that are out there getting a hold of this information and then using it for their own purposes, whether that be for personal gain or whether that be to finance some type of other criminal activity,” Switzer said.\n\nAgents pried off the skimming device they found at the grocery store in North Memphis. It unveiled a keypad and reader attached by double-sided tape stuck to the real one.\n\nIt was marked as evidence. Agents will now work to find out who installed it and how long it’s been there.\n\n“It’s estimated that every skimmer that is recovered is about $1 million worth of fraud that we prevent,” Switzer said.\n\nAgents went to more than 400 businesses. They inspected 2,200 point-of-sale terminals, 857 gas pumps, and 234 ATMs. Four skimming devices were found.\n\nBased on that number, it’s estimated this operation prevented around $4 million worth of fraud. These operations have been taking place across the country and are believed to have stopped more than $200 million in theft.\n\nSwitzer said chip readers on EBT cards would also help combat the fraud.\n\n“The ability exists to be able to skim cards with chip readers, but it’s very few and far between,” he said.\n\nIn Tennessee, EBT cards don’t have embedded microchips like you have on your bank card. They use a magnetic stripe, which is an older technology, making it much easier to compromise.\n\nTheUSDA admitschip cards are “an important step to ensure that SNAP benefits are protected,” but it’s up to the state to take that step.\n\nOnly a handful of states have or will soon offer EBT cards with chips. The Tennessee Department of Human Services stated it’s “exploring all available options to ensure effective fraud mitigation and protection for customers.”\n\n“We live paycheck to paycheck,” Katherine Jones saidin a recent interview.\n\nThe grandmother is an authorized representative on her daughter’s account. Thieves compromised her card and drained the family’s SNAP benefits in April and in May.\n\n“It’s just frustrating that, you know, people can so easily access your information and use it without a care in the world,” she said.\n\nSwitzer said that’s why this work is vital.\n\n“While they lose, there’s the potential that taxpayers lose as well,” he said. “Their taxes are going to help offset some of this.”\n\nIn 2022, U.S. Congress approved replacing stolen benefits, but that came to an end in December.\n\nStates can choose to replace the benefits, but Tennessee hasn’t opted in.\n\nHow the FBI says you can protect yourself against skimming:click here\n\nTDHS advises customers to take proactive security measures by usingebtEDGEto protect their benefits, including:\n\nUtilization of card-freezing features\n\nRegular PIN updates\n\nMonitoring account activity for suspicious transactions\n\nReporting unauthorized transactions immediately to mitigate further losses\n\nThe ebtEDGE mobile app allows customers to log-in securely using touch ID or facial recognition instead of entering a user ID and password.

    "News_title":"Why US airlines are charging solo travellers more (and Ryanair is doing the opposite)",
    "News_text":"Travelling solo can be tricky enough without having to pay a special premium for the privilege. So singletons and solo adventurers alike may be raising an eyebrow at news from the States that three of the country’s biggest airlines – American, United and Delta – are charging higher prices for lone passengers.\n\nIn some cases, the difference is hefty: the US travel websiteThrifty Travelerfound that single passengers on a United flight from Chicago to a smaller city in Illinois (Peoria) were being charged $269 to fly, compared to just $181 for those travelling as a pair – a saving of one third.\n\nIt isn’t an isolated example. Another US travel website,The Points Guy, carried out a detailed analysis of some 3,000 domestic flights on a single day in the States and found that 7 per cent of them were charging a higher price to passengers having the audacity to travel alone.\n\nWhy the premium? While airlines are notoriously secretive about their pricing methods, one reason being put forward is that the algorithms may assume that those travelling on their own are more likely to be business customers who are less likely to object to the higher rates.\n\nCurious to check the phenomenon for myself, I spent 15 minutes on the United website and was soon able to find a live example of this dual pricing in action: an economy flight from Chicago to Lexington whose per-person price dropped by $58 when I included a second passenger, from $283 to $226.\n\nEven more curiously, the tax breakdown on the United website showed that the tax per passenger was actually slightlylesswhen two passengers were on the same booking – meaning that the higher rate was entirely down to airline policy.\n\nBad news, then, for anyone planning their own solo venture across the States. But given that American airlines have long set the trends on things like baggage fees, is there any chance that this depressing trend could soon take hold on this side of the pond too?\n\nConsumer experts told me they had not seen any examples of European airlines charging single passengers more. But when I conducted my own research by testing flight prices on Ryanair, I found what appeared to be the opposite phenomenon.\n\nLooking at flights from Stansted to Podgorica, for example, I was quoted £142.69 for a basic fare as a solo traveller, but £157.69 (each) for two passengers on the same flight. Likewise, a one-way flight from Stansted to Prague jumped from £71.54 to £82.04 when I added a second passenger.\n\nI was able to find more examples of the same thing happening, with the price jumping between 10 and 15 per cent when a second passenger was added to the booking. All of these flights had one thing in common: namely that the single passenger was told there was “only one seat left at this price”.\n\nAnyone who has booked a Ryanair flight will have seen similar messages appearing. But even if there’s only one discount seat left, you might assume that someone booking two tickets would get the last remaining bargain price plus the next cheapest seat on offer – but you’d be wrong.\n\nWhen I contacted Ryanair, they told me that “our system defaults all passengers in the booking to the next available fare class”. In short, that means that if there is only one seat left at the cheapest price, then it will only be available to customers purchasing a single ticket.\n\nBy contrast, if you were booking as a couple, the system would automatically allocate you into the first pricing bracket in which two seats were available, even if that means leaving that discount seat on offer for someone else to snap up at a later time.\n\nOf course, there’s nothing to stop you booking the tickets separately and getting the cheaper price. But how many travellers are going to have the foresight to do that?\n\nI was surprised to find out that couples were potentially losing out. Particularly since the consumer experts at Which? told me that the usual pattern is to see singletons paying more when it comes to holiday deals. In 2023,they revealedthat solo travellers were charged an average of 47 per cent more when paying a Tui package holiday.\n\nLikewise, it is common for some cruise companies to levy an extra surcharge on solo holidaymakers, on the basis that they are taking up a room which was likely designed for two paying customers.\n\n“Companies should be up front about any pricing practices they are using or single supplements so travellers can make informed decisions and choose the best holiday for them,” saysWhich?’s travel expert Rory Boland.\n\n“To avoid paying over the odds, we’d recommend looking for companies that waive single supplements. Make sure you’re getting a good deal by comparing the total against the per person price of a couple’s package.”\n\nBut where does that leave the United and Ryanair examples, where an airline is charging passengers different prices for exactly the same seats based on whether they are booking on their own or not?\n\nThe expert consensus is that the practice is another example of so-called “dynamic pricing”, where airlines adjust their ticket prices to meet the strength of demand. The practice certainly isn’t illegal, but it can be controversial: particularly when the algorithms are such a tightly-guarded trade secret.\n\nIn practice, though, most customers have made their peace with dynamic pricing for airline tickets on the basis that it usually means cheaper getaways in the long run (particularly when you can plan ahead). But the nature of that flexibility means that there will always be some passengers who end up losing out.\n\nAs always, the best way to avoid ending up in that category is to make sure you do your homework in advance when booking flights – particularly if you happen to be planning on a solo flight from Chicago any time soon.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"SPRINGFIELD — Families can turn up the heat on summer fun while staying cool in air-conditioned halls at theSpringfield Museums.\n\nNow open seven days a week through Aug. 15, the museums are offering a slate of activities including hands-on exhibitions, live entertainment on the Quadrangle Green, and music inspired by cultures from around the globe.\n\nMost summer activities are included with Museum admission, and that cost is waived for Springfield residents with proof of residence.\n\n“I am hoping that visitors and their families leave the museums this summer thinking ‘I’ve learned something new,’” said Abby Garner, Family Engagement Coordinator for the Springfield Museums, in an interview with The Republican. “Whether that is from the planetarium, one of our musical performances, the additional activities we are offering, or from one of our visiting exhibits.”\n\nSome of the Museums’ summer activities are returning favorites, like the return of Giant Bubbles with Mr. Vinny, a show on the Quadrangle each Friday afternoon that encourages children to watch, chase and pop bubbles. The Toe Jam Puppet Band, a children’s entertainment troupe that combines music, puppetry and storytelling, also returns.\n\nOther activities, like hands-on experiences in the Cat’s Corner, Hasbro Games Art Discovery Center and Spark!Lab, were curated by the Museum’s education staff for this year’s summer programming.\n\nIn theCat’s Corner, located inside of The Amazing World of Dr. Seuss Museum, guests can read some of Ted Geisel’s stories and take part in facilitated art activities. In theHasbro Games Art Discovery Center, located inside of the George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum, guests can participate in activities that range from arts and crafts to dress-up and puppet play. Inthe Spark!Lab,located inside of the Springfield Science Museum, make projects inspired by inventions and innovations in American history, or invent something totally new.\n\n“Activities can change from week to week in our drop-in spaces, so there are new experiences often for visitors looking to visit more than once this summer,” Garner said.\n\nThe summer schedule also offered the opportunity for more live music at the Museums.\n\n“We’ve had musical performances on and off throughout the years, and they’re always really special events, especially when the weather’s nice and we can have them out on our Quadrangle Green and kids can dance and sing and play,” said Larissa Murray, Director of Education for the Springfield Museums. “But we wanted to make it more of a featured event, something that you could plan for as opposed to it just happening now and again.”\n\nWednesdays are a strong turn-out day for the Museums, Murray explained, making it the perfect opportunity to test out a new music program.\n\nAs a result, the Springfield Museums are offering a “Music on Wednesdays” program this summer, with a different group or performer scheduled each week. The live music begins on July 9 with the Community Music School of Springfield performing Bomba y Plena music from Puerto Rico and West African-inspired drumming and dance.\n\n“Kids can be exposed to styles of music that are perhaps outside of their knowledge, whether it’s African drumming, brass bands, or Latin jazz,” Garner said.\n\nOther bands on the line-up include the GOZA Latin Band on July 16, the Community Music School on July 23, the Expandable Brass Band on July 30, The Airborne Comedians on Aug. 6 and Fiesta del Norte Mariachi on Aug. 13.\n\nAdmission to the concerts, offered from noon to 2 p.m. each Wednesday, is included with Museum tickets.\n\nNew to the Springfield Museums’ summer programming this year is Tinker Thursdays, an hourlong workshop offered weekly in the Museum School. Topics vary each week, but each has a connection to science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics.\n\n“Our team wanted to offer new ways to experience the Springfield Museums for our young visitors and invite them into the Museum School spaces, including our art studios,” said Emma Lewis, Museum School and Lecture Coordinator.\n\nEach Tinker Thursday workshop is led by Museum School staff and is open for ages 7 to 14.\n\nJust some of the Tinker Thursday events on offer include “Doctor for a Day” on July 17, in which young guests are invited to don lab coats and use real stethoscopes as they learn about the heart and how to take a pulse; and “Plush Stuff” on July 24, where young seamsters can create their own decorative pillow and learn how to use a sewing machine.\n\nNo matter what the topic is, no experience is required.\n\n“We hope kids will walk away with a new perspective on the Springfield Mu-seums and the different ways you can learn, as well as a cool completed project and confidence in their new skills,” Lewis said.\n\nTinker Thursday workshops are $10 and $8 for members in addition to museum admission, and tickets to workshops can be purchased on the Museums’ website or in-person on the day of the event.\n\nThe Springfield Museums are open Monday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets can bepurchased onlineat a base price of $25 for adults, $13 for ages 3 to 17, $16.50 for seniors 60 and older and students with ID, and free for children 3 and under.

    "News_title":"Muscle weakness in cancer survivors may be caused by treatable weakness in blood vessels – new research",
    "News_text":"Tumors can destroy the blood vessels of muscles even when the muscles are nowhere close to the tumor. That is thekey finding of a new studythat my colleagues and I recently published in the journal Nature Cancer.\n\nMuscle loss in cancer patients is a major health problem, but the exact causes of how precisely tumors affect muscles remain an active area of research.\n\nScientists in my lab were curious whether one explanation for the muscle loss in cancer patients could be that the cancer impairs the blood vessels that are necessary to supply nutrients and oxygen to muscles. Healthy blood vessels ensure that blood containing oxygen and nutrients is transported from the heart to all tissues and organs in the body, and then circulates back to the heart. Unhealthy blood vessels lose the ability to circulate sufficient blood and develop leaks, with nutrients seeping into the tissue prematurely and thereby cutting off the supply of nutrients to tissues that are further downstream.\n\nTo tackle this question, my colleagues and I worked with several other scientific research teams with expertise in advanced microscopy, cancer research and metabolism. We used animal models to study several kinds of tumors – lung cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer and pancreatic cancer. We consistently observed that the blood vessels in the muscles became fewer and leakier even before the muscle weakness set in.\n\nWe also found that tumors release a protein called Activin-A, which acts on blood vessels to cause the leakiness and, ultimately, loss of blood vessels in the muscle. When we used a gene therapy to restore blood vessel health by counteracting the effects of Activin-A, we were able to prevent the muscle loss.\n\nSo we examined the muscles of patients who had passed away because of cancer and found that the muscles of cancer patients contained fewer blood vessels than expected.\n\nMillions of cancer survivors struggle with muscle weakness, which can be so profound that they may have difficulties walking up a couple of flights of stairs or going shopping for groceries on their own.\n\nSevere muscle weakness and muscle loss during cancer is called cancer cachexia, which occurs inup to 80% of patients with advanced cancer.\n\nRecent research indicates that cachexia is far more common among cancer patients than previously suspected, with approximately half the patients who see their cancer doctor for the first timealready showing signs of muscle weakness.\n\nImportantly, cachexia can persist even after the cancer is successfully treated and cured. This can have a devastating impact on the quality of life for cancer survivors.\n\nOur discovery that the loss of blood vessel function in the muscles occurs early on during the progression of the cancer suggests that fixing blood vessels in cancer patients and cancer survivors could be a new way to prevent or reverse cachexia.\n\nThe reasons for the muscle loss in cancer are complicated and involve poor nutrition due to loss of appetite andinflammation, which are initially caused by the tumor but persist even when the tumor is removed.\n\nThere are currently no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cachexia, but new therapies are on the horizon.\n\nOne such therapy is an antibody drug thattargets the molecule GDF-15, a protein that is thought to suppress appetite.\n\nOther studies are using a combination oftargeted nutritionandexercise programsto help patients with cancer cachexia regain muscle mass and muscle strength.\n\nAll these studies suggest that we will need a combination of approaches to enhance exercise, nutrition, appetite, muscle regeneration and – as we propose – blood vessel health.\n\nWe are now evaluating drugs and exercise programs that are known to improve blood vessel health. Repurposing these treatments that are traditionally designed for cardiovascular patients could be a rapid way to help cancer patients regain muscle strength.\n\nWe hope that our work highlights how important it is for cancer patients to receive comprehensive medical care, which includes improving cardiovascular health and overall quality of life.\n\nTheResearch Briefis a short take on interesting academic work.\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "News_title":"Alleged Marcos Lopez co-conspirator still on the lam month after his arrest",
    "News_text":"When prosecutors announced thearrest of Osceola County Sheriff Marcos Lopez,they said there were five co-conspirators involved with him in an illegal gambling ring. They quickly rounded up all but one of those suspects — a 43-year-old woman a former associate now suspects has fled to China.\n\nMore than a month later, Ying Zhang remains on the lam. She has left behind not only criminal charges but also a tangled web of businesses as well as lawsuits that accuse her real estate firm, Kylin Realty, of defrauding employees.\n\nScraps of evidence that have come to light so far allege a key role for Zhang in the gambling enterprise. Prosecutors have described pages oftext messages between her and the disgraced and suspended sheriff, while state records show a business relationship between her and the manager of the now-defunct Kissimmee casino at the center of the case.\n\nBut other aspects of her participation, and the history of her relationship with Lopez, remain mysterious.\n\nZhang, also known as Kate, owns a 6-bedroom, 6-bathroom home in Dr. Phillips worth more than $1 million and owns four other properties through a company called Kylin Investments LLC, according to Orange County property records. She is a divorced mother of three, according to a former employee.\n\nZhang’s Central Florida business seemed designed to appeal to Chinese nationals. A Kylin Realty video posted on Zillow features cartoon characters and a voice speaking in Chinese with English translations scrolling below.\n\n“We do it all!” the video says, boasting that the company “specializes in property management” while maps of Florida and China appear on the screen.\n\nZhang claimed in letters to clients that she went back to China to take care of her father, but records show the older man lives in the United States, said Mia Cheng, a former employee who won a judgment against Kylin Realty for failure to pay her. It is not clear when those letters were written.\n\nSince Lopez’s arrest, Zhang has also shared videos on Douyin, a version of the social media platform TikTok mainly accessible in China, Cheng added.\n\nProsecutors have offered few details explaining how they determined Zhang was involved in the gambling scheme or how they think she, the sheriff and the other suspects — all of whom have pleaded not guilty — came to work together in an illegal casino operation.\n\nBut public records show two connections between her and Lopez: a $1,000 donation to his 2020 campaign for sheriff and a second $1,000 donation that same year to his campaign manager Julius Melendez, a former Osceola County School Board member who lost his last election bid in 2024.\n\nZhang was also in business with Melendez at Kylin Realty. A sign on the now closed real estate office in west Orlando lists Melendez, who is not accused of being part of the gambling operation, as a broker, and state business records list him as a “authorized member” of her firm.\n\nZhang has additional legal troubles.\n\nOn Nov. 22, an Orange County judge ordered Zhang’s company to pay two former employees after they filed separate lawsuits seeking unpaid salaries and property sales commissions dating back several years. A week earlier, Zhang, and her firm agreed to settle the allegations of fraud and contract breaches for more than $300,000, according to court records.\n\nThe money remains unpaid, however.\n\nCheng, one of the former employees who sued Zhang and accused her of not paying for nine real estate transactions, told the Orlando Sentinel her $102,163.29 judgment remains unpaid despite a January order to compel the payment and another on June 27 holding the company in contempt.\n\n“I’m in a really bad position right now,” Cheng said. “Should I spend more on attorney fees and not be able to collect any money back just because Kate has transferred all the money out of the company? This is where we are,” she said.\n\n“I’m personally really broke,” she added.\n\nAnother plaintiff, Chengzhi Du, was also not paid the $198,388.13 from the judgment in his lawsuit against Zhang. Attempts to contact Du were unsuccessful.\n\nTina Denham, the attorney who represented Zhang in the lawsuit brought by Cheng, declined to comment.\n\nThe racketeering case against Lopez and the others centers around an illegal casino in Kissimmee called The Eclipse, which prosecutors said wasprotected by Lopez until it was raided Aug. 27and was later a springboard for the operation’s expansion into Lake County.\n\nZhang had many business interests, from real estate to property management to auto glass repair, and was involved in a marijuana dispensary in downtown Orlando’s Thornton Park neighborhood, state business records show.\n\nZhang has not been charged in relation to those businesses. But Cheng said she and other employees were interviewed by Homeland Security Investigations, which was part of the task force that investigated the racketeering case, about Zhang’s other dealings.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is leading the racketeering investigation, and the Office of Statewide Prosecution did not respond to messages seeking information on Zhang’s whereabouts. China does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, so if Zhang is there it is not clear what recourse Florida prosecutors would have to bring her back.\n\nProsecutors cited pages of text messages between Lopez and Zhang during a bond hearing for Lopez, saying those messages detail their collaboration in the illegal scheme. But those messages have not been released as they are part of a 255-page affidavit laying out the evidence against the suspects that remains under seal.\n\nThat could change, however, as it was included among a list of materials furnished to defense attorneys in the discovery notice filed this week. The Orlando Sentinel has requested the affidavit and other documents in the case but has not yet received them.\n\nThe discovery notice, the first filed in the case, did not mention Zhang’s real estate business or other ventures. But it did note K&K Amusement LLC, which has Zhang listed as a registered agent and manager and Krishna Deokaran listed as manager, too. Deokaran is the alleged owner of The Eclipse, and other illicit arcades, and prosecutors, during a court hearing, called him an unindicted co-conspirator in the racketeering case.\n\nIt’s not clear what role K&K Amusement — created in September 2021 only to dissolve a year later — played into the alleged gambling scheme.\n\nMelendez, who was named in Cheng and Du’s lawsuits, has told other news outlets he is cooperating with authorities on the investigation into Zhang. But he did not return multiple messages from the Sentinel seeking an interview.\n\nOn June 19, he filed a report with the Orange County Sheriff’s Office accusing someone of forging his name on official documents. Those documents include responses to complaints from the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation dated June 2, Melendez’s report said, days before arrests in the racketeering case began. He said his signature was forged again on documents signed June 5, the day of the arrests.\n\nAn OCSO spokesperson confirmed the agency is investigating.\n\n“This is very alarming since this is a formal complaint by the State of Florida, and I am unaware of how many other documents were signed on my behalf without my knowledge,” said the report obtained from the sheriff’s office. “Someone with Ying Zhang’s knowledge has been using my identity and signatures without my permission. I am willing to prosecute.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kylin Realty, located in the Chinatown Plaza in west Orlando, appears to have been abandoned, though office furniture is visible inside and business hours are still posted on the front door.\n\nThere is only one review on Kylin Realty’s site on Zillow. The reviewer gave it one star.\n\n“Will not recommend,” it reads. “DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!!”",

    "News_text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. (WSAV) — Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced it has filed charges to freeze assets and other emergency relief against Newnan, Georgia-based First Liberty Building & Loan, LLC and its founder and owner Edwin Brant Frost IV in connection with a Ponzi scheme that defrauded approximately 300 investors of at least $140 million.\n\nAccording to the SEC’s complaint, from approximately 2014 through June 2025, First Liberty and Frost offered and sold to retail investors promissory notes and loan participation agreements that offered returns of up to 18% by representing that investor funds would be used to make short-term bridge loans to businesses at relatively high interest rates. The defendants allegedly told investors that very few of these loans had defaulted and that they would be repaid by borrowers via Small Business Administration or other commercial loans. The complaint also alleges that, while some investor funds were used to make bridge loans, those loans did not perform as represented, and most loans ultimately defaulted and ceased making interest payments. Since at least 2021, First Liberty operated as a Ponzi scheme by using new investor funds to make principal and interest payments to existing investors, according to the complaint. The complaint further alleges that Frost misappropriated investor funds for personal use, including by using investor funds to make over $2.4 million in credit card payments, paying more than $335,000 to a rare coin dealer, and spending $230,000 on family vacations.\n\nAssociate director of enforcement for the SEC’s Atlanta regional office, Justin C. Jeffries, said “The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money. Unfortunately, we’ve seen this movie before – bad actors luring investors with promises of seemingly over-generous returns – and it does not end well.”\n\nThe SEC’s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges First Liberty and Frost with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and names five entities that Frost controlled as relief defendants. The SEC seeks emergency relief, including an order freezing assets, appointing a receiver over the entities, and granting an accounting and expedited discovery. The SEC also seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against the defendants, a conduct-based injunction against Frost, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against the defendants and relief defendants.\n\nWithout admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants and relief defendants consented to the SEC’s requested emergency and permanent relief, with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(It remains to be seen if he actually does.)\n\n“But hard to overstate the infighting happening over this the last few days as Maga anger has not let up,” Kaitlan Collins, CNN’s chief White House correspondent wrote on X.\n\nMr Bongino apparently also did not go into the office on Friday following an argument with the Pam Bondi, the attorney general, leading insiders to think he had quit.\n\nHe has come under fire for failing to release a tranche of evidence relating to the paedophile financier.\n\nTensions within Mr Trump’s Maga basethreatened to boil over this weekafter the justice department and FBI concluded Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan prison cell in 2019, and did not maintain a “client list” of potential blackmail targets.\n\nSources told Axios that Mr Bongino had grown increasingly unhappy with Ms Bondi for overpromising to release a “client list” that she has since claimed never existed, saying she misspoke when referring to the list in a Fox News interview.\n\nDuring a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the attorney general allegedly confronted Mr Bongino about a NewsNation article that claimed he andKash Patel, the FBI director, had been prevented from releasing as much information about Epstein as they would have liked.\n\nThe pair are said to have had a “heated” argument in front of Mr Patel, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and Taylor Budowich, the deputy chief of staff, during which Mr Bongino denied leaking to the press.\n\n“Pam said her piece. Dan said his piece. It didn’t end on friendly terms,” one person briefed on the heated discussion told Axios, adding that Mr Bongino left the meeting angry.\n\nMr Bongino, a former US Secret Service agent turned podcast host, has come in for a hammering from Maga supporters after claiming avideo taken from outside Epstein’s cellproved that no one had entered, and that he therefore took his own life.\n\nA conspiracy theory believed by some within the Maga movement is that Epstein was murdered to prevent the names of high-profile associatesbeing made public.\n\nIt is also rumoured that a “list” detailing these associates exists and was to bereleased by the Trump administration. The White House insists such a list does not exist.\n\nCredit: Rumble \/ The Dan Bongino Show | Fox News\n\nThe justice department and FBI on Monday released the 11-hour video in an effort to dispel rumours that the sex offender was murdered, but Maga hardliners noticed time stamps on the video skipped from 11.58pm to midnight, leading some to suspect foul play had taken place during what has been called the “missing minute”.\n\nThe discovery of the “missing minute”, caused by a lag when the surveillance system resets each evening, was blamed internally on Mr Bongino for his oversight, insiders told Axios.\n\nDespite the DoJ presenting it as “raw” footage, it has since been claimed the video was likely modified using a professional editing tool, according to Metadata analysis by Wired.\n\n“The fact is, Dan was for releasing the information with the video and had no problem until he got heat online,” a senior administration official told the news outlet.\n\n“Bongino found the video with the missing minute. He vouched for it after a ‘thorough review,’” he said, “and he thought this would end the matter. When that didn’t work, he lost his mind and ran out of DC”.\n\nThe White House blow up is the clearest sign yet of turmoil within the administration over itshandling of the Epstein files, and raises the prospect of potential sackings.\n\nOne Bongino supporter told Axios: “Dan is not the bad guy here. He shouldn’t take the fall.”\n\nIt comes as Maga firebrandLaura Loomerclaimed Mr Bongino was “seriously thinking about resigning”. He has not commented on Ms Loomer’s claims.\n\nMs Loomer, also wrote on X that Mr Bongino and Mr Patel were “furious” with Ms Bondi over her “lack of transparency” and called for the attorney general to be fired.\n\nOn Friday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, sought to quell rumours of a split, writing on X that he “worked closely with Patel and Bongino on the joint FBI and DoJ memo regarding the Epstein files”.\n\n“All of us signed off on the contents of the memo and the conclusions stated in the memo,” he said. “The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo’s composition and release is patently false.”\n\nMr Bongino was contacted for comment.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nThis story was updated on July 11, 2025, at 4:35 pm ET.\n\nWorking in government, especially in national defense or the intelligence community, can be an unsettling business. You must give up a few of your rights and a lot of your privacy in order to remain a trustworthy public servant. The higher your level of clearance to access sensitive information, the more privacy you cede—and sometimes, as those of us who have been through the process can affirm, you find yourself with an investigator from your agency’s security office, explaining the embarrassing details of your finances or your emotional stability, and even answering some squirm-inducing questions about your love life.\n\nThat’s part of the job, and federal employees submit to it in order to keep America safe. Whatisn’tpart of the job is a McCarthyist political-loyalty requirement, enforced with polygraphs and internal snooping. But FBI Director Kash Patel and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard have apparently decided that hunting down politically unreliable members of America’s intelligence and law-enforcement communities is more important than catching enemy spies, terrorists, or bank robbers.\n\nIndeed, to call what Patel and Gabbard are doing “McCarthyism” is to make too grandiose a comparison.Tail Gunner Joe, a thoroughly reprehensible opportunist, claimed that he was rooting out Communists loyal to Moscow who were hidden in the U.S. government. Patel and Gabbard, meanwhile, don’t seem very worried about foreign influences and they’re not looking for enemy agents. They just want to know who’s talking smack behind their back.\n\nGabbard, according toThe Washington Post, has “expressed a desire to gainaccessto emails and chat logs of the largest U.S. spy agencies with the aim of using artificial intelligence tools to ferret out what the administration deems as efforts to undermine its agenda.” In other words, Gabbard is threatening to endanger the careers of loyal intelligence officers by asking an AI if any of them aren’t fully on board with the MAGA cause. She hascreateda team within her office with the anodyne name of the “Director’s Initiatives Group,” which will collect large amounts of data from across 18 different agencies and run them through AI tools to see whether anyone is engaging in “weaponization” of intelligence. This is a flatly ridiculous, and extremely dangerous, idea.\n\nFor one thing, separate agencies rely on separate systems and different levels of classification precisely to keep data compartmentalized and thus to stop an enemy from ever getting all the pieces of any intelligence puzzle all at once. These various agencies limit discussions, even within their own walls, to small groups who are working from shared context and must be able to speak and argue candidly. Each part of the intelligence community shares information with other organizations only as needed in order to bring in more expertise or to gain better insight across agencies.\n\nIn other words, the entire system is set up exactly to prevent someone from doing what Gabbard wants to do: gather lots of material from many agencies, dump it all in the same hopper, and then let people (or an AI) trawl through it looking for anything that seems interesting. Perhaps in a national emergency, such as a massive data breach or the discovery of a highly destructive espionage operation, a full-spectrum search might make some sense, especially if it were conducted by experienced professionals who knew what they were looking for. Instead, Gabbard just wants to see if anyone is slagging the president’s agenda.\n\nI can almost guarantee that in agencies with thousands of people, someone has written an unwise email expressing bewilderment or disagreement or anger with the president’s policies. It happens under every commander in chief; I saw many during my years working for the Defense Department. What does Gabbard intend to do if she finds such emails? Fire some veteran spies and analysts, corrode morale, and potentially create more security risks, just because someone griped about Ukraine or the One Big Beautiful Bill?\n\nGabbard’s efforts, however, look almost noble next to the frantic paranoia that seems to have overtaken the office of FBI Director Kash Patel, who is subjecting FBI personnel to the humiliation of being attached to a lie detector just to see if they’ve said something bad, not about MAGA or Trump, but abouthim, personally. “In interviews andpolygraph tests,” according toThe New York Times, “the FBI has asked senior employees whether they have said anything negative about Mr. Patel.” In particular, sources told theTimes, Patel wants to know who leaked the director’s request to be issued a service weapon, which is not something usually given to personnel who are not trained FBI agents.\n\nIronically, polygraphs probably won’t help Patel much.Polygraph machines, despite the lore, don’t really detect lies. They detectstress, which is why honest but nervous people sometimes fail theirexaminations, while smooth, sociopathic liars pass them. Some agencies routinely require such tests, and their efficacy is debatable. (Their results are not usually admissible as evidence in U.S. courts.) Perhaps in the right hands, they could be one of many tools to root out someone who may be hiding something that could injure American national security. Federal-clearance holders accept their use as routine, if unpleasant.\n\nBut to be strapped into a chair that measures your heartbeat and your breathing and other biological data, told that your answers could end your career, and then asked if you’ve ever said something bad about the boss—well, that’s almost certainly going to elicit a stress reaction from just about anyone, even the most aboveboard agents and personnel.\n\nPatel’s snippy anger is likely driven by a suspicion that real FBI agents are laughing at him behind his back. But his solution is more than just egocentric lashing out; it’s paranoid authoritarianism. Sending loyalists to hunt for the regime’s critics within the secret services is old-style KGB stuff. All the FBI needs now to complete ascenefrom, say,The Death of Stalin, is for Patel to run down the hallways shouting, “I have documents on all of you!”\n\nGabbard, Patel, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth were always the unholy trinity of utterly unqualified nominees, people put up for their jobs primarily because Trump and his advisers knew that they would be completely pliant and obsequious, that nominating them would horrify official Washington, and that Senate Republicans would have to bend their collective knee by confirming them. But while Gabbard is thumbing through emails and posts, and Patel is examining heart rhythms to see who’s been rolling their eyes at him, America is in peril. Real spies are out there trying to steal America’s secrets; real terrorists, foreign and domestic, are plotting the deaths of American citizens. Kidnappers, gang members, organized-crime rings—they’re all out there waiting to be caught.\n\nBut first, Tulsi Gabbard has to find out who doesn’t like the tariffs, and Kash Patel has to find out who snickered at him in the hallway. Priorities, after all.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

    "News_title":"'Exceptionally rare': Dinosaur fossil found 800 feet below museum parking lot",
    "News_text":"Like finding mountains of gold bars below a bank or happening upon a rare piece of art hidden beneath a gallery, a Denver museum that's full of fossils serendipitously discovered -- wait for it -- a dinosaur bone, right under its parking lot.\n\n\"Wow, what are the chances?\" James Hagadorn, a geology curator at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science, told ABC News.\n\nBack in January, the museum found a fossil of a plant-eating dinosaur, believed to be nearly 68 million years old, lying about 800 feet below the parking lot, the museum announced this week.\n\nAt the time of the discovery, scientists were conducting a \"geothermal test drilling project\" to determine whether the museum could use the heat of the Earth underneath the parking lot in City Park, Colorado, the museum said in a press release.\n\nThis dino-mite find, which Hagadorn described as \"quite the cherry\" on top of the project's intended mission, was discovered 763 feet below the surface and was identified as the \"deepest and oldest dinosaur fossil ever found within the city's limits,\" the museum said in a press release.\n\nMORE: New dinosaur species related to T. Rex discovered\n\nMuseum scientists believe the fossil the vertebra of an herbivorous dinosaur -- possibly a Thescelosaurus or Edmontosaurus -- that roamed the region 67.5 million years ago, which is \"just days before the mass extinction that wiped our the dinosaurs,\" the museum noted.\n\nHagadorn said his \"head just exploded\" when he heard the news of the discovery, which has been on display among the museum's collection of more than 300,000 fossils since Wednesday.\n\n\"It was absolutely incredible. The first thing you say is, 'Are you sure? Is this real? Are you playing a joke on me?'\" he said. \"That's like finding a diamond deposit under the world's largest gem store or an archeological site buried underneath the parking lot of an archeological museum.\"\n\nHagadorn noted that this isn't the first time Colorado has seen a discovery like this. Previously, a horn of a Triceratops was found underneath Coors Field's home plate and \"tons of cool fossils\" have been located underneath Denver International Airport, he said.\n\n\"The exciting thing to me is that there's the potential to find more, and that's both thrilling in the sense of discovery, but it's also interesting because these things are good for science, they tell us about our place, they tell us about our ecosystems [and] they tell us how the plane has changed. So it's a win, win, win,\" Hagadorn told ABC News.\n\nEven though Hagadorn said he would \"love to go 750 feet down\" again and see if there are more potential fossils underneath the museum's parking lot, he said that would be unlikely due to the scope of such a project.\n\nMORE: What scientists learned from a well-preserved fossil of this iconic Jurassic-era species\n\n\"In order to go that deep, you've got to dig a very big hole and then hold that hole open either by lining it or making it tapered. If we think about a tapered hole that goes down that deep, that would probably consume all our parking lot and maybe part of the museum too. So boy, it's fun to think about, but I think it's unlikely,\" he said.\n\nHagadorn expressed his hope that the fossil -- which is within the museum's \"Discovering Teen Rex\" exhibition -- reminds people that \"there's lots of geology underfoot.\"\n\n\"The layers of Earth underneath us tell us stuff that's useful, whether that information is from a fossil or a mineral or some water that's flowing underfoot,\" he said. \"Imagine what's underneath your house or mine. Who knows?\"\n\nHagadorn said the museum will have \"tons\" of free admission days for \"everyone to access\" the fossil and anything else within the facility.",

    "News_text":"The James Webb Space Telescope has made yet another stunning discovery to round out three years of space exploration.\n\nThis time, the most powerful telescope ever launched into space uncovered a cluster of forming stars within the \"toe beans\" of the Cat's Paw Nebula.\n\nMORE: NASA detects new planet with temperatures that suggest habitable conditions\n\nThe Cat's Paw Nebula, also known as NGC 6334, is located in the constellation Scorpius about 4,000 light-years away. It is a \"massive\" emission nebula and star-forming region, according toNASA. It is named for its large, round features that create the impression of a feline footprint.\n\nWithin one of the \"toe beans\" of the feline footprint exists a subset of \"mini toe bean-reminiscent\" structures composed of gas, dust and young stars, according to NASA. The Webb telescope'sNIRCam(Near-Infrared Camera) was able to capture a clear image of the forming stars.\n\n\"Three years into its mission, Webb continues to deliver on its design – revealing previously hidden aspects of the universe, from the star formation process to some of the earliest galaxies,\" said Shawn Domagal-Goldman, acting director of the Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington, in a statement.\n\nThe progression from a large molecular cloud to massive stars entails multiple steps, which are not yet well understood by astronomers, according to NASA. The Cat’s Paw Nebula enables astronomers to study the turbulent cloud-to-star process in great detail.\n\nThe process of star formation is somewhat fleeting, according to NASA. As massive young stars carve away at nearby gas and dust, their bright starlight produces a bright nebulous glow, represented in the image in blue.\n\nThe \"disruptive\" young stars have a brief but important role in the region's larger story, according to NASA.\n\nMORE: NASA catches a glimpse of 'city-killer' asteroid before it disappears until 2028\n\nIn the photo, the orange-brown tiers represent stardust, while small patches represent seemingly vacant zones that indicate the presence of dense foreground filaments of dust that are home to still-forming stars, astronomers said.\n\nThe small, fiery red clumps seen scattered amongst the brown dust toward the center of the photo mark regions where massive star formation is underway, according to NASA.\n\nSome massive blue-white stars, such as the one seen in the lower left toe bean, appear more sharply solved than others because any intervening material between the star and the telescope was dissipated by stellar radiation, the space agency said.\n\nAn \"eye-catching\" aspect is the bright, red-orange oval at the top right of the photo, which is likely dense area just beginning its star-formation process, implied by the low count of background stars, according to NASA.\n\nThe Webb telescope launched in December 2021 and began scientific operations in July 2022, according to NASA. With its sharp resolution, it has the capability to peer farther into space than ever before and continues to reveal parts of the universe that were previously unknown by using infrared light observations.\n\nMORE: Astronomers discover repeating radio bursts from distant 'dead' galaxy\n\nThe telescope \"repeatedly\" breaks its own records while also uncovering the unknowns of the universe, Domagal-Goldman said.\n\n\"Whether it’s following up on the mysteries of dark matter with NASA’s nearly complete Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, or narrowing our search for life to Earth-like planets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory, the questions Webb has raised are just as exciting as the answers it’s giving us,\" Domagal-Goldman said.",

    "News_title":"Study Finds Women’s Anger Significantly Decreases With Age—Starting at Midlife… Is That Right?",
    "News_text":"Anger has long beenassociatedwithmenopause. Whether it’s thesimmering irritability of perimenopauseor theoutburstsoften chalked up to hormonal chaos. So it may come as a surprise that a new study suggests the opposite: that women’s anger may actually decline with age, specifically beginning in midlife.\n\nThe study, presented byThe Menopause Society, is one of the first to track how anger and other forms of “emotional arousal” evolve, specifically across the menopause transition. Among the 500 women ages 35 to 55 surveyed, researchers found a significant decrease in anger as participants aged—suggesting that the hormonal rollercoaster may not fuel as much lasting rage once thought.\n\nMore from Flow Space\n\nWhy Midlife Women Are More Likely to Experience This Painful GI Condition\n\nBut the findings also raise important questions: Are we confusing anger with rage? What exactly is causing all of this? And could there be a psychological reframing at play as women grow into themselves and care less of what others think?\n\nWith the study’s limitations in mind, including its relatively small sample size, we spoke with experts about what this research actually means for women, how it aligns (or doesn’t) with lived experience and whether it’s time to rethink what we’ve assumed about anger in midlife.\n\nResearchers set out to explore how “emotional arousal”, specifically anger, changes as women move through the menopause transition. While mood swings, irritability and even full-blown rage are often cited as hallmark symptoms ofperimenopause, this study offers a different perspective.\n\nThe researchers looked at a group of 500 women between the ages of 35 and 55—a range that captures everything from early perimenopause to postmenopause—and assessed how often they experienced trait anger (that’s the kind of anger that lingers as a personality trait, not just a fleeting mood). What they found was that anger didn’t increase with age, it actually went down.\n\nIn fact, women in the older age range reported significantly lower levels of anger than their younger counterparts. And while that might feel a little off if you’ve ever lost it over an unwashed dish or felt unexplainable fury during perimenopause, the researchers point out that this kind of “trait anger” is different from short-term irritability or frustration triggered by hormones, stress or poor sleep.\n\nOne other nuance worth noting is the study makes a clear distinction between anger and hostility. Anger is an emotion—you feel it in the moment. Hostility is more of an ongoing mindset or personality trait, the researchers explained. So it’s possible that while women might feel angrier in bursts during midlife, they’re not necessarily becoming more hostile as they age.\n\nIn fact, the opposite might be true.\n\n“Historically, women’s emotional expressions have been medicalized as hysteria or as an overreaction,”Aleece Fosnight, a board-certified physician assistant and medical advisor atAeroflow Urology, tells Flow Space. “When we use blanket labels without context, we perpetuate gendered assumptions that lead to misdiagnosis, overprescription and dismissal of real concerns. It also reflects a double standard where men are granted social permission to express anger, while denying women the same emotional legitimacy, rather than recognizing anger being a natural human response accessible to everyone.”\n\nEstrogenisn’t just a reproductive hormone; it has powerful effects on the brain, particularly in regions that regulate emotion, such as the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.\n\nThese areas help control mood, stress response, memory and cognition. Estrogen also influences the production and activity of key neurotransmitters like: serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.\n\nWhen estrogen levels are stable, these neurotransmitter systems work more efficiently—which helps support mood stability and emotional resilience. And a decline in estrogen during menopause is also linked to a reduction in emotional reactivity, including anger, says Fosnight.\n\n“There is some data that shows irritability and mood swings often decrease as women move into postmenopause, when estradiol and testosterone levels become lower, but more stable,” she says. “This shift is likely due to the nervous system’s adaptation to hormonal stabilization after the volatile fluctuations during perimenopause.”\n\nWhile the initial hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause often increase emotional reactivity, some women do experience more emotional stability as they move through menopause. This can happen as hormone levels stabilize at their new baseline, rather than the dramatic ups and downs of perimenopause\n\n“I also don’t feel that it is just hormones alone,” adds Fosnight. “With age comes wisdom. This leads to increased emotional insight, refined coping skills and shifts in identity and values. Women in midlife may develop more emotional distance from stressors, stronger boundaries and creation of a deeper sense of self, all of which can reduce anger and reactivity.”\n\nFor decades, menopause has been framed in medical literature, and pop culture, as a time of emotional volatility, with anger often leading the charge. Women are depicted as moody, irrational or perpetually on edge, especially during perimenopause, when hormone levels swing unpredictably.\n\n“We need to stop pathologizing this natural life transition and start recognizing it as exactly that—a major life transition with both challenges and opportunities for growth,”Dr. Marjorie Jenkins, chief clinical officer at women’s health company Incora Health, tells Flow Space. “We should emphasize that anger and emotional changes are symptoms of hormonal fluctuations, not personality defects. This transition can actually be a time of tremendous personal growth and self-discovery when properly supported.”\n\nReframing the narrative also helps separate anger from hostility or emotional instability, something researchers heavily noted.\n\nAnger is a human emotion. When channeled constructively, it can be a catalyst for change, boundary-setting and even healing. Recognizing this doesn’t mean denying the physiological shifts that can impact mood during menopause—it just means expanding the conversation beyond hormones to include the psychological, social and cultural forces at play.\n\nUnderstanding the difference helps when talking about midlife mood changes or emotional health. For example, many women describe feeling “ragey” during perimenopause—but they’re often talking about sudden, intense irritability that resolves quickly, not deep-seated hostility or a permanently angry disposition. Similarly, someone may feel angry (a normal emotion) without being hostile (a long-term pattern).\n\n“I worked with thousands of women during the menopausal transition and oftentimes [there] are other things contributing to stressors during this time, not just hormonal dysregulation,” says Jenkins. “Labeling women’s experiences as ‘rage’ or ‘mood swings’ without context minimizes the very real physiological changes happening in their bodies and brains.”",

In order to bring their two children along, Ron and Iva bought extra plane tickets and paid $2,000 additional dollars for ship accommodations.\n\nThe Bradley family was very close.According to Richmond.com, Amy and Iva went grocery shopping every week and frequently called each other over TV shows such asMystery Science Theater 3000. Amy was also looking forward to spending time with her brother, a student on break from George Mason University.\n\nWith the cruise ship docked in Aruba, the quartet spent the night of Monday, March 23, together. They attended a Mardi Gras party and a midnight buffet.Per theRichmond Times-Dispatch, Amy and Brad returned to their cabin sometime around 3:45 a.m. Tuesday. But by the time Ron was fully awake at 6 a.m., she had vanished from the cabin balcony. The door was left ajar.\n\nAfter Amy’s parents reported her missing, ship personnel launched a preliminary investigation. The FBI joined the search by the next day.\n\nRon and Iva immediately suspected foul play. According to Iva, two college-aged women on the cruise claimed they saw Amy board an elevator to the ship disco with Alister “Yellow” Douglas, a bassist for the Blue Orchid band onboard, around the time of her disappearance. The teens said Douglas left the disco without Amy a few minutes later.\n\nCruise employeesquestioned Douglasabout Amy’s disappearance and searched his room. He was publicly named a suspect but voluntarily took a polygraph test for the FBI and passed. There was no direct evidence of his involvement, and Douglas was never charged in the case.\n\nAmy’s family has posited she might have been kidnapped and forced into sex trafficking. Two Canadian tourists and a U.S. Navy officer claimed to have seen her at a Curaçao beach and brothel, respectively, in the year following her disappearance. In both alleged instances, she appeared frightened and was accompanied by two unidentified men.\n\nOther theories include that Amy accidentally fell off the ship, died by suicide, or was killed before her body was thrown overboard.\n\nEditor’s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or self-harming behaviors, call or text 988 to get help from the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n\nWith the initial investigation offering few clues to Amy’s whereabouts, her family turned to an outside source in desperation.\n\nIn August 1999, a private investigator named Frank Jones, who said he was a former Green Beret in the U.S. Army, emailed the Bradleys with details of alleged sightings of Amy in Curaçao. He also offered to form a team of ex-Army Rangers and Navy SEALs for a rescue mission, and the family decided to hire him.According to Investigation Discovery, the Bradleys paid Jones a total of $210,000, largely from funds raised by a national missing children’s organization.\n\nHowever, the entire story was a con: Jones never served in the Special Forces and had no knowledge of Amy’s location. He had staged fake photographs of a man and woman on a beach and claimed they showed Amy and an unknown captor.\n\nIn 2002, Jones pleaded guilty to mail fraud. He was sentenced to five years in prison and required to repay the money he received.\n\n“If there’s a chance—I mean, what else do you do?” Ron toldABC News. “If it was your child, what would you do? So I guess we took a chance. And I guess we lost.”\n\nOther sources have come forward with alleged sightings of Amy, including a husband and wifewho claimed to recognize herfrom an episode ofAmerica’s Most Wanted. The couple believed they saw her in San Francisco in April 2003. However, leads from these apparent sightings never resulted in a positive identification.\n\nIn 2010, a human jaw bone washed ashore in Aruba, leading to speculation it could be Amy’s remains or that ofNatalee Holloway, an American teenager who disappeared from a graduation trip to the country in 2005.Dental records quickly confirmedthe bone wasn’t Holloway, but additional testing that might have tied the discovery to Amy wasn’t conducted.\n\nAuthorities declared Amy legally dead in March 2010, even though she has never been found and her body hasn’t been recovered. She remains onthe FBI’s most wanted missing persons listwith a reward of up to $25,000 for information aiding the recovery of her remains.\n\nAmy Bradley Is Missingdirectors Ari Mark and Phil Lott interviewed Ron and Iva Bradley for the new docuseries and were able to examine some of Amy’s former belongings, including her car and duffel bag.\n\n“The more we got to know the Bradleys in the subsequent months, the more two things became abundantly clear: First, that the family’s belief that Amy is still alive was and continues to be unbreakable, and second, that maybe they’re right,” Mark and Lott said in a statement toPeople.\n\nAll three episodes ofAmy Bradley Is Missingbegan streaming Wednesday, July 16, on Netflix.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nNicole Richie’s Surprising Adoption Story\n\nThe Story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Her Mother\n\nQueen Camilla's Life in Photos",

    "News_title":"Archaeologists Uncover Long Lost Tomb of Mayan King of Caracol",
    "News_text":"The mysteries surrounding the life and death of Te K’ab Chaak, the first ruler of the ancient Mayan city of Caracol in Belize, are about to get some answers.\n\nMore than 40 years after uncovering Caana, the central architectural complex at Caracol, Belize, husband-and-wife archaeologists Arlen and Diane Chase have made a pivotal discovery in their exploration of the ancient ruins of Caracol. The couple and their research team have uncovered the burial tomb of Te K’ab Chaak.\n\nRelated: Archaeologists Make Groundbreaking Easter Island Discovery\n\n“The discovery is the first identifiable ruler’s tomb found in over four decades of work in Caracol, the largest Maya archaeological site in Belize and in the Maya lowlands,”according to a press release from the University of Houston.\n\nChaak, who ascended to the throne to become the city’s first king in 331 AD, is believed to have died in 350 AD. Based on what the Chases and their team discovered, Chaak “was interred at the base of a royal family shrine with 11 pottery vessels, carved bone tubes, jadeite jewelry, a mosaic jadeite mask, Pacific spondylus shells, and other perishable materials.”\n\nBased on their findings, the Chases guess that Chaak “was of advanced age” at the time of his burial. He is believed to have been 5’7” tall and had no remaining teeth.\n\nUniversity of Houston\n\nWhile the discovery has allowed researchers to answer some questions, it has also prompted the asking of other queries.\n\n“One question that has perplexed Maya archaeologists since the 1960s is whether a new political order was introduced to the Maya area by Mexicans from Teotihuacan,” Diane Chase said.\n\n“Whether this event represented actual Teotihuacanos in the Maya area or Maya using central Mexican symbols is still debated,” she continued. One thing she does know is that “The Caracol archaeological data suggests that the situation was far more complicated.”\n\nRelated: Archaeologists Recover Stunning Remnants of World Wonder\n\nEven following Chaak’s passing, the dynasty he founded continued on for more than 450 years—making the discovery even more important to tracing the history of the civilization.\n\n“Research continues on the contents of the chamber with the reconstruction of the jadeite death mask and with ancient DNA and stable isotope analysis of the skeletal material,” the statement says.\n\nThe Chases will continue researching their discovery and plan to present the results of their findings at New Mexico’s Santa Fe Institute in August.\n\nArchaeologists Uncover Long Lost Tomb of Mayan King of Caracolfirst appeared on Men's Journal on Jul 11, 2025",

    "News_text":"MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A woman has been arrested after she was found with her daughter’s “mummified” dead body, Memphis Police say.\n\nKimberly Moore, 46, has been charged with abuse of a corpse and failure to report the discovery of a dead body.\n\nAccording to court documents, deputies responded to the Home Inn Suites on Lowrance Road on Thursday. The manager had reportedly asked for a welfare check on Moore due to statements she had made about her husband “owning” the hotel.\n\nCourt documents say that deputies met Moore and were not initially “alarmed” by anything she said or did. Moore allegedly repeated the claim that her husband owned the hotel and told deputies that she was there to make sure the employees were doing their job.\n\nHowever, while talking to her, deputies reportedly “smelled a strong odor emitting from the room.” Court documents claim that deputies asked Moore about the smell, but she acted as if she didn’t smell anything and began to “act strange.”\n\nCourt documents say that deputies checked the room and found Moore’s daughter lying in the bed. Moore’s daughter was reportedly cold to the touch, malnourished, and “mummified.”\n\nThe medical examiner was called to the scene. According to court documents, the medical examiner ruled that Moore’s daughter had been there “for quite some time.”\n\nDetectives reportedly also found flies on her body.\n\nMoore was taken into custody. Court documents say that Moore was found to be “in a state of mental crisis” and was evaluated. Moore reportedly told detectives that her daughter “is still with her” and that God was with her and her daughter.\n\nCourt documents say that Moore was asked if she had slept or eaten, but she refused to answer. Moore allegedly repeated that God was with her and stated that she “reads her Bible.”\n\nDetectives determined that Moore was suffering from hallucinations of her daughter still being alive. Moore was transported to a healthcare facility for further evaluation.\n\nMoore is currently booked in Shelby County Jail East. No bond has been set for her.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Former PEOPLE Staffer Remembers Nephew, 20 Months, Who Died in Texas Floods and Shares Family's Heartbreaking Experience",
    "News_text":"Jordan Vonderhaar\/Texas Monthly\n\nAaron Parsley, a senior editor atTexas Monthlyand former longtime staffer at PEOPLE, was with his family when their house along the Guadalupe River in Texas was destroyed on July 4\n\nAfter the waters receded and they slowly found their way to one another, the family was left to grapple with the fact that while they survived, Aaron's 20-month-old nephew did not\n\n\"This was so hard. But we are strong — and so are you,\" Aaron wrote in an emotional message to his 4-year-old niece in his first-person account\n\nIn a haunting first-person account, a Texas man detailed his family's story of being swept away when floodwaters destroyed their house along the Guadalupe River in Texas. He also shared a message to his 4-year-old niece who survived, while the little girl's 20-month-old brother did not.\n\n“I want you to know how much your family loves you and how much we love one another,” Aaron Parsley, a former longtime staffer at PEOPLE, wrote to his young niece in his story forTexas Monthly, where he now works as a senior editor. This was so hard. But we are strong — and so are you.”\n\nOn the night of Thursday, July 3, Aaron and his family — his husband Patrick, sister Alissa, their 73-year-old dad Clint as well as Alissa's husband, Lance Parisher, and their two children, Rosemary and Clay — ate pizza and played hide-and-seek with Rosemary before the adults played charades and went to bed around 9:30 p.m.\n\nAfter the family got some sleep, Aaron wrote, he heard rain and thunder at 3 a.m., while Rosemary got out of bed to find her dad just before 4:30 a.m. She thought something was on the roof.\n\nAfter hearing Lance call out to his wife, Aaron got up from bed and entered the living room to find his brother-in-law and dad looking out the sliding glass doors.\n\n“We’re in trouble,” Clint said, according to Aaron's account. “Big trouble.”\n\nBuilt in 1987, after another deadly flood, his parents' cabin was secured by concrete pillars a few feet above a 100-year floodplain and about 50 yards from the river on a steep hill. Although Aaron wrote that he'd never been able to imagine the water ever rising that high, the adults soon saw water lapping at the base of their deck and realized they had nowhere to escape to.\n\nDressed and packed with supplies in case they were able to be rescued — a 911 operator hadn’t promised anything — Aaron and his family were in the kitchen when water started pooling under the linoleum. Alissa had both of her children sitting on top of the kitchen countertop when water started coming in through the sliding glass door, which opened before they were able to close it again, Aaron wrote.\n\nThey began to feel the house shifting, before it came apart. Alissa was able to grab a child in each arm, but no one else was close enough to help her — nor did the family know what was about to happen. But before they knew it, they all “plunged into the water.\"\n\nJordan Vonderhaar\/Texas Monthly\n\nAaron was pulled downstream and eventually managed to latch onto a tree. When that one started to break, he luckily found another one.\n\nIt wasn’t until he heard his sister screaming that he realized anyone else in his family had survived, according to his account. His sister had managed to push Rosemary onto a tree branch, but Clay was gone.\n\nAaron shouted words of encouragement — “Be strong for Rosemary!” and \"You have to survive this!” he remembered yelling.\n\n\"Intermittently I could hear just one word—'Clay'—as Alissa cried out for her son,\" he added.\n\nEventually, as the river subsided but the sky remained dark, even after sunrise, Aaron yelled his husband's name and \"for the first time, began to cry—for my dad, for Clay, for all of us.\"\n\n\"Then I noticed Patrick running along the riverbank. I couldn’t believe he was there, fully dressed, wearing his tank top and shorts, his shoes somehow still on,\" Aaron wrote, sharing that somehow his husband only lost his wedding ring.\n\n\"For the first time, I thought we had a shot at surviving. Patrick was the first normal thing since the house broke apart,\" he continued. \"And then Lance came jogging up after him.\"\n\nFilled with relief at their discovery, the two men on dry land still had to wait until the water receded before they could safely get to their loved ones. “For Lance, these fraught moments were the hardest, most stressful part — being so close to his wife and child but not yet knowing how to save them,” Aaron wrote.\n\nThe family later discovered that, like his son, Clint had been able to climb a tree before he was able to swim to shore — and like his son, Clint feared he was the only family member to survive.\n\nJordan Vonderhaar\/Texas Monthly\n\nFinally together again, the surviving family members were taken to a hospital for evaluation. Miraculously, Rosemary was uninjured.\n\n\"In Alissa’s waking, grief-stricken moments, we told her over and over that saving Clay was impossible, that she did all she could. That the flood was in control,\" Aaron wrote. \"In the days since, she has talked about feeling Clay in her arms, and then not having him in her arms.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe day after the flooding, they learned thatClay’s body had been found.\n\n\"According to an official we spoke to,\" Aaron wrote, \"Clay had been found along the Guadalupe near the Rio 10 Cinemas, on Bandera Highway, about a dozen miles from our property. Lance touched his little chest and wiped his blond hair and said, 'That’s my boy.' \"\n\nAt the end of his account Aaron addressed his niece and said he wanted her to know what a special day they’d all shared on the river before the floods struck. After a fun game of hide-and-seek, Clay put his head on his big sister’s shoulder.\n\n“He looked up at you and smiled,” Aaron wrote. “He was, as always, so happy to be by your side.”\n\nWhile they won’t be able to play together again, Aaron wrote, “I know that by the time you can read this, you’ll have had many more adventures and a lot of fun, thanks to your courageous Mama.”\n\nTo learn how to help support the victims and recovery efforts from the Texas floods,click here.\n\nRead the original article onPeople",

    "News_text":"FRANKLIN COUNTY, Ohio (WCMH) — After a few days of collection, donations dropped off at some central Ohio churches for flood relief will soon be on their way to central Texas.\n\n“This is just humanity helping each other,” said Pastor Philip Bassham of Discovery Church in Gahanna.\n\nThe church served as a collection site this week.

Necessities piled up there over the past few days. There were also stacks of supplies by the front door at Discovery.\n\nTPC Food Service on Friday dropped off pallets of cleaning supplies and 13 pallets of water. Noble Cut Distillery, which is right next to Discovery Church, has more equipment and space.

It’s been something that’s provided to us on an annual basis, and so it is a critical time because we are in need of finding a way to cover that lack,” Lovecchio said.\n\nAccording to Lovecchio, the majority of funding comes from individuals in the community and corporate sponsorships. She added that support is needed now more than ever.\n\n“This is a threat that further challenges our position, our field, our industry, and we feel that it’s just critical to local journalism to maintain the support from our community in order for us to continue and to thrive,” Lovecchio said.\n\nYou can help Nashville Public Radio byvisiting its website.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Zohran Mamdani accused of ‘laundering’ defund-the-police past by toying with keeping NYPD Commish Tisch if elected mayor",
    "News_text":"Socialist mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani was accused of “laundering” his vocal defund-the-police stances by cynically toying with keeping tough-on-crime Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner if elected.\n\nThe simultaneous behind-the-scenes and public pushes to keep Tisch comes as many Big Apple elites hope Mamdani — whotrounced former Gov. Andrew Cuomoin the Democratic primary andleads general election polls— cansand off his far-left rough edges.\n\nAnd Mamdani seemingly has been only too happy to keep the door open for Tisch, despite her diametrically opposed stances on bail reform, discovery laws and other public safety issues – all matters for which the socialist firebrand has left a long trail of incendiary tweets.\n\n“He’s laundering his radical stances, that’s what he’s doing,” said political operative Ken Frydman.\n\n“But he needs his defund-the-police voters to turn out again and cop-hating Tiffany Cabán is lurking,” Frydman continued, referring to afirebrand fellow Democratic socialiston the City Council being floated as Mamdani’s police commissioner.\n\nTisch, a well-regarded public servant and billionaire heiress, has tried to stay above the partisan fray, despite a number of politicians trying to use her as a pawn.\n\nMayor Eric Adamspicked Tisch in Novemberto rebuild the NYPD’s standing — and his own — after his first three police commissioners respectively flamed out amidinfighting,scandalandmore infighting.\n\nThe appointment worked so well that lefty mayoral candidate and city Comptroller Brad Lander — who, like Mamdani, had pushed to defund the police —vowed to keep Tisch as commissionerif he was elected.\n\nIndeed, Lander’s move arguably laid the groundwork for hiscross-endorsement allyMamdani’s one-sided political flirtation with Tisch, whose leadership he has praised.\n\nLikewise, Kathy Wylde, who heads the powerful business group Partnership for New York City, confirmed she has recommended to Mamdani that he keep Tisch.\n\n“I believe that it’s premature to make any personnel commitments at this time, but it’s a consideration that is real — and it’s in keeping with the city that we’re fighting for,” Mamdani recently said of keeping Tisch.\n\nBut Mamdani and Tisch would make strange bedfellows, even beyond their respective socialist and billionaire backgrounds.\n\nBefore running for mayor, Mamdani riddled his social media accounts with lashing criticism ofpolice brutalityand cops’lack of accountability to the public they serve.\n\n“There is no negotiating with an institution this wicked & corrupt,” he tweeted about the NYPD in 2020.\n\n“Defund it. Dismantle it. End the cycle of violence.”\n\nAs a mayoral candidate, Mamdaniwalked back his callto defund the police and acknowledged their role in public safety.\n\nBut Mamdani, a Queens state assemblyman, has also been an enthusiastic backer of bail reform, changes to discovery laws and the “Raise the Age” law — all of which Tisch has respectively blamed forrising recidivism,waves of criminals going freeon technicalities andskyrocketing youth violence.\n\n“I will not vote for any budget that rolls back bail reform, discovery reform, or Raise the Age,” Mamdanitweetedin 2022.\n\nWhile Tisch arguably could be a bulwark against Mamdani’s radical impulses, Democratic political operative Hank Sheinkopf said she’d be hamstrung by the fact she ultimately serves at the pleasure of the mayor.\n\nHer role, for now, might actually be providing reassurance for rank-and-file cops, Sheinkopf said.\n\n“Here you have the opponent of [Adams] saying he wouldn’t change the department, but his rhetoric says otherwise,” Sheinkopf said. “Police officers are in panic and they will leave in droves — Tisch is the only way to stop that.”\n\nOther insiders argued that Mamdani actually risks more by keeping Tisch around.\n\n“Mamdani will get clobbered by his cop-hating groupies if he retains Tisch as police commissioner,” said political operative Ken Frydman. “If he doesn’t retain her, Mamdani risks serious crime increasing and getting blamed for the spike.\n\n“Checkmate.”\n\nAdams, for his part, has also tried to capitalize on Tisch’s sterling reputation.\n\nHe recently ran a campaign ad that leaned heavily on Tisch’s comments praising him during an event last weekhighlighting dropsin major crimes across the city.\n\n“Not only did we ignore the noise from the Mamdanis of the world who recklessly called to defund the police, but we doubled down on our support,” Adams tweeted.\n\nWhen The Post reached out to the NYPD for comment, a spokesperson responded with the same words from the commissioner that Adams’ campaign ad used.\n\n“When the critics called to cut funding — he chose to cut crime,” Tisch said about Adams last week. “When the pressure came to back down — he chose to double down. And when others tried to make headlines — he chose to make a difference.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Carl Campanile and Amanda Woods",

    "News_title":"APD releases details of two police shootings in June",
    "News_text":"Jul. 11—The Albuquerque Police Department on Friday detailed two recent police shootings that happened days apart — one that injured an armed robbery suspect and another that killed a woman who took a security guard's gun and fired it repeatedly outside a hotel near Downtown.\n\nDuring an hour-long briefing Friday, APD shared lapel video and photo evidence while giving a play-by-play of the shootings. The incidents were the seventh and eighth Albuquerque police shootings in 2025. Seven of those shootings have been fatal.\n\nCmdr. Kyle Hartsock, who oversees APD's Criminal Investigations Bureau, said in the first incident, on June 16, a detective with the Investigative Support Unit shot 23-year-old Gabriel Moralez from 70 feet away as he ran from officers with a gun in his hand.\n\nThe next day, he said, officers Jonathan Kreamer, Michael Morales and Angel Avalos shot and killed Desiree Herrera, 36, as she fired a gun she had taken from a hotel security guard toward officers at the Hotel Parq Central.\n\nHartsock said during Friday's briefing that the department would not identify the detective who shot Moralez, a common refrain in shootings involving ISU — a group APD says is often tasked with arresting felony offenders. He said it was the seventh time the detective, who has been with APD since 2007, had shot at someone and that the detective was back to full duty.\n\nHe said ISU, like the SWAT team, has always been in more shootings than other units due to the number of interactions they have with suspects in serious crimes.\n\nPolice Chief Harold Medina did suggest ways in which APD is looking to reduce the number of fatal shootings by ISU detectives, suggesting using a police dog to apprehend suspects.\n\n\"I know canines reduce shootings and save lives, and one of the things we're working towards is ensuring that we're able to dispatch a canine with these units,\" Medina said. Earlier this year, an APD K-9 named Rebel was fatally shot, along with the armed suspect he was biting, when officers opened fire during a confrontation outside a motel near the Sunport.\n\nSearch for robbery suspect ends in gunfire\n\nAt 3:08 p.m., officers were dispatched to the Circle K at Coors and Bluewater on the West Side after employees said they had just been robbed at gunpoint, according to a criminal complaint filed in Metropolitan Court.\n\nThe man, later identified as Moralez, left with $140 and \"approximately eight cigarette packets in two gray plastic bags,\" the criminal complaint stated.\n\nISU caught up to Moralez roughly a mile and a half away from the gas station and chased him through a dirt lot as they shouted for him to drop his gun and stop running, according to lapel video. Two sergeants deployed less-lethal 40 mm foam rounds to try to stop Moralez, but he continued to run toward a residential neighborhood.\n\n\"You're going to get (expletive) shot, stop,\" the ISU detective shouted at Moralez. The ISU detective fired at Moralez five times, with one bullet hitting him on his right hip.\n\nAPD provided no photo or video that clearly showed Moralez pointing a gun at police. In a release Friday, APD said the ISU detective told investigators that Moralez \"turned his upper body and extended his left arm out with the handgun toward the direction where the other detectives were approaching.\"\n\nHartsock said a gun found near Moralez had been purchased by Moralez's father in 2017. Officers believe the gun was handed down to Moralez after his father died.\n\nMoralez was transported to the University of New Mexico Hospital, where he stayed for one night before being booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center on charges of armed robbery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment and evading police officers.\n\n\"We're glad our client wasn't killed in this incident,\" Nicolas Corbitt, Moralez's attorney, said in an interview Friday. \"We'll be looking closely at the discovery provided by the state.\"\n\nMental health call leads to fatal police shooting\n\nIt was on June 16 that officers encountered Herrera initially, when she flagged down police in the area of Unser and Interstate 40 to ask for a ride to the hospital, according to a release from APD.\n\n\"At some point during the night, Herrera walked away from the hospital,\" the release states.\n\nEarly the following morning, around 4:26 a.m., officers responded to a disturbance at Hotel Parq Central at Central and Interstate 25. Employees reported a woman in the midst of a mental health crisis, later identified as Herrera, was destroying property in the lobby.\n\nHotel surveillance footage showed Herrera and a security guard get into a scuffle, where Herrera managed to remove a gun from a holster on the guard's hip. Herrera ran out in front of the hotel, armed with the gun, and shot through an SUV parked outside as people scattered from the area.\n\nHartsock played footage that showed officers arriving and Herrera running up the steps in front of the hotel. From the steps, Herrera fires the gun repeatedly in the air as police tell her to stop.\n\n\"She does eventually fire the gun directly at officers,\" Hartsock said. In lapel video, a bullet can be seen striking an SUV police were using for cover before the three officers open fire.\n\nHartsock said none of the officers had been involved in a previous police shooting. Kreamer has been with the department since 2016, Morales since 2024, and Avalos since 2019. Morales is \"not yet back to full duty,\" Hartsock said.\n\nMedina said that policymakers in the state need to fix the mental health system at the state level and he was upset to learn Herrera tried to reach out for help the night before the shooting.\n\n\"Yet, fast-forward, less than two days, and we're dealing with this individual armed out in the street,\" he said. \"Something has to change within the system ... We put our officers and the public in danger and individuals going through mental health crisis lose their lives because they're unable to care for themselves. I'm going to say it, the system is broken. Can our policymakers please fix this at the state level?\"\n\nAn obituary from a funeral home said Herrera \"leaves behind a large and loving family who will cherish her memory forever.\"",

    "News_text":"(EL PASO COUNTY, Colo.) — The Colorado Springs Chamber and Economic Development Corporation (EDC) cut the ribbon Thursday evening, July 11, unveiling a community initiative to participate inProject Civility.\n\nProject Civility originated in Carmel, Indiana, as a grassroots initiative centered around a belief that by cultivating civility in smaller communities across the country, it can expand to everyone.Inspiring positive societal change can only happen if civil discourse takes place first. Once we practice and learn to project civility in conversation, positive change will reverberate from our local communities and extend to the entire nation.\n\n“This has really become a topic of our time because we’ve seen so much, I guess I would say, uncivility, incivility and aggression, you know, within our culture,” said Jim Dutton, a pilot for one of the final NASA space shuttle missions and U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) alum. “So, how do we get back to the point where we can even have hard conversations together with people and still have mutual respect for one another?”\n\nDutton spoke at the event in Black Forest, where he shared how he was able to put that into practice with his seven-person crew during the STS-131 Discovery in 2010–a resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n“I do believe we were a very successful crew in the sense of working well together,” Dutton said. “We were the last seven-astronaut crew on the space shuttle, so after our mission, there were four more. They were all smaller-sized. So we had more people. And yet, as we went through our training, the NASA trainers, we constantly got feedback that people were like, you know, ‘You guys seemed to really like each other.'”\n\nHe attributed some of that to the culture his commander had set, but also their built-in ‘shock absorbers’.\n\n“We’re going to all have things happen where somebody rubs you wrong, but there was, I would say, a group of seven people that had a made a decision that we’re going to work together and be a team,” Dutton said. “It’s amazing what keeping a sense of humor does for deflating tense times and we certainly had some tense times, you know, in training. Times where things went wrong, we made mistakes, people made mistakes and we were learning from it but it was frustrating and you can take it out on each other or you can just own it and try and get better.”\n\nHe said this is something people can incorporate into their daily lives. It all starts with a mindset, and thinking the best about people before jumping to a conclusion, especially when someone wrongs you or cuts you off in traffic.\n\n“Try to imagine the best possible thing for them rather than going down the road of like, ‘How rude, you know, that was.’ So, that’s a helpful mental technique too, right? Is look for the best in other people, assume the best,” Dutton said.\n\nHe added that kindness is contagious, but so is aggression, so stopping it in its tracks before it can spread can make the difference.\n\n“We need people to just go, ‘I’m done with all the incivility in the world right now that we see happening in our culture. I’m going to help turn it around. I’m going to turn off social media and I’m going to go take a positive step to help make a difference,'” said Dutton.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(WJHL) – The Legacy Parks Foundation, a Knoxville-based nonprofit, received a private endowment of $10 million for a playground at Steele Creek Park in Bristol, TN to honor Catherine “Catie” Dunn, a Bristol mother of three who passed away after a long battle with cancer at the age of 30.\n\n“Catherine was a very special lady, and this will really recognize how much she loved Bristol, but also loved family, too,” Mike Mains, Director of the Bristol, TN Parks and Recreation department, said.\n\nSteele Creek Park was Catie’s favorite place, making it an easy choice to house her park, which the Dunn family and Director Mains hope will be the best playground in the state of Tennessee.\n\n“When you look at all the features that Steele Creek Park has, the beauty, the trails, the fishing and various things you can do here, bringing this to Bristol, to Steele Creek Park is really special,” Mains said. “And it’ll be one of the best facilities in the entire state.”\n\nCarol Evans, the Executive Director of the Legacy Parks Foundation, highlighted that the endowment is designated to be used to create a play space for all Bristolians to enjoy.\n\n“The idea is really creating, kind of telling the story of a young woman who was raised here,” Evans said. “And what she enjoyed and make it very, very playful and fun for kids of all ages.”\n\nThe playground will have special features to honor Catie’s life.\n\n“Her favorite color was purple,” Evans said. “She loved daisies.

    "News_title":"A ‘stacked deck’: Citizens’ alternative dispute system unfair to policyholders, attorneys say",
    "News_text":"State-owned Citizens Insurance has sharply increased the number of cases it sends to a special alternative dispute court, but plaintiffs attorneys say it’s unfair because it deprives policyholders of the right to have their cases heard by a jury.\n\nA South Florida Sun Sentinel review of cases handled since early 2024 found that Citizens policyholders are likely to lose if their dispute is sent to this special court, which is run by the stateDivision of Administrative Hearings(DOAH).\n\nAnd policyholders who need Citizens to insure their homes have no way of avoiding the unique policy terms that allow their cases to be transferred to DOAH.\n\nRecords show that Citizens won 47 of 51 DOAH cases that advanced to a final hearing prior to July 10.\n\nCitizens’ board of governors has approved paying $19.3 million to fund the program through 2027 and the company is increasingly relying on DOAH to settle claims disputes. Through July 10, Citizens has sent more than 1,000 cases to the court, compared to about 350 cases sent during all of 2024.\n\nEventually, the company plans to send 320 cases a month, or about 3,840 a year, to DOAH judges through 2027, according to afunding proposalapproved by the company’s governing board last year.\n\nPublic adjusters could become harder to find if new Citizens Insurance payout policy spreads\n\n$50 million pay package for Slide Insurance’s leading executives draws criticism\n\nInsurance costs edge higher for Florida homeowners and condo owners\n\nWhile private market insurers can, in some cases, require alternative resolution methods like mediation, arbitration or appraisal, Citizens, as a nonprofit, tax-exempt governmental entity, is the only insurer in Florida allowed by the state Legislature to require DOAH administration of disputes, if it chooses. Administrative law judges’ rulings are binding, though plaintiffs can appeal them through the state court system.\n\nCitizens claims its use of DOAH saves time and legal costs for both sides, but some plaintiffs’ attorneys counter that the DOAH system — approved in 2022 by the Office of Insurance Regulation and in 2023 by the state Legislature — inherently leads to outcomes desired by Citizens — the source of its funding.\n\nAs a result, Citizens’ right to direct cases to the DOAH court creates an uneven playing field that deprives plaintiffs of their right to have their disputes settled by juries, says Chip Merlin, a plaintiff attorney and founder of Tampa-based Merlin Law Group.\n\n“The fundamental question at stake is whether a dispute resolution process can be considered fair when it is effectively funded and initiated by one of the parties with a direct financial interest in the outcome,” Merlin told the Sun Sentinel. “While DOAH is formally part of Florida’s government structure, its operations in this context are contractually funded by Citizens itself. This setup raises serious concerns about the impartiality of the forum, especially when the insurer prevails in every known case, except two thus far, under this system.”\n\nCitizens spokesman Michael Peltier declined to respond to Merlin’s assertion that DOAH hearings are not impartial. He said that, prior to DOAH hearings, “when we see evidence that supports a finding that the claim is covered, we give the policyholder the benefit of the doubt and pay the claim.”\n\nThat’s happened in 28% of cases sent to DOAH for an average payment of $30,000, Peltier said.\n\nThe company, he said, “does not go to final hearing on cases when we believe the evidence supports payment of the claim,” he said.\n\nIn the DOAH system, a chief administrative law judge is selected by the governor and the state cabinet and confirmed by the Senate. The chief judge is then responsible for managing individual judges who rule on cases.\n\nThe DOAH system was set up to enable Florida residents to challenge decisions by state agencies, and the Department of Management Services that provides administrative support for DOAH has no control over its operations or decisions.\n\nMerlin, who called attention to the lopsided DOAH hearing results in an April blog entry on his website,Property Insurance Coverage Law,told the Sun Sentinel that DOAH judges have no business settling disputes between Citizens and its policyholders.\n\n“The optics alone should concern policymakers and the public,” he said. “The notion that a state-created insurer can fund the tribunal that adjudicates disputes against it undermines public confidence in fairness. This is not simply a matter of appearances. This is about the real outcomes which show up in the statistics. In case after case, the policyholder loses.”\n\nHomeowners who need coverage from Citizens, the “insurer of last resort,” currently have no choice but to accept policy terms that give Citizens authority to send their disputes to DOAH, Merlin noted. Peltier confirmed this, but said the requirement does not pertain to Citizens’ commercial policyholders.\n\nA bill introduced in the Florida Legislature last spring would have required Citizens to allow customers to choose, when signing up for or renewing a policy, whether or not to accept policy terms authorizing either party to send potential disputes to DOAH.\n\nBut the bill died after it was approved by a single committee.\n\nIf plaintiffs withdraw their claim prior to their hearing, Citizens automatically wins and can ask the administrative judge to approve charging them thousands of dollars in attorney costs and court fees.\n\nAnthony Lopez, CEO of a firm called Your Insurance Attorney, with offices in Miami, Orlando and four other states, said that Citizens sends his firm’s cases to DOAH “in every instance they can,” adding, “They have stacked the deck against policyholders.”\n\nPeltier counters that disputes can be resolved much faster by DOAH — less than 90 days, on average — compared to the 620 days the average case drags on in the state court system.\n\nThe shorter case span “means lower attorney fees on both sides, which explains why some attorneys may complain about the DOAH process,” Peltier says.\n\n“Not only does discovery happen quickly, but discovery disputes are resolved quickly,” he told the Sun Sentinel. “This is in contrast to the often months-long discovery disputes that cause cases in circuit courts to lag, attorney’s fees to increase, and payment, when applicable, to the policyholder to be delayed.”\n\nA tally by Citizens officials showed that 50% of 796 closed cases were resolved with policyholders agreeing to accept offers of $250 or $500, while plaintiffs in 11% of the closed cases voluntarily withdrew their claims with no payment at all, Peltier said.\n\nCitizens’ efforts to use DOAH for alternative dispute resolution dates back several years, when private insurers complained that the number of lawsuits in Florida were eroding their underwriting profit, raising reinsurance costs and threatening their ability to remain in business.\n\nIn July 2022, Citizens’ Board of Governors approved allowing the company to modify its policies with a rider that gave Citizens or its policyholders the right to request arbitration by DOAH. Citizens justified the request by saying it would save costs and expedite dispute resolutions.\n\nThen in December, the state Legislature met in a special session that eliminated one of the insurance industry’s biggest cost headaches: the so-called “one-way attorney fees” law that allowed plaintiffs attorneys to collect hefty legal fees from insurers who settled lawsuits by agreeing to spend any amount over their original offer.\n\nRene Delombard, a partner at the firm Vargas Gonzalez Delombard, headquartered in Coral Gables, says enactment of the law ending one-way attorney fees in 2022 should have eliminated Citizens’ need to later seek the Legislature’s approval to send disputes to the DOAH court.\n\nWhen it was brought before the Legislature in 2023, lawmakers should have said, “We got rid of your (one-way) fees … Why should this be put into policies? How does this benefit consumers?” Delombard said.\n\nInstead, the DOAH law was enacted and Citizens’ Board of Governors last year approved the $19.3 million contract to have DOAH’s administrative law judges settle disputes identified when policyholders file notices of intent to litigate with the Department of Financial Services.\n\nUntil recently, Citizens was undefeated in cases tried by DOAH judges.\n\nSince June, three policyholders’ claims were found to be “partially covered” by their policies and two plaintiffs were awarded $19,114 and $17,500. A third received nothing because the judge found that the cost of his loss fell below his policy’s deductible.\n\nCitizens lost another case outright, and the plaintiff was awarded $42,924. The plaintiff’s attorneys are seeking $103,095 in legal fees from Citizens.\n\nOf the rulings favoring Citizens, 13 were issued by William D. Horgan, managing administrative law judge for DOAH’s property insurance claims unit. Until 2023, Horgan spent 14 years defending insurance companies for the firms Banker, Lopez, Gassler and Pennington P.A.\n\nHorgan approved levying court fees and costs against policyholders in nine cases, including five that dropped their claims before their hearings commenced.\n\nHowever, it’s not only former insurance industry defenders ruling in Citizens’ favor.\n\nAnother administrative law judge, Terry Slusher, was a former personal injury attorney before he was appointed as a general magistrate in St. Lucie County in 2010. Slusher logged the second-highest number of rulings favorable to Citizens — 10, and imposed costs and fees against six losing plaintiffs.\n\nSlusher’s rulings were among 16 favorable to Citizens by three administrative law judges who had spent their past careers representing plaintiffs, while 31 pro-Citizens rulings were made by judges who previously worked in insurance defense, state agencies, court systems, or two of the three.\n\nHorgan and Slusher did not respond to emails seeking comment for this story.\n\nA random sample of the 1,389 open and closed DOAH cases reviewed by the Sun Sentinel reveal that many are disputes over the types of claims that Citizens has for years looked upon with suspicion: non-weather water damage, such as pipe breaks that flood kitchens and prompt claims to replace flooring and cabinetry, and roof leaks that plaintiffs say caused water damage inside their homes.\n\nThe records show that Citizens, like other insurers, routinely denies coverage for damage caused by pipe ruptures if adjusters find evidence of slow leaks over time that homeowners knew about or should have known about.\n\nAnd damage to roofs and interior contents is typically only covered if caused by high-speed winds during hurricanes, tornadoes or other severe weather. Insurers have become wary of roof claims that occur months after such events, or result from a roofing contractor’s “free inspection.”\n\nWhen denying these types of claims, Citizens often argues that resulting damage was caused by age, neglect, poor design, inadequate materials or shoddy workmanship.\n\n“These are standard insurance policy exclusions,” Peltier said. “An insurance policy is not a home warranty.”\n\nOnly about 11% of closed DOAH cases advanced to a hearing, Peltier reported.\n\nThe Sun Sentinel’s review of 71 DOAH rulings showed that 20 plaintiffs withdrew after their hearings were scheduled. Their cases went into the books with 47 others as wins for Citizens.\n\nDOAH judges ordered losing policyholders to pay court fees and costs in 30 of the cases, including 10 that policyholders withdrew after hearings were scheduled.\n\nChances for policyholders to prevail in DOAH hearings are so slim that many plaintiffs attorneys either won’t accept cases that have been sent to DOAH, Merlin said. Or, as plaintiffs attorney Michael Fischetti said, they advise their clients to go ahead and accept Citizens’ initial $250 or $500 offers.\n\nThat’s because under the law, failure to accept Citizens’ initial “offer of judgment” places them at risk of being charged court costs and attorneys fees if they withdraw their claim or lose at a DOAH hearing later, Fischetti says.\n\n“An insured is at the mercy of Citizens as to whether they will pursue their fees or not at that point,” he says.\n\nLopez says his clients are served with $500 offers of judgment so they’ll be motivated to settle and avoid the potential of facing large court costs and attorneys fees later. “That’s why you see so many claims dismissed without a final hearing,” he says.\n\nCitizens’ spokesman Peltier said the company has not taken legal steps to collect any of the fees it has been awarded.\n\nDespite requesting — and getting — rulings from DOAH judges imposing attorney fees and court costs ranging from about $2,000 to more than $40,000 against 30 losing plaintiffs, Citizens would have to pursue collection in a state court before losing plaintiffs would be legally obligated to pay, Peltier said.\n\nWhile Citizens hasn’t yet pursued collection in state court, plaintiffs facing fee judgments shouldn’t consider themselves off the hook, Peltier said.\n\n“The DOAH award of fees is legal and valid,” he said. “The bottom line is that we expect plaintiffs to pay attorney fees if awarded by DOAH. To date, however, we have not pursued forced collection through the circuit court system, but reserve the right to do so in the future.”\n\nHe responded that just like in state court cases, “Citizens routinely seeks an award of fees and costs when it is entitled to do so” under a state law that “allows either side to recover reasonable attorney’s fees if the end result is not at least 25% better than what was offered (by Citizens) or demanded (by the policyholder).”\n\nCitizens is among the most-sued insurers in Florida.\n\nSo far in 2025, Citizens has been named as a defendant in 2,478 lawsuits and 1,528 notices of intent to sue, according to state databases.\n\nPeltier pointed out that the number of DOAH cases that Citizens settled with payments represents a drop in the bucket compared to the 142,000 claims the company processed last year.\n\nHe added, “If we do our job correctly, we should continue to keep those numbers low.”\n\nRon Hurtibise covers business and consumer issues for the South Florida Sun Sentinel.

    "News_title":"Former Meadville minister headed to trial on child porn charges",
    "News_text":"A long-time Meadville minister will head to trial on 31 felony charges related to alleged possession and dissemination of child pornography.\n\nIn a courtroom appearance that lasted less than 10 minutes, Timothy Solomon, who resides in the 300 block of Allegheny Street, waived his right to a preliminary hearing before Magisterial District Judge Samuel Pendlino on Friday. As a result, all of the charges against him were automatically held for court and a trial will be scheduled for the November term of Crawford County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nCiting the advice of his attorney, Solomon, 68, declined to comment immediately after exiting the courtroom.\n\nIn the courtroom prior to Pendolino’s arrival, Solomon introduced himself to Crawford County District Attorney Paula DiGiacomo, who returned the greeting and asked Solomon how he was doing.\n\n“I’ve been better,” Solomon replied, “but thanks for asking.”\n\nAs recently as late last year, Solomon served as pastor at Church of the Redeemer Presbyterian Church, 16864 Conneaut Lake Road, and Emmanuel United Church of Christ, 30 Park Ave. At his April 8 preliminary arraignment before Pendolino, he described himself as “a recently retired minister” and said he had been employed by a pizza delivery restaurant for more than four years. A Meadville resident since 1993, he has also long been a familiar face among local theater productions.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation filed charges against Solomon in early April. An investigation began last year after police received a report from Synchronoss Technologies Inc. that images of child pornography had been uploaded to the company’s servers on two days in July 2024, according to the probable cause affidavit filed in the case. Synchronoss is a cloud computing company that contracts with the cell phone service provider Verizon.\n\nInvestigation traced the sources of the images to a phone at Emmanuel United Church of Christ and to Solomon’s cell phone, according to police. The five images all featured nude prepubescent girls, including three in which the girls were engaged in sex acts with an adult male, police reported.\n\nA subsequent search of two cell phones and three thumb drives belonging to Solomon led to the discovery of 25 images of child pornography, including six featuring prepubescent girls, according to police.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Solomon was cooperative during a Dec. 13 search of his home and agreed to be interviewed by troopers, telling them that he views pornography but had never seen child pornography. Had he ever seen child pornography, he added, he would have deleted the images because he was “not into little kids,” according to the affidavit.\n\nThe charges against Solomon consist of six second-degree felony counts of child pornography related to nude images of prepubescent girls allegedly found on his cell phone; 19 third-degree felony counts of child pornography related to nude images of girls allegedly found on his cell phone; one third-degree count of criminal use of a communication facility for allegedly using his phone to possess the images; and five second-degree felony counts of disseminating images of child sex acts for allegedly uploading five images onto the Synchronoss servers from his phone.\n\nAt his April 8 arraignment before Pendolino, Solomon was accompanied by the Rev. Anita Bernhardt, general presbyter and official spokesperson for Lake Erie Presbytery. After the arraignment, Bernhardt said the church had a process in place to respond to situations like Solomon’s.\n\n“This is obviously very damaging to a minister’s reputation,” she said outside the courtroom as Solomon waited to complete required paperwork, “but we have a process that really works.”\n\nOn Friday, Bernhardt was the only person in the courtroom audience besides The Meadville Tribune. As she left the hearing beside Solomon, she declined to offer much elaboration when asked about the church’s response.\n\n“We’re using our process and it is ongoing,” Bernhardt said. “That’s all.”\n\nSolomon remains free on unsecured bail, with conditions including a prohibition on unsupervised contact with any children under the age of 18.",

Thediscoveryis raising new questions about the lives and origins of the fort’s inhabitants.\n\nThe giant leather soles were found at Magna Fort in May among 34 pieces of footwear, including work boots and baby-sized shoes, that are helping to paint a picture of the 4,000 men, women and children who once lived in and around the English site just south of the Scottish border.\n\nEight of the shoes are over 11.8 inches (30 centimeters) in length — a US men’s size 13.5 or greater based onNike’s size chart— making them larger than average by today’s standard and sparking suspicions that unusually tall troops may have guarded this particular fortress at the empire’s edge.\n\nBy contrast, the average ancient shoe found at a neighboring Roman fort was closer to a US men’s size 8, according to anews releaseabout the discovery.\n\n“When the first large shoe started to come out of the ground, we were looking for many explanations, like maybe it’s their winter shoes, or people were stuffing them, wearing extra socks,” recalled Rachel Frame, a senior archaeologist leading the excavation. “But as we found more of them and different styles, it does seem to be that these (were) just people with really large feet.”\n\nAs digging continues at Magna Fort, Frame said she hopes further investigation could answer who exactly wore these giant shoes. A basic sketch of the site’s past is just starting to come together.\n\nWhen the Magna Fort was in use, multiple different Roman military troops and their families moved into the site every few years after it was built around AD 85, archaeologists suspect.\n\nInscriptions on the fort’s walls and altars recount settlements of Hamian archers from what is now Syria, Dalmatian mountain soldiers from Croatia and Serbia, and Batavians from the Netherlands, but the length of time each group stayed at the stronghold remains unknown.\n\nLikely following orders from the Roman army, the troops would often leave the fort for distant regions and in their haste, ditch shoes, clothing and other belongings in the surrounding trenches, Frame explained.\n\nAdditionally, new occupants requiring more space would have built larger structures on top of the existing fort, packing rubble and clay between the walls and trapping any belongings left by the previous tenants, Frame said.\n\n“As archaeologists, we like trash,” said Dr. Elizabeth Greene, an associate professor of classics at the University of Western Ontario. “You get those habitational layers where things were just left behind, maybe forgotten about, and that tells us more about the space.” Greene has studied thousands of shoes collected from the nearby Vindolanda Roman Fort, which has been excavated since the 1970s and is among the most well-studied of the Roman forts along Hadrian’s Wall.\n\nThe recently discovered Magna shoes share some similarities with those in the Vindolanda Fort collection, said Greene, who was not involved in the Magna excavation process, but has viewed the artifacts.\n\nFor one, the soles of the shoes from both sites are made from thick layers of cowhide leather held together with iron hobnails, she explained. While only a couple of the shoes discovered at Magna have some of the upper portions still intact, the Vindolanda Fort shoe styles include closed military boots and open work boots, as well as sneaker-like shoes reaching just below the ankle and sandals with leather fasteners.\n\nIt’s likely that the leather soles of the Magna shoes survived thousands of years in the ground thanks to ancient tanning techniques that used crushed up vegetative matter to create a water and heat resistant coating, Greene said. Testing is still underway to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nThe length of the extra-large Magna shoes suggests the original owners may have been exceptionally tall, Greene said. At Vindolanda, only 16 out of the 3,704 shoes collected measured over 11.8 inches (30 centimeters).\n\nAncient Roman military manuals often described the ideal recruit as being only 5 feet, 8 inches or 5 feet, 9 inches in height, according to Rob Collins, a professor of frontier archaeology at Newcastle University in England. But the soldiers stationed around Hadrian’s Wall came from all around the far-reaching empire, bringing a wide diversity of physical traits to their settlements, he said.\n\nStill, why Magna specifically might have needed troops of towering stature remains unclear.\n\nTo piece together the shoe owners’ identities, researchers will examine the Magna shoes for any signs of wear, Frame said. Any foot impressions left in the shoes could be used to model the feet of the original wearers.\n\nLinking the shoes to real human remains, however, could prove difficult. For one, the Romans near Hadrian’s Wall generally cremated their dead, using a headstone to mark the graves, Collins said. Any bones that remain around the settlements are likely from enemy, illegal or accidental burials.\n\nSo far, the few bones that have been found at the Magna site were too soft and crumbly to provide insight, Frame said, but the team continues to search for new burial spots. Pottery and other artifacts found around the site may also help with dating and matching the timelines of the known occupants, she said.\n\nBut the researchers worry they could be running out of time.\n\nThe 2,000-year-old leather found at both the Vindolanda and Magna sites is preserved by the anaerobic, or low-oxygen, conditions of the soil, Frame said.\n\nThe 34 shoes found at the Magna fort, however, are in worse condition than those retrieved from Vindolanda decades ago — a problem Frame attributes to the changing climate.\n\n“The more our climate changes, the more we get heat waves and droughts, or months’ worth of rain in one weekend type (of) scenarios, the more that influences the underground soil conditions and introduces more oxygen into these environments,” Frame explained.\n\nIn oxygen-rich soil, microbes thrive, contributing to decay, and acidic pH levels erode natural materials like leather.\n\nFrame said the rapid weather changes only make their excavation of Magna more urgent.\n\n“I’m not saying I don’t get excited about the shiny objects and precious treasures, but for me, archaeology is about the story of everybody else … the stories of the people whose lives weren’t written down, who weren’t kings or emperors or famous heroes,” she said. “These personal objects really put the real human people back into the picture.”\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_text":"In this June 19, 2020 photo, members of RISE St. James pray over the graves of what are believed to be formerly enslaved Black people buried on the site of the former Buena Vista plantation. Formosa Plastics plans to build a manufacturing complex on the property. (Photo courtesy Louisiana Bucket Brigade)\n\nCommunity activists with ancestral ties to enslaved people at Louisiana plantations are using a unique legal theory to gain access to an unmarked slave cemetery on the property of a petrochemical company. They claim the company is practicing slavery by owning and controlling the bodies of people buried there.\n\nInclusive Louisiana and the Descendants Project, two St. James Parish environmental justice organizations, joined forces to file a lawsuit against FG LA, an American affiliate of the Taiwanese petrochemical giant Formosa Plastics. One of their primary claims in the lawsuit is based on the U.S. Constitution’s 13th Amendment, which prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude.\n\nAt the center of the lawsuit is a cemetery discovered on a tract of land Formosa purchased in 2017 to construct a massive $9.4 billion plastics facility. The land, located along the Mississippi River in St. James Parish, was once the site of Buena Vista Plantation, where enslaved Africans are believed to have been buried.\n\nFiled in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the plaintiffs want to end Formosa’s control over the cemetery and the individuals buried there. They also claim Formosa has violated the 13th Amendment and Louisiana’s cemetery law by restricting access to the gravesites.\n\nIn 2018, during the permitting process for Formosa’s project, archaeologists discovered unmarked graves on the property. They believe the site is a burial ground for some of the slaves forced to work at Buena Vista before and during the Civil War. When local residents from majority-Black St. James Parish learned of the graves, they began to visit the site to pray and honor their enslaved ancestors, the lawsuit states.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nResidents also sought to halt construction of Formosa’s facility to, at least in part, protect what is now called the Buena Vista Plantation Cemetery. Lawsuits filed several years ago by groups such as Rise St. James and the Center for Biological Diversity, among others, were successful in delaying the project by challenging Formosa’s federal permit. Additionally, citing the company’s refusal to allow access to the cemetery, the plaintiffs obtained a court order in 2020 that forced Formosa to allow them access to the gravesite.\n\nThe new lawsuit makes similar accusations, drawing parallels between plantation owners in the 1860s and the actions of Formosa as a corporate landowner in the 2020s.\n\n“This is an action to enforce rights to access, maintain, care for, and protect a cemetery under cemetery dedication law in Louisiana and to eradicate one of the ‘lingering vestiges of the slave system’ pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution – the continued ownership and control of the bodies of those enslaved under the slavery system,” the lawsuit states.\n\nIn a phone interview Friday, Andrea Armstrong, a Loyola law professor and an expert on 13th Amendment litigation, said such claims are seldom seen in modern cases but are rooted in sound legal theory.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue Formosa’s ownership and control of the graves is a form of the “badges and incidents” of slavery, a phrase that appeared in court cases following the Civil War to describe unlawful actions separate from the institution of slavery but that produced some of the same effects.\n\nOne such action, the plaintiffs argue, was the forced separation of Black families both in life and later in death when they were denied any form of dignified burials. By refusing to record their deaths or allow their loved ones to mark their graves with headstones, slave owners dehumanized Black people, causing what some scholars have called their “social death.” While such acts are different from the forced labor of slavery, they effectively produced the same result by marking people as property rather than humans with individual identities, Armstrong said.\n\n“There are, I think, two potential ways to understand how the 13th Amendment plays out in this context,” Armstrong said. “One is thinking about the harmed community being the people whose slavery status would appear to endure because they are denied the veneration and remembrance that we allow for other communities. And then the other is thinking about the harm occurring to the living descendants today, and the ways that they can’t access [the cemetery].”\n\nPublic reported problems at Atalco refinery long before inspectors found levee breaches\n\nAfter the Civil War, Southern states adopted so-called “Black Codes” that modern scholars describe as laws designed to continue many aspects of slavery but just in different forms, Armstrong said. Among other restrictions, they prohibited Black people from visiting and praying at the graves of their deceased loved ones.The plaintiffs are trying to make the case that Formosa’s restrictions around the Buena Vista Plantation Cemetery produce the same effect as the Black Codes did after the Civil War.\n\n“And like their enslaved ancestors before them, freedpeople were also often prevented from gathering to exercise their right to religion,” their pleading states. “Descendants of the enslaved in St. James Parish have continued to face impediments to accessing and caring for the burial sites of their ancestors, including on former plantation lands now owned by Formosa.”\n\nThe plaintiffs also point to historical records showing some of the enslaved people buried at the plantation were mortgaged for loans even after they died. The pleading notes the plantation owners ascribed a value to and generated wealth from dead bodies in the graves.\n\n“The argument is that these people who were buried there, their slavery status continued after death,” Armstrong said. “We see that through the mortgaging of them as assets and that the inability of people today to access those grave sites in meaningful ways and establish markers is just another indication of how that slavery status endures even all of these years later.”\n\nOne of the challenges the plaintiffs might face with their arguments is that some courts still view the 13th Amendment as an old law irrelevant to modern times because some jurists think of slavery in the strictest form as forced labor.\n\n“We haven’t seen a lot of litigation around: What does it mean to have a badge or incident of slavery?” Armstrong said. “There’s not a lot of case law that provides guidance around this, but we are seeing a resurgence in it right now.”\n\nThat uptick has mainly come from litigation against forced labor in modern prisons, including a pending case in Louisiana over the plantation-style farm labor at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola.\n\n“I do think that this intervention and litigation will provide an opportunity at least to dive a little deeper into the histories of the people who were buried there and certainly to afford the plaintiff some level of discovery and access to prove their claims of connection,” Armstrong said. “So if nothing else, they may learn more about the people who were buried there.”\n\nFG LA turned down an interview request for this report, but company spokeswoman Janile Parks sent an emailed statement. The company is aware of the lawsuit, though it hadn’t been formally served or reviewed as of Friday, it said. The company will “be respectful of the remains and unmarked burial sites” on its property.\n\n“With the oversight of and coordination by the appropriate governmental agencies, FG has followed all procedures in researching and preserving the protected area. FG has been fully transparent and cooperative in giving residents access to the burial site,” the statement said.\n\nWork will continue to move the Formosa project forward, it continued.\n\n“FG is disappointed by the delays the project has faced, but remains confident that all permits were properly issued,” the statement said. “We do not intend to give up the fight for this important economic development project that will benefit the people of St. James Parish and Louisiana.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "News_text":"An archaeologist says he's found the lost city of Atlantis in what would obviously be a groundbreaking find.\n\nThe claim was made by archaeologist Michael Donnellan at the Cosmic Summit 2025 conference,according toDiario AS.He also played a documentary at the summit \"featuring images obtained through underwater technology,\" the site reported. He repeats the claim in the trailerfor that documentary.\n\nHowever,History.comnotesthat scholars aren't sure whether Atlantis was a myth or real; over the years, other theories have pegged it as being at different locations, including Santorini, Greece.\n\nAccording toDiario AS,Donnellan claims \"he has identified three submerged concentric walls carved into the seabed,\" and that \"the dimensions and layout match the city described by Plato in the dialogues Timaeus and Critias,\" describing Atlantis.\n\nDonnellan claims he discovered Atlantis two miles off the coast of Cadiz, Spain,according toLADBible.\n\n\"If anyone had told me six years ago that I would go in search of Atlantis, I would have said they were crazy,\"Donnellan saysin a documentary trailer that he posted on Instagram. \"And yet, here we are. Knowing what we know; not a myth. Not a legend. Atlantis was real. The lost empire Plato described in such precise detail. It actually existed. I have seen these structures with my own eyes. I have touched them with my own hands. These years of field research are about to write a whole new chapter in human history.  They will help resolve those eternal questions of where we came from.\"\n\nCosmic Summit 2025describes itselfas a \"live, four-day event where truth-seekers from 14 different countries and 45 U.S. states came together to learn from each other, having life changing conversations, party and laugh together and challenge what we think we know about human history, earth history, science, and the hidden patterns shaping our world.\"\n\nOther theories have the lost city located in Santorini, North Africa, or Sweden, according toLADBible. Some scholars don't believe Atlantis ever existed, the site also noted.\n\n“It matches everything Plato says verbatim,” Donnellan said of the structures he found underwater, according toLADBible. “He says it came from outside the straits in the region known by the Greeks, 2,400 years ago, as Gades. We know that perfectly well to this day that Gades is the modern-day Cádiz, which happens to be the oldest city in western Europe.”\n\nLADBiblenoted that the structure discovered by Donnellan also has \"carved canals and a rectangular ruin in the middle.\"\n\nAccording toHistory.com, Atlantis was \"a likely mythical island nation mentioned in Plato’s dialoguesTimaeusandCritias\" that \"has been an object of fascination among western philosophers and historians for nearly 2,400 years.

    "News_title":"Eighty years after bomb, is AI a new arms race in Los Alamos?",
    "News_text":"When Pat Fitch started working on artificial intelligence in the 1990s, he concluded it was a waste of time.\n\nIt now takes up a big chunk of his day.\n\nAbout two years ago, Fitch, the deputy director of science, technology and engineering at Los Alamos National Laboratory, said he and other top lab officials started to feel a sense of urgency to get ahead of the emerging technology. The lab invested in AI infrastructure, including installing the Venado supercomputer last year. It started carving out millions of dollars for an AI initiative.\n\n“It’s gone from being useful to being at a scale and impact that we’ve got to get all over this,” Fitch said of AI.\n\nFitch isn’t the only one with AI on the brain. When Chris Wright visited J. Robert Oppenheimer’s home earlier this year, the newly minted federal energy secretary described the nascent technology as a new Manhattan Project. There are distinct similarities: While AI is being welcomed into the Land of Enchantment due to its potential for positive impacts on research, national security and economic development, it also poses risks — much as the World War II nuclear weapons project did.\n\n“It’s hard to overstate the importance and the impact AI will have in defense, in economics, in science,” Wright said at a February news conference in Los Alamos. “This is just very powerful new tools being developed rapidly. We need to win the second Manhattan Project race, as well.”\n\n022025_GC_EnergySecretary01rgb.jpg (copy)\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright speaks to a small group of reporters at the J. Robert Oppenheimer house in Los Alamos in February 2025. “It’s hard to overstate the importance and the impact AI will have in defense, in economics, in science,” Wright said. “This is just very powerful new tools being developed rapidly. We need to win the second Manhattan Project race, as well.”\n\nIt’s a weighty comparison, especially in a state still grappling with the environmental and social impacts of the atomic bomb, which exposed unsuspecting residents of Southern New Mexico to radiation during the Trinity Test explosion 80 years ago — on July 16, 1945 — and caused environmental contamination that required billions of dollars worth of cleanup.\n\n‘Promise and peril’\n\nFormer President Joe Biden described AI in a 2023 executive order as a technology of “promise and peril.”\n\nFitch agreed: “It’s your classic dual-use technology,” he said.\n\nFitch sees promise in the technology. Already, artificial intelligence has helped with everything from material science to seismic analysis, he said.\n\n“That alone would be a big deal, but maybe it’s not a Manhattan Project because it’s a whole bunch of little things,” he said. “If you’re that individual scientist working on seismic signatures, the fact that you’ve never been able to do this before and now you can — that’s a huge deal to you in your field, but maybe it’s not as earth-shattering as the first atomic weapon or discovery of nuclear energy.”\n\nBut uses of AI are expected to grow, Fitch said, and the impacts are not decades away. The potential, in particular, for natural language models of AI — think ChatGPT — will affect every facet of life.\n\nAs it was during the Manhattan Project, the nation is in competition with other global powers. Then it was to get an atomic weapon first; now it is to develop the best AI models first.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly drawn a link between AI dominance and national security; Fitch said the nation remains a hairsbreadth ahead of other countries when it comes to AI development.\n\n“We’ve got all the pieces. We don’t … have the scale yet,” Fitch said. “And I think the sense of urgency is growing.”\n\nNew Mexico Economic Development Cabinet Secretary Rob Black sees promise, too, in the form of job and revenue growth.\n\nGrowing the economies of rural areas is “one of the more difficult things” his department aims to do.\n\n022425_md_layoffs2.jpg (copy)\n\nRob Black\n\n“Rural economic development is not easy,” he said.\n\nBlack sees an opportunity for artificial intelligence infrastructure to jump-start rural communities, pointing to Los Lunas, which has seen major population growth since Meta built a massive data center in one of the town’s business centers.\n\nHe also sees an opportunity for New Mexico, which has a high proportion of Spanish speakers, to correct an industry slant toward language models built on the English language.\n\nBlack is encouraged by New Mexico State University’s June announcement it would offer the state’s first bachelor’s degree program for artificial intelligence.\n\nBut he thinks the state can do more to “lean in” to develop the AI workforce, which, in turn, can benefit other industries in the state.\n\n022525_GC_GovTechDeal01rgb.jpg (copy)\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Lanham Napier, chairman of BorderPlex Digital Assets, in February announce a deal for a multibillion-dollar artificial intelligence data hub and advanced manufacturing center. The Santa Teresa site could bring up to 1,000 jobs to the area and will include microgrid power generation and water treatment facilities meant to attract trade-centric businesses as clients.\n\n“You’re starting to solve very difficult challenges around pharmaceuticals, around cancer treatments, around climate change, material sciences that traditional computing can’t do or hasn’t been able to do,” Black said. “If we’re the ones building those technologies and the workforce to utilize them, we will be leading on those areas as well.”\n\nRising energy needs\n\nReliant on energy- and water-intensive data centers, artificial intelligence poses an environmental pickle. For New Mexico, the challenges are doubled: Not only is the state obligated to fully transition its utilities to carbon-free energy by 2050 under a 2019 law, but it is also mired in drought and battles over dwindling water supplies.\n\nData centers are some of the most energy-intensive buildings; the Department of Energy reports they can consume between 10 and 50 times more energy than the typical office building. And a 2018 report estimated data centers nationwide were consuming more than 400 million gallons of water a day.\n\nTo ride the AI wave and minimize environmental impacts, Black said New Mexico and its industries must continue investing in clean energy.\n\n“We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,” he said.\n\nThat could be a challenge. While the Trump administration has been a bulldog for artificial intelligence, it also has slashed funding for renewable energy and grid reliability.\n\nThe Department of Energy issued a recent report projecting more blackouts across the nation unless plans to shutter greenhouse gas giants like coal and natural gas facilities are halted. That’s because of surging energy demand driven largely by artificial intelligence and the data centers that support them.\n\n“This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,” Energy Secretary Wright said in a July 7 statement. “In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable and uninterrupted power.”\n\n8B9A0013.jpg (copy)\n\nSan Juan Generating Station in August 2024, the day before the scheduled implosion of the four smoke stacks in Waterflow, N.M. The federal Department of Energy issued a recent report projecting more blackouts across the nation unless plans to shutter greenhouse gas giants like coal and natural gas facilities are halted, due to surging energy demand driven largely by artificial intelligence and the data centers that support them.\n\nNew Mexico is already in the midst of its own energy transition. The coal-fired San Juan Generating Station near Farmington was shut down in 2022. The Four Corners Power Plant is scheduled to be shuttered next.\n\nAccording to Data Center Map, an industry tool launched in 2007, there are 21 data centers operating in New Mexico, primarily in the Albuquerque metro area. There are a handful in Northern New Mexico as well.\n\nCamilla Feibelman, director of the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club, thinks there are sufficient safeguards in place to make sure big energy users don’t derail the state’s shift to renewable energy.\n\nGeothermal power is a potential win-win for buildings with high energy consumption, Feibelman said. But she said the state needs to ask the “big questions” before opening the floodgates to AI development — namely, is it all worth it?\n\n“Do those jobs actually appear?” she asked. “Does the existence of AI end up helping society or does it end up harming society? And does powering these facilities put us at a greater risk of failing to meet the moment on the global climate crisis?”\n\nGiven cuts to renewable energy and grid reliability programs at the federal level, she believes the state may have to dig its heels in on making sure the transition actually happens.\n\n“Society hasn’t even been willing to say, ‘we’re willing to do what it takes to curb global climate change,’ much less what the role of AI will be in our society and in our attempts to reduce our use of fossil fuels,” Feibelman said.\n\nWorkforce and resources\n\nEarlier this year, the New Mexico Artificial Intelligence Consortium — a group made up of representatives of the state’s national laboratories and higher education institutions — hosted an industry day.\n\nJen Gaudioso, director of Sandia National Laboratories’ Center for Computing Research and the laboratories’ consortium representative, said companies that attended were especially interested in AI education programs in the state.\n\n“We have to both train our workforce into the capacity to utilize the technology, but we also want to be the place that is driving the development and invention of that technology,” Gaudioso said.\n\nThe consortium is focused on three pillars: AI workforce development, research applications and infrastructure.\n\nGaudioso sees potential in AI in materials sciences and resource management. It could help develop materials to replace persistent and hazardous “forever chemicals,” find abandoned oil wells and bring advances in drug development.\n\nBetween the state’s research institutions and national laboratories, she said the state has some unique resources for AI.\n\nBut there are still gaps.\n\nBroadband access — patchy in rural areas in the state — is an obstacle, Gaudioso said.\n\nAnd, like Feibelman, she said questions remain, including how much of the infrastructure needed to power AI must be located in the state.\n\nFitch, at Sandia’s northern counterpart, said data centers to power AI don’t necessarily have to be located in the same state in which the industry operates. Data centers are typically located near major highways, places where there’s an abundance of water and electricity, he said.\n\n“That’s not a particularly good description of Northern New Mexico,” Fitch said.\n\nPlaying catch-up\n\nState Rep. Christine Chandler, D-Los Alamos, said with two national laboratories, New Mexico is well-positioned to take advantage of artificial intelligence. But when it comes to wrangling the industry, with its high demand for electricity and water use for powerful data centers, the state is far from prepared, she added.\n\n“I think we’re behind,” Chandler said. “There are states across the country now paying attention, and I’d like to see us be a leader in that effort.”\n\nChandler, who sponsored a bill in this year’s legislative session to curb the use of discriminatory algorithms in rejecting or approving New Mexicans for jobs, housing or health care, is part of a group of legislators focusing on the technology.\n\nRegulating AI is difficult work, requiring complicated and technical legislation. Definitions for key terms aren’t currently a part of state statute. House Bill 60, the Artificial Intelligence Act, faced opposition from those who said the bill would stymie innovation in the state. Some lawmakers are unfamiliar with the intricacies of the technology.\n\nUltimately, the legislation failed. But Chandler thinks the state needs to act now, as efforts to resist and reverse regulation on the burgeoning industry crop up around the nation.\n\nA 10-year moratorium on state AI regulations was proposed as part of the nation’s budget bill. Although the provision failed — the measure was overwhelmingly rejected in a shockingly bipartisan 99-1 vote — Chandler said it could be part of a trend.\n\nOne of his first days in office, President Donald Trump overturned a Biden-era executive order on artificial intelligence that established several principles for “responsible” AI development.\n\n062325_md_govpresser2.jpg (copy)\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis speaks at the lectern alongside New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, front left, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, back left, and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon in June 2025 outside of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum to open the annual Western Governors' Association meeting. Polis signed an act regulating artificial intelligence in his state with “reservations.”\n\nCloser to home, a Colorado bill, which New Mexico’s Artificial Intelligence Act was partially based on, was signed into law with “reservations” by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. Despite his signature, the tech entrepreneur and Democratic governor later signaled his support for the proposed moratorium on state artificial intelligence regulation “to give Congress time to figure this out” and create nationwide standards that would overrule state law.\n\nChandler is also concerned about pushing a potentially resource-intensive technology while at the same time cutting funding for renewable energy and climate change research.\n\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory, credited with assisting the Department of Energy in developing report on grid reliability and the growing demand for power, largely driven by AI, is facing a budget less than half the size it was in the current fiscal year.\n\n“The national labs should have a large portfolio of research,” Chandler said. “My concern is that we are going to narrow our focus and simply focus on what appears to be AI and weapons development, nuclear development and perhaps civilian nuclear development.”\n\nAlthough Chandler sees the potential for AI, she’s not convinced the Manhattan Project is the right analogy. She thinks the urgency of climate change, which poses an “existential” threat, is a better comparison to the pressures in the 1930s and 1940s that led to the creation of the Manhattan Project.\n\nFacing down a race to develop the nuclear bomb, the government moved quickly, with few safeguards in place to prevent environmental damage, Chandler said. “We’re still kind of reeling” from the consequences, she added.\n\n“There were a lot of unintended consequences as a result,” Chandler said. “What I fear is all this hype, this excitement around AI could lead us to the same sort of thing. We don’t really fully understand the implications of how it could be used or so forth.”",
