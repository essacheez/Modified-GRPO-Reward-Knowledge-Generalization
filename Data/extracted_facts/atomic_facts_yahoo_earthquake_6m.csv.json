    "News_title":"Tsunami Drones Deployed at Surf Beach in Japan",
    "News_text":"In 2011, Japan was rocked by a 9.0 undersea earthquake and resulting tsunami. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the waves it generated spanned up to 30-feet high before making landfall. Approximately 20,000 died.\n\nOne of the major causes of casualties was that people in certain areas were not alerted of the incoming wall of water. Now, as a preventative measure, Japan is deploying a system of drones to detect potential tsunamis to warn people ahead of time. And specifically, these drones are being deployed in Japan’s surf-rich region of Chiba.\n\nDuring a demonstration recently, according tolocal news, there was “a drone taking off from the town government office and sounding its siren from a height of 25 meters to explain a training exercise was in progress. The drone then began urging surfers to ‘immediately evacuate to elevated land’ while repeating a ‘towering tsunami alert.’”\n\nChiba, both a city and a prefecture east of Tokyo in Japan, is one of the country’s primary zones for surfing. At its Olympic debut during the Tokyo 2020 Games, surfing was held at Tsurigasaki Beach in Ichinomiya, which is in Chiba. The waves, if you’ll recall, weren’t the best during surfing’s inaugural Olympic appearance. However, even though Japan has been known to get some seriously epic waves – seeJohn John Florence’s memorable slab sessionfrom 2011 – and while Chiba might not be the world class, it is perhaps the country’s most consistent and notable surf zones.\n\nRelated: 60-Foot Rogue Wave Captured in Pacific Ocean (Video)\n\nAs for the new tsunami drones, disaster protection expert Michiru Takahashi said:\n\n“The point is to make people aware of danger. We want to create a city where as many people as possible can be saved from disasters, and where no one suffers. We have been working with the keyword of ‘not leaving anyone behind.’”\n\nSo, now you know. If you find yourself surfing in Chiba, and a drone flies overhead that’s not your buddy’s new Christmas present, maybe get to higher ground.\n\nRelated: 20 Years Later: Remembering the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami (Photos)\n\nTsunami Drones Deployed at Surf Beach in Japanfirst appeared on Surfer on Jul 3, 2025",

    "News_title":"Trump tries to sell rice to the Japanese",
    "News_text":"Japan’s attempt to strike a deal with the US before Donald Trump’s deadline next week has hit an unlikely sticking point: rice.\n\nAs part of the negotiations, Mr Trump has revealed he wants Tokyo to buy more American rice.\n\n“Japan, they won’t take our RICE, and yet they have amassive rice shortage,” the president posted on Truth Social this week.\n\nIn a later briefing to journalists on Air Force One, he branded the Japanese as “spoilt” for eschewing American rice, even though “they need rice so badly”.\n\nThe issue has become a major sticking point, jeopardising the prospect of a US-Japan deal ahead of Mr Trump’s self-imposed deadline to strike a deal by next week.\n\n“I’m not sure if we’re going going to make a deal, I doubt it, with Japan,” Mr Trump said. “What I’m going to do is, I’ll write them a letter saying, ‘We thank you very much and we know you can’t do the kind of things that we need. And therefore you’ll pay 30pc, 35pc’, or whatever the number is that we determined.”\n\nAmerica and Japan, which is the world’s fifth-largest economy, share around £140bn of two-way trade. Japan is one of the world’s top 10 consumers of rice, but the country has faced adomestic crisisafter the cost of the crop surged over the past year.\n\n“I have repeatedly stated that agriculture is the foundation of the nation,” Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s economy minister, told a press conference this week. “In negotiations with the United States, our stance remains unchanged. We will not engage in talks that would sacrifice the agricultural sector.”\n\nAs Japan’s lead negotiator, Mr Akazawa is tipped to make another flying visit to Washington this weekend – his eighth – as the two sides try to emulate Britain, China and Vietnam in striking an agreement with Mr Trump’s administration.\n\nIndia, South Korea, the European Union and several south-east Asian countries are also trying to get a deal over the line before the 90-day pause on US tariffs ends on July 9.\n\nRice prices have jumped fourfold in the past year. Heatwaves have hit the harvest, atourist boom has fuelled demand from restaurants, and there have been bouts of typhoon or earthquake-related panic buying.\n\nSince March, the Japanese government has released 300,000 tonnes of rice from its stockpile. But supply chain bottlenecks have prevented buyers from feeling the full benefit.\n\nThe issue has caused anger, which has put politicians under pressure ahead of an upper house election this month.\n\nIn May, Taku Eto was forced to resign as farm minister over the issue, after admitting he never buys rice because his supporters give it to him for free.\n\nJapan has steep barriers to imported rice. Only the first 100,000 tonnes of imported “staple rice” – the most popular variety for Japanese consumers – can enter Japan tariff-free.\n\nAfter that, the rice attracts a levy of 341 yen (£1.73) per kilogram. Another 670,000 tonnes is allowed for use in processed foods or animal feed, a tiny fraction of Japan’s annual domestic harvest, which is typically almost 7m tonnes.\n\nHalf of its tariff-free imports already come from the US. At a government tender for tariff-free shipments held last week, US producers grabbed more than 80pc of the available quota.\n\n“Rice imports from abroad, including from the US, have increased 120 times from a year earlier,” Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan’s agriculture minister, said this week.\n\nThe rice negotiations could stall because Americans produce long-grain rice, and the Japanese prefer short-grain.\n\nAeon, a major Japanese retailer, is trying to woo the Japanese with California-grown rice, and some Japanese restaurants are blending domestic and imported rice.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Credit: Social media\n\nA massive fireball has engulfed a fuel depot in Rome, injuring several people.\n\nFootage posted on social media showed a huge explosion, heard across the Italian capital, and the skyline being filled with smoke.\n\nThe explosion, which took place at a petrol, diesel and gas depot in Via dei Gordiani, injured at least 21 people, including eight police officers and a firefighter, according to reports.\n\nPreliminary reports have suggested a vehicle at the fuel distribution centre accidentally rammed into a refuelling pump, causing a fire and triggering an alarm that sent police and firefighters to the location.\n\nThis led to the main explosion, which occurred at 8am local time and was followed by several smaller blasts.\n\nElisabetta Accardo, a spokesperson for the Roman police, told Italian broadcaster RAI: “There were a few chain explosions after the first one.\n\n“All the policemen injured suffered burns, but they are not in danger of life.”\n\nSeveral cars were caught up in the explosion and police pulled one driver alive from a vehicle that was on fire. The person was rushed to hospital and remains in serious condition, according to Andrea Quattrocchi, a major in the Carabinieri police force.\n\nThree people were left with severe burns and received treatment from emergency services at the scene.\n\nMassimo Bartoletti, an eyewitness, told Rome’s La Repubblica newspaper: “It looked like hell.\n\n“I saw the first explosion with the classic fireball. Shortly after came the second one which was hellish. A fiery mushroom cloud formed in the sky. It shook the whole area.”\n\nOthers thought there had been an earthquake. “We were on the seventh floor, the building started to sway. As if there was an earthquake,” another resident told the newspaper.\n\nFlying debris also damaged multiple buildings in the area and part of the roof was flung more than 300 yards.\n\n“Bits of glass and metal were flying everywhere,” one source told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.\n\nFirefighters were still trying to extinguish the massive blaze as of 10.30am this morning.\n\nCredit: RaiNews\n\nRoberto Massucci, Rome’s chief of police, said: “Unfortunately, it is a very serious fire that seems to have been caused by an accident that happened during the unloading of liquefied petroleum gas.\n\n“Police officers who were on the scene, along with other emergency service personnel, were caught up in the explosion, which was very powerful. They are being treated in various hospitals but luckily none of them seems to have life-threatening injuries.”\n\nGiorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, said she was following the situation closely.\n\nShe has been in touch with Roberto Gualtieri, the mayor of Rome, who is keeping her updated on the fire and the condition of the injured.\n\nPope Leo XIV has said he is praying for the people who have been injured by the catastrophic explosion, which he described as “a tragic accident”on his X account.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Solar stocks’ nightmare year just got a plot twistoriginally appeared onTheStreet.\n\nIt’s been a terrible ride for solar stocks this year.\n\nHeightened interest rates, surprise bankruptcies, and political gut punches have dished out a monumental beating on solar energy plays.\n\n💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵\n\nHowever, if Wall Street’s whiplash this week says anything, this industry still has a ton of fight.\n\nA fresh twist in D.C. has given beaten-down solar stocks a jolt of hope, though whether it sticks is another story altogether.\n\nSince January, the biggest names in solar have been under relentless pressure.\n\nHigher borrowing costs have slammed solar projects this year, leading to multiple bankruptcies from Sunnova to Solar Mosaic. Also, state moves like California’s NEM 3.0 net-metering shakeup compounded sector woes.\n\nThe cracks in the residential and community solar setups were laid bare by essentially gutting resale values.\n\nConsequently, we’ve seen the Invesco Solar ETF(TAN)lagging the broader market by roughly a third, while major players like First Solar(FSLR), Enphase(ENPH), and Sunrun(RUN)are trading deep in the red.\n\nRelated: Solar stocks sent reeling by Congress\n\nThen came the massive policy earthquake.\n\nSenate Republicans slipped into the latest tax-and-spending bill an amendment to phase out all solar and wind tax credits by 2028.\n\nThose incentives include the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit for rooftop systems, and the Production Tax Credits (plus transferable ITCs) have effectively laid the foundation for solar’s economics.\n\nMore on Tech:\n\nVeteran Tesla analyst makes boldest robotaxi call yet\n\nApple could make big change to Siri, delight fans\n\nVeteran analyst offers eye-popping Nvidia, Microsoft stock prediction\n\nWithout them, it undercuts developers’ ability to secure financing while shrinking project returns in the process.\n\nFollowing the announcement, solar stocks plunged. In one brutal session, TAN nosedived about 10%, breaking below $32 while Enphase Energy skidded 26%.\n\nSimilarly, Sunrun stock collapsed 42%, flirting with penny-stock territory, and First Solar tumbled 18%.\n\nHence, Washington’s push to kill off solar incentives has put the whole industry on notice.\n\nA twist on July 1 has thrown the sector a lifeline, though, at least for now.\n\nSolar stocks flipped from panic selling to a surprise rebound in virtually no time.\n\nOut of nowhere, Senate dealmakers decided to scrap that excise tax, which slapped hefty fees on panels with certain foreign parts.\n\nLate on July 1, the Senate signed off on the amended “Big Beautiful Bill,” President Trump’s big tax-and-spend plan. Surprisingly, it excluded the dreaded excise tax on solar and wind projects.\n\nGOP leaders were said to have scrapped it in cooling tensions on the Hill, flipping the market’s mood from panic to relief.\n\nThe bounce was emphatic.\n\nTAN stock led the charge, and individual stocks lit up the tape.\n\nShoals Technologies leapt more than 18%, while Array Technologies added about 11%.\n\nSunrun stock climbed 8.5%, and SolarEdge rose nearly 8%.\n\nSimilarly, Enphase Energy and Maxeon Solar saw roughly 3% to 3.5% bumps.\n\nSurprisingly, even the larger utilities like NextEra Energy, Canadian Solar, and JinkoSolar popped by 2% to 3%.\n\nFirst Solar was the lone laggard, slipping a fraction.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood makes surprising chip bet as AI battle heats up\n\nHere’s the downer: This quick fix didn’t return the long-term tax credits that keep most clean-energy projects alive.\n\nSolar and wind tax perks will still start phasing out in 2026 and will go away by 2028, which means any new project needs to be up and running by the end of 2027 to cash in.\n\nMeanwhile, nuclear got its sweet deal until 2036, and hydrogen hangs on through 2028.\n\nAccordingly, industry leaders aren’t exactly popping champagne, calling the development a temporary respite.\n\nAbigail Ross Hopper, who heads the Solar Energy Industries Association, said this does nothing about the bigger problem. Credits continue to dry up, and there’s still not enough funds to help with local solar manufacturing.\n\nNow, the tweaked bill heads to a razor-thin House vote, which will shed more light on the future of American clean energy.\n\nOn July 2, key solar stocks were firmly in the green during regular trading. TAN is up more than 6.2%, First Solar has jumped almost 9%, and Sunrun is up nearly 3%.\n\nRelated: Tesla stock sinks fast as Musk-Trump clash turns ugly\n\nSolar stocks’ nightmare year just got a plot twistfirst appeared on TheStreet on Jul 2, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported byTheStreeton Jul 2, 2025, where it first appeared.",

The epicenter was 20 kilometers deep, and the magnitude of the earthquake was estimated to be 5.5. Credit - Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Images\n\nEarthquakescan’t be predicted. Scientists agree that precise predictions of a time, place, and magnitude is not possible with current technologies.\n\nYet a years-old Japanese manga thatclaimsa “megaquake”—thoseabove a magnitude of 8.0on the Richter scale—will strike on July 5 has generated panic and deterred some inbound travelers for the past several months.\n\nThe 2021 reprint ofThe Future I Sawby Ryo Tatsuki, a retiredmangakain her 70s, warns that a “huge” tsunami “three times the size” of the 2011Great East Japan Earthquakewill wash over countries in the Pacific Ocean. The first edition of the manga, published in 1999, had referred to a “great disaster” in March 2011 that coincided with the earthquake that killedmore than 18,000 peopleand caused theFukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster.\n\nLast month, Tatsuki appeared to scale back her prediction about a July 5 megaquake, telling the national newspaperSankeithat it may not happen. But she fell short of entirely withdrawing her warning. TIME has reached out to Tatsuki for comment.\n\nThe 2021 reprint has sold more than 1millioncopies in Japan, andsocial media contentthat has racked up millions of views is fueling the scientifically unfounded fears.\n\nIn recent weeks, two Hong Kong-based airlines alone havecut down on flightsto southern Japan due to lower passenger interest. “We are surprised that such rumors have led to cancellations,” the Tokushima Tourism promotion division said.\n\nThe Japanese government has warned about earthquake speculation. InApril, it released a statement that, “predicting earthquakes by specifying the date, time, and location is difficult with current scientific knowledge.” Last month, Japan Meteorological Agency director-general Ryoichi Nomurasaidin a news conference that it was “regrettable that people are being affected by baseless information in this age of modern science.”\n\nJapan has long been a hotbed of seismic activity due to its position in the Pacific Ring of Fire. In August, JMAissued an advisorythat “the likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal” in relation to the Nankai Trough, a 560 mi. oceanic trench to Japan’s south. Earthquakes arising from the Nankai Trough are as the geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A. Hubbard put it, “the original definition of the ‘Big One.’”\n\nEarlier this year, a government panelissued a reportstating that a megaquake along the Nankai Trough has an 80% chance of happening in the next 30 years. Under theworst-case scenario, as many as 298,000 people could die, the report added.\n\nJapan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year,almost a fifthof the global total. The country has spent decades puttingearthquake preparedness plansin place.\n\nGiven the history and frequency of earthquakes in Japan, concern is understandable. But JMA’s Nomura has “strongly” urged the “public not to take irrational actions driven by anxiety.”\n\nJMA remains a reliable source of information about earthquakes in Japan, as are the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the British Geological Survey (BGS), and the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) in their respective regions.\n\nCallum Sutherland contributed reporting from London.\n\nContact usatletters@time.com.",

    "News_title":"Trump’s plan to end TPS for Haitians is hateful. Why aren’t more objecting? | Opinion",
    "News_text":"I, like many of you, try to look beyond the news headlines of horror and try to find the good in whatever the situation. These days, that’s kind of hard to do.\n\nTake for instance, the news at the end of June that the Trump administration will try to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians, citing “sufficient improvement” in Haiti so that Haitians could allegedly return home safely.\n\nWhat a blatant lie.\n\nIt is no secret that Haiti has been a hellhole for many years. So, how did it recover without our knowing anything about it?\n\nHaiti has been roiled by natural disasters — the 2010 earthquake that killed more than 200,000, followed by devastating hurricanes.\n\nAnd the country has fallen victim to armed gangs, who think nothing of torching homes, schools and hospitals, killing and kidnapping the missionaries who risk their lives to bring hope and comfort to a people in dire need.\n\nSome were able to escape the turmoil and find solace, and a new life on these shores. But now, it seems, the solace many Haitians found here for many years is coming to an end. What will they go back to in Haiti? Where will they live? Or work? Or be educated? Or get medical attention?\n\nWhen brutish and armed gangs took over a great portion of the country, the people who could leave were left with no other option but to flee. Over the years, Haiti, a land of majestic mountainsides and colorful creative people, gradually turned into a country in chaos.\n\nIn September, the State Department issued a “Haiti Travel Advisory” warning Americans not to travel to Haiti “due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and limited health care.”\n\nEven U.S. citizens still living in Haiti have been asked to leave the country as soon as possible or be prepared to shelter in place for an extended period.\n\nDoes this sound like a place you would like to return to after having lived and worked and contributed to the economy of this country for many years? The Haitian people have become a part of our American landscape.\n\nMore than 500,000 Haitian nationals are protected under TPS in the United States. If they were sent back to Haiti, we would be left with a great void, especially in South Florida, where their colorful culture has added flavor to the great Mixing Pot.\n\nSo, while Haitians have eked out a life for themselves in many other parts of the country, I can hardly imagine a Miami without the Haitian influence.\n\nLet’s face it, folks — this isn’t about “restoring integrity” to the immigration system. Let’s call it what it really is: A blatant act of racism. It’s hating our sisters and brothers who happen to be from a Black nation.\n\nRecently I heard an excerpt from a sermon by Pastor Loran Livingston, senior pastor at Central Church of God in Charlotte, N.C., who said:\n\n“This is 2025… this is the worse generation, the most, evil generation since the flood of Noah, and it’s getting worse every day…” But, Livingston said, “It is not only society that is rotten, but the so-called church religious people are more like the world every day and are bringing the world into its so-called worship. There is no longer a fear of God in this world and in most churches… The Bible says, ‘… the fear of the Lord is the beginning is wisdom… but the fear of the God is gone. Many Christians no longer have a quaking, respectful fear of the God who saved them.”\n\nI thought about Livingston’s sermon for a while, listening to his words over and over again. And I thought: “This is so true.” I grew up in church. I have always loved a good soul-searching sermon, one where I leave church wanting to be a better person, wanting to reach out to others with compassion.\n\nThis move to send Haitians, many of whom have become Americanized, back to a country that is foreign to them shows a dire lack of compassion on the part of the Trump administration. The move — along with the building of Alligator Alcatraz in the Everglades — makes this generation look very bad, indeed.\n\nThis is where I question the thousands of Evangelicals who support the president’s every move — even when it is the wrong move.\n\nI believe that if the true Bible-believing Evangelicals would stand up and get in a little “good trouble” as the late Congressman John Lewis once said, we would see some good changes happen in our country. People who love the Lord should also love the Lord’s people, including Haitians.\n\nWhile I challenge the Evangelicals to try to persuade President Trump to rethink his order to end TPS for Haitians, I am not “picking” on them. I challenge them because of their staunch support of President Trump. If he listened to anyone, I believe it would be the Evangelicals. After all, many of them carry and promote his “Trump Bible.”\n\nHowever, the burden of compassion is not solely left on the lap of the Evangelicals. As a believer, I know that God is love. He loves the just and the unjust. So, the message to love back is to us all.\n\nI don’t know what can be done to reverse President Trump’s decision to send a half-million people to what could mean their certain destruction. I just believe that none of us can afford to sit silently by and watch it happen.\n\nAfter all — love is what love does.",

Tutdere posted on X that he was being taken to Istanbul. Police also carried out searches at the municipal offices in Adana and Adiyaman.\n\nEleven people, including Karalar and Tutdere, were arrested as part of an investigation by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office into allegations involving organized crime, bribery and bid-rigging. In a statement, it said the evidence against Karalar and Tutdere had been supplied by a businessman who cooperated with prosecutors following his detention for running a criminal organization and paying bribes.\n\nThe mayors had “requested unfair financial benefits from company executives doing business with the municipality,” prosecutors added.\n\nThe mayors' detentions follow the arrests of scores of officials from municipalities controlled by the CHP in recent months.\n\nFollowing their arrests, CHP Chairman Ozgur Ozel convened a meeting of the party’s senior leadership. Meanwhile, the CHP mayor of Ankara questioned why municipalities controlled by President'sRecep Tayyip Erdogan's party were not subjected to the same level of judicial scrutiny as opposition politicians.\n\n“In a system where the law is bent and twisted according to politics, where justice is applied to one group and ignored by another, no one should expect us to trust the rule of law or believe in justice,” Mansur Yavas posted on X.\n\nJustice Minister Yilmaz Tunc condemned “irresponsible accusations that directly harm the impartiality and independence of the judiciary and aim to undermine it.\"\n\nImamoglu, widely considered the main challenger toErdogan’s 22-year rule, was jailed four months ago over corruption allegations.

    "News_title":"News analysis: What Mamdani’s win may portend for Maryland",
    "News_text":"New York City mayoral dandidate Zohran Mamdani celebrates his Democratic primary victory with leaders and members of a number of city labor unions. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago\/Getty Images)\n\nMaryland is traditionally a top-down state politically.\n\nUntil recently, the state’s political landscape has been dominated by senior Democrats, whose centrist, establishment politics continue to hold sway in the State House and in many local governments. Young, aspiring politicians are frequently told, implicitly if not explicitly, to wait their turn before seeking higher office. Even in a state legislature with Democratic supermajorities, progressive initiatives are often held at bay.\n\nSo the pulses of young progressives in Maryland quickened considerably last week when a 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist, Zohran Mamdani, emerged as the unlikely victor in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City and is now the frontrunner in the November general election. And the Democratic establishment and donor class, in the city and beyond, are assessing whether to embrace Mamdani and his movement or continue strategizing for ways to suppress it.\n\n“It’s certainly an exciting moment because it’s a people-powered victory very clearly – an underdog story,” said Montgomery County Councilmember Kristin Mink (D), a leading progressive voice in local and state politics. “Any time we see a number of people engaged and able to defeat big money, it’s important to take note of that.”\n\nIt’s hard to extrapolate much from a single local election – especially one in such a unique environment as The Big Apple, where Mamdani’s principal primary opponent was the uniquely flawed former governor, Andrew Cuomo. But pundits across the political spectrum are calling the primary results an earthquake – and earthquakes can have reverberations far from their fault lines.\n\nAs the 2026 election cycle heats up in Maryland, and as Democrats here and nationally continue to reel from the 2024 election and its profound implications, it’s worth examining whether Mamdani’s message and winning coalition provide some lessons that can be applied here.\n\nA parade — of speakers — and a hint of rain at annual Hoyer bull roast, but no hints on his plans\n\nMamdani’s victory was partly generational and partly ideological. The state assemblyman from Queens had an expansive economic agenda that focused on affordability and the New Yorkers who are struggling to survive in a hyper-expensive city. He highlighted proposals for rent freezes, free transit, affordable child care and government-sponsored grocery stores in food deserts, among others.\n\nMamdani’s thoroughly modern campaign, fueled by nontraditional media outreach, produced an array of responses from Maryland political leaders on social media last week.\n\nLt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), a fellow Indian-American, offered congratulations on X to Mamdani “and everyone who fought alongside him. You stood up for the underdog – and won.”\n\nIan Miller, a 23-year-old member of the Baltimore County Democratic Central Committee who has frequently clashed with party insiders, on Facebook called Mamdani’s victory “the Gen Z Obama moment.”\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. John Delaney (D) offered a more nuanced analysis on X, recognizing Mamdani’s appeal to “base” Democratic voters, but asking, “How do people reconcile the fact that (more centrist) Andrew Cuomo’s campaign was funded by mega donors and he won the low income neighborhoods and (more progressive) Zohran’s campaign was grass roots and he won the wealthy neighborhoods?”\n\nSome national political analysts said they saw Mamdani’s victory as reflecting economic jitters across all classes – and the pent-up frustrations of younger Democrats who don’t see senior party leaders standing up to President Trump and other MAGA Republicans. Do some of the same conditions exist on the ground in Maryland that helped propel Mamdani to victory? Where can political parallels be drawn between New York and the Free State?\n\nLarry Stafford, executive director of the group Progressive Maryland, said New York voters produced results that have already been evident in pockets of Maryland in recent years.\n\n“I see this victory as part of a trend that’s emerging,” he said. “Like a lot of movements, first it goes forward, then it stumbles back, then it moves forward again.”\n\nThere is no question that Maryland is in the midst of a generational shift politically. It began with the departures of Attorney General Joe Curran (D) and Comptroller (and former governor) William Donald Schaefer (D) following the 2006 election, and has accelerated with the retirements of multiterm U.S. Sens. Barbara Mikulski (D) and Ben Cardin (D), the deaths of record-serving House Speaker Michael Busch (D) and Senate President Mike Miller (D), the defeat of four senior members of the state Senate in 2018 Democratic primaries, and the retirements of three Democratic members of Maryland’s U.S. House delegation last year.\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE\n\nThe state made history in 2022 by electing its first Black governor and attorney general, its first female state comptroller and its first woman of color to serve as lieutenant governor – each considerably younger than their predecessors. Two of the state’s new members of Congress, Reps. Sarah K. Elfreth (D-3rd) and Johnny Olszewski Jr. (D-2nd), are 36 and 42, respectively. Brandon Scott was the youngest mayor of Baltimore ever elected in 2020, when he was 36 years old.\n\nWith the swearing in of a new member last month, the 11-person Prince George’s County Council now has five millennials, led by full-throated progressives Ed Burroughs (D) and Krystal Oriadha (D).\n\nFour years ago, there were none.\n\n“I think that’s to the benefit of the county because we have a younger population,” said Councilmember Tom Dernoga (D), who is 66. “I think it’s better that we reflect the population than with older folks like me, and I’ll be retiring soon so I’ll be replaced by someone younger and we’ll be skewing even younger.”\n\nThere have been distinct progressive victories in Democratic primaries over the years in Maryland – some representing significant upsets – though they haven’t necessarily changed the overall political arc of the state.\n\nOne such political victory came in 2006, when constitutional law professor Jamie Raskin ousted veteran Montgomery County state Sen. Ida Ruben in the Democratic primary. Now a congressman, Raskin has since become an icon of the left nationally.\n\nAnother came in 2018, when former NAACP president Ben Jealous, a lifelong progressive activist and Bernie Sanders acolyte, defeated more established Democratic politicians in the primary for governor. Jealous’ victory came on the same night that a 27-year-old bartender named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked a top congressional Democrat, Rep. Joe Crowley, in the New York Democratic primary – so Jealous never quite got his due, especially after losing the general election that year.\n\n“The national landscape never took note of that victory as much,” Stafford said.\n\nThat same year, an avowed democratic socialist, Marc Elrich, was elected Montgomery County executive, narrowly defeating a self-funding multimillionaire in the process – and narrowly beating him again in a rematch four years later. Prince George’s voters recently elected a longtime political outsider, Aisha Braveboy (D), as county executive – though it remains to be seen if she will govern as far to the left as some of her allies on the county council would like her to.\n\nPotential 2028 presidential hopefuls Moore, Walz steal show at South Carolina Democratic weekend\n\nGov. Wes Moore (D) won election at the age of 44, with big ideas to alleviate childhood poverty, create an equitable economy and tackle generational challenges like climate change. But constricted by budgetary challenges, some of his own cautious impulses, and institutional roadblocks in Annapolis, the governor has found that transformational change isn’t all that easy.\n\nStafford predicted that Maryland progressives will take the winning formulas of certain successful candidates, along with Mamdani’s, and apply it to the upcoming election cycle – and to working with allies inside and out of government.\n\n“It will look different than it has in the past,” he said. “The coalitions will look different.”\n\nMink, the Montgomery County councilmember, said she believes progressive policy progress can be achieved more easily at the local level than in the State House, because there aren’t so many powerful forces working in opposition.\n\n“It’s much easier to secure a people-powered win at the county level,” she said.\n\nOne 2026 Democratic candidate who is already making the generational case against a long-time incumbent is Harry Jarin, the small business owner and volunteer firefighter who is challenging 86-year-old U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), the longest-serving Democrat in the House of Representatives. Asked in an interview last week whether Mamdani’s victory emboldens him, Jarin replied, “Hell yes, it emboldens me.”\n\nJarin said that even if Mamdani’s policy prescriptions didn’t appeal to every voter, “he tapped into that insecurity that a lot of younger voters feel and the feeling that establishment Democrats haven’t done anything to address it. It’s voters rejecting the status quo, just as they did in November when they elected Donald Trump. And right now, the establishment Democrats are the status quo.”\n\nHoyer has not yet said whether he will seek a 23rd full term next year, and several elected officials, including some with close ties to the veteran lawmaker, could jump into a race to replace him. But Jarin said he’s ready to pivot if circumstances change without having to change his strategy.\n\n“Even if he does drop out, I expect he’ll try to shove some other establishment Democrat with no real-world experience down our throats,” Jarin said. “To me, this has never been just about age. For me this has always been about the need to reconnect the Democratic Party with the working class electorate it has lost ground with and continues to lose ground with.\n\n“It makes no difference if my opponent is 86 or 31. My message will be the same: We need people with experience away from the political system to serve in office,” he said.\n\nAnother key race where Mamdani’s playbook could come into play is in the Democratic primary to replace Elrich as Montgomery County executive, where Councilmember Will Jawando (D), who is running with Elrich’s endorsement, is almost certain to stake out multiple positions to the left of his principal opponents – who by most standards are pretty liberal themselves.\n\n“The path to success is through people power,” said Mink, who has also endorsed Jawando’s bid for executive. “People are very hungry for electeds whose words, whose actions, whose opinions match the urgency of what’s happening on the ground. There’s important lessons to be learned from New York.”\n\n– Maryland Matters news partnerWTOP Newscontributed to this report.",

    "News_title":"Opinion - Never mind what you heard — the BRICS summit failed before it began",
    "News_text":"The BRICS are falling apart.\n\nThe promising economic group — originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — has increased both its membership and its internal rivalries. And the leaders of Russia and China, the group’s two superpowers,are not expected to attendthis weekend’s Summit in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nChina’s authoritarian government is going through a rough patch, and I’m not talking about the Chinese real estate crisis, its lack of purchasing power, its high youth unemployment, low population growth or theeconomic slowdownthat makes its recent 10 percent annual growth feel like a distant memory.\n\nNo, the new crisis is linked to a strange earthquake prompted by President Xi Jinping, who often disappears for several weeks at a time and announces the renewal of ananti-corruption fightto purge “undisciplined” military personnel or eliminate potential political adversaries.\n\nGen. Miao Hua, vice admiral the People’s Liberation Army, is one of the latest top officials to be purged by the political and military architecture of the Communist regime. Miao was a senior admiral and the director of the political work department of the Central Military Commission, which helps ensure loyalty within the armed forces. Xi’s political maneuvers also affect generals and scientists in missiles, nuclear programs and aerospace.\n\nChina plays adivisive and discordant rolein BRICS. Its ambition for greater power and promotion of its geopolitical strategy against the West has led it todouble the number of BRICSmembers, regardless of factors such as economic strength, political stability or positive contributions to the group. In this pursuit, countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Indonesia, Ethiopia and Iran have joined as new members.\n\nChina has also weakened BRICS through itsrivalry with India. China maintains close political, military and commercial ties with Pakistan, India’s main adversary. Added to this, a silent trade war has deepened, in which China hinders India’s industry, generating tensions between two countries.\n\nThe other BRICS members are not exempt fromchallenges and confrontations. After President Trump’s return to the White House, the so-called leadership of the Global South appears divided and defeated. In April, the BRICS Foreign Ministers’ Summitfailedto pass a joint resolution, unable to reach agreements to promote the integration of Brazil and South Africa as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The meeting was a bust.\n\nThe BRICS conflicts do not end there. Vladimir Putincannot attend Rio in personbecause there is an international arrest warrant out for him for war crimes in Ukraine. Iran and Saudi Arabia are not necessarily best friends; Ethiopia and Egypt have a tense relationship over the Nile. And the list goes on.\n\nThe host country, Brazil, also has its own valley of shadows. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has lost international support due to his radical pro-Iran and pro-Russia stances. Domestically, polls show Lula withonly 28 percent approval. The Brazilian economy is a disaster, with high interest rates that make credit more expensive, reduce consumption and slow growth.\n\nBrazil seeks to promote thecandidacy of a womanfor U.N. Secretary General and, at the local level, Lula has expressed potential interest in a fourth presidential term to “prevent the return of the right.”\n\nBRICS has utterly failed to break the hegemony of the dollar, and the New Development Bank is a white elephant that lacks the resources or financial strength of Western, U.S.-backed institutions such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe BRICS summit has already failed before its launch. Perhaps we can expect some agreements on artificial intelligence, the promotion of renewable energy and a general, watered-down call for dialogue and peace in the Middle East and Ukraine. But there won’t be much more than that — it’s just another brick in the wall.\n\nArturo McFields is an exiled journalist, former Nicaraguan ambassador to the Organization of American States, and a former member of the Norwegian Peace Corps.

    "News_text":"Curious Kidsis a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it tocuriouskidsus@theconversation.com.\n\nHow did cockroaches survive the asteroid that led to the extinction of dinosaurs? – Kinjal, age 11, Delhi, India\n\nWhen the rock now known as theChicxulub impactorplummeted from outer space and slammed into the Earth 66 million years ago, cockroaches were there. The impact caused a massive earthquake, and scientists think it alsotriggered volcanic eruptionsthousands of miles from the impact site. Three-quarters of plants and animals on Earth died, including all dinosaurs,except for some speciesthat were ancestors of today’s birds.\n\nHow could roaches a couple of inches long survive when so many powerful animals went extinct? It turns out that they were nicely equipped to live through a meteoric catastrophe.\n\nIf you’ve ever seen a cockroach, you’ve probably noticed that their bodies are very flat. This is not an accident. Flatter insects can squeeze themselves into tighter places. This enables them to hide practically anywhere – and it may have helped them survive the Chicxulub impact.\n\nWhen the meteor struck,temperatures on Earth’s surface skyrocketed. Many animals had nowhere to flee, but roaches could take shelter in tiny soil crevices, which provide excellent protection from heat.\n\nThe meteor’s impacttriggered a cascade of effects. It kicked up so much dust that the sky darkened. As the sun dimmed, temperatures plunged and conditions became wintry around the globe. With little sunlight, surviving plants struggled to grow, and many other organisms that relied on those plants went hungry.\n\nNot cockroaches, though. Unlike some insects thatprefer to eat one specific plant, cockroaches areomnivorous scavengers. This means they will eat most foods that come from animals or plants as well as cardboard, some kinds of clothing and even poop. Having appetites that aren’t picky has allowed cockroaches to survive lean times since the Chicxulub extinction and other natural disasters.\n\nAnother helpful trait is that cockroacheslay their eggs in little protective cases. These egg cartons look like dried beans and are called oothecae, which means “egg cases.” Like phone cases, oothecae are hard and protect their contents from physical damage and other threats, such as flooding and drought. Some cockroaches may have waited out part of the Chicxulub catastrophe from the comfort of their oothecae.\n\nModern cockroaches are little survivors that can live just about anywhere on land, from the heat of the tropics to some of the coldest parts of the globe. Scientists estimate thatthere over 4,000 cockroach species.\n\nA handful of these species like to live with humans and quickly become pests. Once cockroaches become established in a building, it’s hard to rid every little crack of these insects and their oothecae. When large numbers of roaches are present in unsanitary places, they can spread diseases. The biggest threat they pose to human health is from allergens they produce that cantrigger asthma attacks and allergic reactionsin some people.\n\nCockroach pests are hard to manage because they canresist many chemical insecticidesand because they have the same abilities that helped their ancestors outlive many dinosaurs. Still, cockroaches are much more than a pest to control. Researchers study cockroaches to understandhow they moveandhow their bodies are designedto get ideas for building better robots.\n\nAs a scientist, I see all insects as beautiful, six-legged inspirations. Cockroaches have already overcome odds that were too great for dinosaurs. If another meteorite hit the Earth, I’d be more worried for humans than for cockroaches.\n\nHello, curious kids!

    "News_text":"To the editor: Let us now praise Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nSince arriving in 2006, Govan has overseen the transformation of the 20-acre campus into an exciting and ever-evolving oasis of art and culture in the middle of a city with no real center — until now. Recently, LACMA hosted a sneak peek of its eye-popping new addition, the David Geffen Galleries, over three glorious days. After a difficult year, it was great to see thousands of Southern California residents come together to celebrate this thrilling new landmark.\n\nBut you would hardly be aware that such a special event took place or of LACMA's elevated profile over the years thanks to Govan's leadership and fundraising prowess by following art critic Christopher Knight's coverage (“The new LACMA is sleek, splotchy, powerful, jarring, monotonous, appealing and absurd,”June 27). His articles are filled with more grievances than a Donald Trump stump speech.\n\nKnight states that the building's cost is pegged at $720 million but sources have told him \"the entire project cost is closer to $835 million.\" This, I don't doubt. Ever attempt a kitchen remodel? Try building an elevated 347,500-square-foot structure in an earthquake zone, amid ancient tar pits filled with treasured fossils, during a pandemic.\n\n\"The limitless concrete is monotonous,\" Knight complains of the new galleries. Aren't white walls also monotonous until you hang some art on them? He worries the museum has been undergoing a \"lengthy transformation from a civic art institution into a tourist destination.\" Can't it be both?\n\nI understand that Knight doesn't like the “non-hierarchical” design of the single-story museum. We can all agree to disagree on such things. I just don't think it's necessary to vilify LACMA in every article he writes to make a point.\n\nFinally, Knight writes, \"Will the Geffen Galleries be successful?

In Alfama, the spiritual home of Lisbon’s folk fado music, such encounters can be sought out in tascas — unfussy taverns like the one I’m sat in, where rich stews and meat dishes are served — or more upmarket fado houses, where etiquette is more strictly upheld. “You should understand the difference between the establishments,” another performer, Joana Carvalhas, tells me when we get chatting at the end of her set. “There are places where you may be asked to leave for talking during a performance, where the music is just as serious as the food.”\n\nAt the start of her career, but with the resonant vocals of someone twice her age, Joana represents the next generation of fadistas (fado singers). “Of course, we now perform mainly for tourists, because we want to share fado and preserve it,” she explains, referring to the uptick in interest since UNESCO recognised the genre as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2011. “But at the end of the working night, us musicians still gather, at traditional places like Tasca do Chico or Mesa de Frades to play simply for the love of it.”\n\nIf the nights in Alfama are for fado, the days are for sightseeing. This is the Lisbon of postcards and daydreams, where cobblestone lanes are strung with colourful washing lines, vintage trams rattle around tight corners, and terraced miradouro (viewpoints) gaze out over a jumble of terracotta roofs and church towers towards the River Tagus. “It wasn’t always this popular,” walking tour guide Claudia Flores explains the next day in the shadow of the cathedral. “For centuries, before the gentrification of the last decade, Alfama was a working-class neighbourhood. It was here and in nearby Mouraria, the old Moorish Quarter, that fado — meaning fate — was born 200 years ago, although many trace its roots back much further.”\n\nCentral to fado music, and to the Portuguese psyche, are the ideas of saudade (melancholic longing) and the humbling hand of destiny. It was in 1755, as Lisbon rode high on the colonial riches ushered in during the Age of Discovery, that disaster struck. The most destructive earthquake in European history hit the capital, compounded by fires and a tsunami, levelling all but hilly Alfama with its firm volcanic bedrock. Reconstruction of the city centre was elegant, as anyone who tours the Pombaline monuments of Baixa-Chiado can attest, but emptied the national coffers, paving the way for the repressive Estado Novo regime of the 20th century.\n\n“‘Fado, football and Fatima’ were dictator António de Oliveira Salazar’s three Fs — a cynical credo designed to pacify and control the masses,” Claudia explains, as we arrive at an eye-catching mosaic, a portrait rising out of the calçada (patterned pavement), completed by artist Vhils in 2015. The figure is Amália Rodrigues, Portugal’s greatest fadista, who died in 1999 at age 79. She was the first woman to be interred in the National Pantheon. “I know her from the glamorous photos decorating the local tascas, framed large as if revering royalty or petitioning a saint,” she adds.\n\n“Fado could be subversive, voicing the everyday complaints of ordinary people, so the state moved to regulate singers and their new lyrics,” she explains. “Some bohemians took the genre underground.” But it was Amália Rodrigues who took it to stratospheric heights.\n\nTo better understand the evolution of fado, I’ve come to the arty warehouse regeneration complex of 8 Marvila, three miles up the coast from the city centre. Amid the area’s restaurants and pop-up boutiques, a state-of-the-art, permanent exhibition dedicated to Amália Rodrigues opened in 2024.\n\n“From a humble start in life, she elevated fado to a new dimension — she released 170 records and performed in more than 70 countries,” Louis Brézet from theAh, Amália: Living Experienceshow tells me by way of introduction. “The 20th century was a time when the Portuguese had few freedoms, especially women; when the country was seen as a backwater. Her life, and what she achieved, deserves this level of recognition.”\n\nThe eight galleries flow through large-scale projections, a virtual reality experience and an eye-catching mirrored room. Her poetry — which expanded fado’s established themes and elevated its use of metaphor — pepper the biographical exhibits along with previously unreleased recordings, all weaving together a portrait of a woman, a city and a sound. Even the traditional look of fadistas — the costume jewellery, the fringed shawl, the black dress that’s typically twisted and wrenched during emotional songs — is drawn from Amália’s own style. But while so much of her legacy lives on in today’s performers, it’s still astonishing to reach Ah, Amália’s theatrical finale: a full-size holographic performance by the singer at L’Olympia in Paris at the height of her vocal powers. No expense has been spared on the sound quality in the little theatre; my skin prickles with the raw ecstasy and palpable grief in her expression, as she soars through riffs and pulls phrases from her soul.\n\n“People think of Amália as a sad woman, always in black — but she was a wit with a flamboyant fashion sense,” tour guide Mariana Gonçalves says across town at the House Museum Amália Rodrigues, in the chichi São Bento neighbourhood, where the singer lived for the last 44 years of her life. Behind us, wardrobes burst with colourful, diaphanous gowns; around her bedroom, costume jewellery and handbags jostle for prominence with Catholic tchotchkes. “Faith, fate. Colour, darkness. The drama and contradictions of Amália’s life are a mirror to her time.”\n\nThis museum, run by theAmália Rodrigues Foundation, is a cosy counterpoint to the modernity of Ah, Amália, taking visitors behind the public image, into the time-warp salons where she threw extravagant bohemian parties, or to the sun-dappled back garden where, under the watchful gaze of Chico, Amália’s aged parrot, afternoon fado concerts are staged up to three times a week. My guide also is keen to stress that while Amália’s work was supported by the regime, the feeling was not mutual; quietly, she helped the poor and those in political exile.\n\nMotioning to a grand piano and a bulbous, 12-string fado guitar on display, Mariana says: “Amália never learned to play an instrument herself, but she had an incredible ear, singing in more than five languages. But it didn’t matter if foreign audiences could understand her. She always said: ‘Fado is meant to be felt, not explained.’”\n\nI return to Alfama over subsequent evenings, its fairytale quality only deepening as I roam its knotted lanes and discover — through chance findings and recommendations — much variety across its two dozen fado venues. Some restaurants, I learn, are too cavernous or touristy for my taste, their compulsory set menus a high price for entry. But others offer some of the most intimate and spellbinding evenings I’ve ever had in Lisbon — tiny A Baiuca, barely the size of a living room, where gutsy amateurs boldly debut; elegant Sala de Fado, newly opened in 2024, attracting legacy fadistas like Célia Leiria; and note-perfect Mesa de Frades, set in an 18th-century chapel adorned with historic azueljo tiles.\n\nAt the latter, I try for a seat late at night, after the last dinner service has been cleared and the audience is thinning out. Behind the tall, gnarled chapel doors, there’s an alchemy after midnight, as scheduled singers — like charismatic Flávia Pereira and velvet-voiced Matilde Sid, both eschewing the traditional black garb — start to share the floor with touring musicians.\n\nFrom the altar mezzanine, the acoustics are breathtaking, and there’s an untrammelled joy and spontaneity to proceedings that I would never have previously associated with the genre. I tap my feet along to upbeat songs — in particular the barnstorming Maria Lisboa, Uma Casa Portuguesa and Canto o Fado — chiming in for the refrains where invited by the performers. At others, like heart-rending Fado Português and Estranha Forma de Vida, I feel a slight prickling in my eyes, despite the language barrier.\n\n“It means a lot to me when I see someone feel the emotion of the song,” Flávia tells me at the end of the night. She’s one of Portugal’s newer artists, subtly adapting this musical genre to her own style. She says her influences are globally selling, modern fadistas such as Mariza, Carminho and Ana Moura — women marching in the footsteps of Amália Rodrigues. “It doesn’t matter where the audience is from,” she concludes. “Fado is in all our souls.”\n\nPublished in the European Cities Collection 2025 byNational Geographic Traveller(UK).To subscribe toNational Geographic Traveller(UK) magazine clickhere.

    "News_title":"Gangs burn down Haiti’s iconic Hotel Oloffson, host to stars and writers",
    "News_text":"Haiti’s storied Hotel Oloffson, a favorite haunt of writers and artists that survived dictatorship, coups and a devastating earthquake and was immortalized in novelist Graham Greene’s “The Comedians,” is no more.\n\nAfter months of resisting gang threats and attacks that forced thousands in its surrounding Carrefour Feuilles neighborhood to abandon their homes and flee, the landmark hotel overlooking Haiti’s capital was “burned to the ground” Saturday evening into Sunday morning. The hotel’s burning was confirmed to the Miami Herald by proprietor Richard A. Morse, who also announced the destruction on X, after drone images began circulating showing its hollowed out structure..\n\nThe culprits: members of the Viv Ansanm gang coalition, who had been using the sprawling hotel as a base for their takeover of Port-au-Prince and have been fighting with Haitian national police officers. Another source who confirmed the hotel’s destruction said it was among several places in the area gangs burned during the confrontation with police, which intensified on Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Losing the Oloffson reflects the incompetence of Haiti’s oligarchs, the Haitian government, the United Nations as well as the French and American governments,” said Morse, an outspoken critic of Haiti’s wave of crises and ongoing political instability.\n\nThe founder of RAM, a Haitian roots band named after him, Morse took over the famed hotel in 1987. At the time it had been closed for a year after having once served as a media hub for visiting press during the years of the Duvalier dictatorship. The musician soon transformed the Oloffson into a gathering place for Haitian culture featuring folk dancers and Vodou rock performances.\n\nHis band’s weekly Thursday performances along the hotel’s creaky, wooden balcony attracted both locals and tourists and became a must attend event as gawking visitors begged to see where Mick Jagger, Jackie Kennedy Onasis and Graham Greene once slept.\n\n“Stepping into this magnificent gingerbread mansion with its cathedral ceilings, you could feel the lingering presence of legends —painters like Hector Hyppolite, Philomé Obin and André Pierre; dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham; former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy; Marlon Brando; and Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton during the filming of “The Comedians;” Charles Addams of The Addams Family; and James Jones, author of From Here to Eternity — to name just a few,” said Port-au-Prince political analyst and former hotel patron Michel Eric Gaillard.\n\n“Sipping a glass of rum at the old Acajou bar, you might have imagined yourself seated beside Rolling Stones icon Mick Jagger, or witnessing Graham Greene in deep conversation with Aubelin Jolicoeur. Brushing your hand against its walls, you did so with reverence—closing your eyes to absorb the vibrations, the echoes, the voices of history,” he added. “The Oloffson withstood the 2010 earthquake, its wooden structure flexing with resilience as it stood tall above Port-au-Prince. But it could not defy manmade disaster. Like an old reel of film, it has faded into oblivion.”\n\nGaelle Delaquis, a promoter of Haitian culture, said the hotel’s destruction represents a great loss.\n\n“I carry so many cherished memories of this cultural landmark,” she said. “It was my Thursday Mass, the birthplace of the original Gede Fest —a true symbol of unity, generational legacy and Haitian excellence.\n\n“They can destroy our city, but not our spirit,” Delaquis added. “Our collective memory is our history.”\n\nGregory Brandt, a fan who also used to support cultural events at the hotel, is mourning the hotel’s destruction while trying to understand the logic.\n\n“I am very sad and don’t understand the use of fire,” Brandt said. “Take the house and move in, but the attraction for destruction and setting fire?”\n\nBuilt in the late 19thcentury, the Oloffson was initially a private home owned by the Sam family, who lived there until President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam in 1915 was lynched by an angry mob in the streets of Port-au-Prince. Sam had only been president for five months at the time of his death, which triggered a U.S. military intervention and a 19-year occupation of Haiti by U.S. marines.\n\nUntil President Jovenel Moïse’s equally brazen slaying four years ago, on July 7, 2021, Sam had been the last Haitian president to be assassinated.\n\nDuring the U.S. occupation, the Oloffson was used by the marines as a hospital, and following the departure of American forces in 1934, it was converted into a hotel in 1935.\n\nIn 1960, Al Seitz, a New Yorker, leased the property and became proprietor of what was then an empty and abandoned structure he later called the Grand Hotel Oloffson. With his wife Suzanne, Seitz later transformed the Gothic-gingerbread hotel into a haven for both local and visiting celebrities whose names graced the hotel’s rooms. In addition to Jagger and Greene, another draw was the Aubelin Jolicoeur room, named after the Haitian gossip columnist on whom Greene based his character Petit Pierre in “The Comedians.”\n\nSeitz was friends with Greene, who visited Haiti for the first time in 1965 and spent months shadowing the hotel manager. It was Seitz who inspired “The Comedians,” said his son Danny, recalling how his father “took Greene everywhere and introduced him to locals and places over several months.”\n\n“Tourism was dead so Greene was his only guest at times. The two started a lifelong friendship, but my father was quite surprised when Greene went back to England and published ‘The Comedians’ in 1966,” Danny Seitz said. “He was, however, honored to have inspired a literary masterpiece that included the same locals and places that he introduced Greene to.”\n\nThe book turned out to be great for business, especially after Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier died in 1971 and Haiti opened its doors.\n\n“That started the golden age of the hotel when celebrities and famous authors like Kurt Vonnegut came,” Danny Seitz said. “My brothers and I are blessed to have grown up there during this period and are so very proud that my parents were the ones that made the hotel world famous and a legendary destination. As a family, we are devastated by this news.”\n\nThe Oloffson itself served as a muse for Greene’s fictional Trianon Hotel in the novel, which tells a tale of treachery and the absurdity of Haiti amid the rule of “Papa Doc” Duvalier. The hotel was also the setting for the 1967 film “The Comedians,” starring Burton and Taylor, in which Burton portrayed the hotel manager, Al Seitz.\n\nSeitz died in 1982 at the age of 64 of cancer, and years later Morse took over.\n\nUnder Morse’s management, the Oloffson braved deepening political instability, dried-up tourism, the 2010 earthquake and worsening gang violence. Still, its low room rates, lunches and rum sours continued to inspire a new generation of writers and foreign correspondents searching for news, as the hotel served as a repository for the latest political gossip and intrigue.\n\nDespite curfews, it still attracted Haiti’s intellectuals, artists and foreign diplomats on its porch until the gang violence in Carrefour Feuilles and downtown Port-au-Prince completely made it off limits.\n\n“The Oloffson has literally attracted everyone,” Morse said, noting that the late Anthony Bourdain, the celebrated chef and author, once listed it as among his five favorite spots after visiting the country in 2011 to film season 7 of his show “No Reservations.”\n\nThe demise of the Oloffson follows a similar attack on The Lodge, a popular hotel in the hills above Port-au-Prince. The destruction is part of an alarming rise of violence against private homes and businesses by armed gangs that began ramping up their attacks at the beginning of the year. The violence is paralyzing Port-au-Prince, now up to 90% under gang control, and is quickly spreading to other regions of Haiti.\n\nLate last week, at least eight people were reported killed in gang attacks in the Lascahobas area in the Central Plateau. The United Nations issued an alert for the region after armed gangs orchestrated an attack, intensifying the already precarious humanitarian crisis in the rural area.\n\nLascahobas was already hosting 7,455 internally displaced persons following gang attacks in April, the U.N. said. Now with the recent attacks, more Haitians have been forced to flee their homes.\n\nIn Port-au-Prince, gangs have continued to torch century-old homes in historic neighborhoods like Pacot, not far from the Oloffson hotel, and in the hills above the capital of Kenscoff.\n\nMorse, who said he never understood why the hotel was listed as being in an off limits “red zone” back in the 2000s when the gang problem wasn’t what it is today, is vowing to rebuild.\n\n“I’ll do everything I can to get it back on its feet in spite of the powers that be,” he said. “I feel free to finally speak out again. They can only burn it once.”",

    "News_title":"Scientific First: 'Slow-Motion' Earthquakes Captured in Real Time",
    "News_text":"Slow-motion earthquakes, as you might guess from the name, involve the release of pent-up geological energy over the course of days or weeks rather than minutes – and scientists have now recorded some as they were happening.\n\nThese quakes, also known as slow slip earthquakes or just slow earthquakes, are typically too gentle to cause immediate danger. However, they can help scientists predict full-speed earthquakes or tsunamis, which can of course befar more dangerous.\n\nA team led by researchers from the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) tracked two separate slow slip events (SSEs) in real time – one in 2015 and another in 2020.\n\nSpecial borehole sensors were positioned deep underwater, close to theNankai Troughsubduction zone off the coast of Japan. There, the Philippine Sea plate is pushing under the Eurasian plate. The researchers describe the activity of the slow quakes as being like a tectonic shock absorber.\n\n\"It's like a ripple moving across the plate interface,\"sayshydrogeophysicist Josh Edgington, from UTIG.\n\nRelated:Earthquakes Today Could Be Echoes of Powerful Quakes Centuries Ago\n\nThe measurements confirm what scientists had previously thought about these slow-motion earthquakes, which were only recently discovered: that they can be significant in releasing (or building)stress around a fault line.\n\nThis subduction zone is part of thePacific Ring of Fire, an extensive collection of volcanoes andfaultssurrounding the Pacific Ocean. It's responsible for many of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis on record.\n\nAnd the findings here, about the shock absorber effect, will be crucial in understanding when and where future earthquakes could hit. Other faults lack this kind of tectonic protection,including Cascadiaoff the western coast of North America.\n\n\"This is a place that we know has hosted magnitude 9 earthquakes and can spawn deadly tsunamis,\"saysgeophysicist Demian Saffer, from UTIG. \"Are there creaks and groans that indicate the release of accumulated strain, or is the fault near the trench deadly silent?\"\n\n\"Cascadia is a clear top-priority area for the kind of high-precision monitoring approach that we've demonstrated is so valuable at Nankai.\"\n\nIt's only possible to measure these SSEs because of advances in sensor technology, meaning shakes of much lower strength – sometimes only shifting the ground a few millimeters at a time – can be detected.\n\nThrough their analysis, the researchers were able to determine that slow earthquakes may be related to high geologic fluid pressures, and that the upper part of the fault can release pressure independently of the rest of it.\n\nAll of this helps to inform modelspredicting earthquakesand tsunamis – with the potential to save thousands of lives. The last major Nankai Trough quakehappened in 1946, with the loss of tens of thousands of properties and causing more than 1,300 deaths.\n\nPredicting earthquakes isn't an exact science, with a host of variables involved, but it's something we're getting better at. Witheach studyand technological upgrade, seismologists are improving their models, and adding in data from slow earthquake activity could help greatly.\n\n\"The patterns of strain accumulation and release along the offshore reaches of subduction megathrusts are particularly important toward understanding hazards associated with shallow coseismic slip and tsunamigenesis,\"writethe researchers in their published paper.\n\nThe research has been published inScience.\n\nAlpha Male Primates a Myth, Researchers Find in New Study\n\nTomatoes in The Galapagos Islands Appear to Be Evolving in Reverse\n\nEarth Became a Hothouse 250 Million Years Ago, And We Finally Know Why",

    "News_title":"Earthquake swarms are fueling fear of the 'big one' in Japan",
    "News_text":"More than 1,300 earthquakes have hit Japan’s Tokara Islands in two weeks, prompting evacuations of dozens of residents from the remote archipelago on the country’s southern tip.\n\nAlthough no major damage has been reported and no tsunami warnings have been issued, the Japan Meteorological Agency has cautioned that tremors as strong as a “lower 6” on Japan’s seven-stage seismic intensity scale — such as one that occurred Thursday — may continue.\n\nLower 6 indicates an intensity that may make it difficult for people to stand without holding on to stable support.\n\n\"The seismic activity remains dynamic,\" JMA official Ayataka Ebita said at a news conference Sunday — and that has fueled fears of a megaquake.\n\nThe temblors have coincided with viral panic stemming from the 2021 reprint of a comic book that many are now interpreting as a clairvoyant prediction of a major earthquake. “The real disaster will come in July 2025,” read the cover of manga artist Ryo Tatsuki’s “The Future that I Saw.” The graphic novel, which explores Tatsuki’s dreams, also features a panel that says “the ocean floor between Japan and the Philippines will crack.”\n\nIn recent months, that prediction has become the subject of intense online speculation. It has even spread to nearby countries like Hong Kong, where it has been blamed for a recent dip in tourism to Japan.\n\nLast month, Hong Kong Airlines suspended all flights to the southern Japanese prefectures of Kagoshima and Kumamoto, citing low demand.\n\nRead more:First came the heat. Then the lovebugs invaded\n\nIn South Korea, earthquake panic has been cited as a reason for the cheapness of flights to Japan compared with last year, although industry experts have said that there are other factors at play: increased competition between airlines and a stronger yen that reduces the buying power of South Korean tourists.\n\nOn Saturday, South Korean singer Taemin of the band SHINee, who was in Japan for a concert, referenced Tatsuki’s prediction in a livestream, assuring fans he was safe and jokingly saying an earthquake might make his performance “look cool.”\n\nBut faced with backlash for making light of a natural disaster, he later issued an apology in Japanese and Korean.\n\nThere is a reason why a comic book’s scientifically baseless prediction is currently gaining so much traction: Tatsuki was (sort of) right before. The first edition of the graphic novel, published in 1999, referenced a “massive disaster” in March 2011 and contained lines like: \"I dreamed of a great disaster. The waters of the Pacific Ocean south of the Japanese archipelago will rise.\"\n\nThat prediction seemed to come true with the massive2011 Tohoku earthquake, which killed over 19,000 people and triggered the tsunami that led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. At an estimated $360 billion incurred in economic damages, the earthquake remains one of the costliest natural disasters in history. It registered 9.0 on the Richter scale, which measures the magnitude of the earthquake. Shindo, Japan’s seismic intensity scale, measures intensity at a specific location.\n\nThe coincidence catapulted Tatsuki to fame and made her manga a bestseller.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Tatsuki has tried to quell the panic over her latest prediction, saying in a statement issued through her publisher that she was “not a prophet.”\n\n\"I believe that everyone should be free to make their own interpretation,” she told Japan’s Mainichi newspaper in May. “However, I think it is important to not get overly swept up in the process and to act appropriately in consideration of expert opinion.\"\n\nRead more:7 California faults that could produce among the most devastating earthquakes\n\nJapanese government officials and scientists have taken pains to debunk the theories, stressing that it is scientifically impossible to predict earthquakes with such accuracy.\n\n\"It is absolutely a coincidence. There is no causal connection,\" said Ebita of the JMA on Saturday. \"In Japan, earthquakes can happen at any time. Please be prepared, always.”\n\n:::\n\nJapan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, given its location within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a 25,000-mile-long belt of seismic and volcanic hot spots that loops around the perimeter of the Pacific Ocean, including the U.S. West Coast.\n\nThe country experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year, or nearly a fifth of the world’s total, and earthquake evacuation drills are regularly practiced by government agencies and public schools.\n\nOn New Year’s Day last year, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake in Noto Peninsula in central Japan led to over 500 deaths and destroyed or damaged at least 37,000 homes.\n\nBecause they sit astride two overlapping tectonic plates, the Tokara Islands have long been prone to seismic activity such as “earthquake swarms,” a burst of relatively minor earthquakes occurring in quick succession that can last up to several months. (Southern California is another common site of earthquake swarms, though many areso minor they are barely perceived.)\n\nThe archipelago spans 12 individual islands — just seven of which are inhabited by a combined 660 or so residents — and the current swarm of quakes there is the most substantial since 1995. Two recent swarms that occurred in 2021 and 2023 exceeded just over 300 quakes each.\n\nAlthough it’s unclear why the current swarm is so much greater than those instances, Takuya Nishimura, an earthquake expert at Kyoto University’s Disaster Prevention Research Institute, says it may be a result of volcanic activity.\n\n“I suspect the subsurface movement of magma caused severe earthquake activity,” he said. “Several past studies show submarine volcanoes around the swarm region, which suggests the existence of magma under the ground.”\n\nDespite the current viral attention around the Tokara swarm, experts like Nishimura are more concerned with another, far more credible earthquake forecast that has loomed over the country for years.\n\nEarlier this year, a government panel estimated that there is an 80% chance of a magnitude 8 to 9 megaquake on the Richter scale occurring along Japan’s Nankai Trough in the next 30 years.\n\nA 559-mile long fault line located off Japan’s Pacific coast characterized by its subduction, in which one tectonic plate is forced under another, the Nankai Trough has produced devastating earthquakes every 90 to 200 years. The last one occurred in 1946.\n\nUnder the government’s worst-case scenario, the next Nankai megathrust earthquake is projected to kill about 300,000 people — most of them likely to perish in the tsunamis reaching as high as 100 feet — and cause up to $1.8 trillion in damage.\n\nBy comparison, the death toll for the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake — the two biggest seismic events in recent California history — was 63 and 57. In the meantime, experts are studying the southernmost tip of the San Andreas fault, which hasn’t had an earthquake of7 or largersince sometime between 1721 and 1731.\n\n“A future great Nankai earthquake is surely the most long-anticipated earthquake in history — it is the original definition of the ‘Big One’,”wrotegeologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A. Hubbard in 2024.\n\nEarlier this month, the Japanese government announced a series of countermeasures aimed at reducing the number of deaths by up to 80% and structural damage by 50%, including making buildings more earthquake-resistant and improving evacuation protocols.\n\n“It is necessary for the nation, municipalities, companies and nonprofits to come together and take measures in order to save as many lives as possible,” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said.\n\nBut Nishimura, the earthquake expert, says that more needs to be done to meet these ambitious targets.\n\n“Although realizing the decrease in structural damage may be challenging due to a limited budget, reducing fatalities can be achieved through more soft-type countermeasures, such as training and evacuation drills,” he said.\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

    "News_title":"Natural disasters can be hardest on older rural Americans",
    "News_text":"Hurricanes, tornadoes and other extreme weather do not distinguish between urban and rural boundaries. But when a disaster strikes, there are big differences in how well people are able to respond and recover -- and older adults in rural areas are especially vulnerable.\n\nIf a disaster causes injuries, getting health care can take longer in rural areas. Manyrural hospitals have closed, leaving patients traveling longer distances for care.\n\nAt the same time, rural areas havehigher percentages of older adults, a group that is more likely to have chronic health problems that make experiencing natural disasters especially dangerous.\n\nMedical treatments, such as dialysis, can be disrupted when power goes out or clinics are damaged, and injuries are more likely around property damaged by flooding or powerful winds.\n\nAsa sociologistwho studies rural issues and directs theInstitute of Behavioral Scienceat the University of Colorado Boulder, I believe that understanding the risks is essential for ensuring healthier lives for older adults. I see many different ways rural communities are helping reduce their vulnerability in disasters.\n\nDisasters disrupt health care, especially in isolated rural regions\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 20% of the country's rural population is age 65 and over, compared with only 16% of urban residents. That's about10 million older adultsliving in rural areas.\n\nThere are three primary reasons rural America has been aging faster than the rest of the country: Young people have beenleaving for college and job opportunities, meaning fewer residents are starting new families. Many older rural residents are choosing to \"age in place\" where they have strong social ties. And some rural areas are gaining older adultswho choose to retire there.\n\nAn aging population means rural areas tend to have a larger percentage of residents with chronic disease, such as dementia, heart disease, respiratory illness and diabetes.\n\nAccording to research from the National Council on Aging, nearly95% of adults age 60and older have at least one chronic condition, while more than 78% have two or more. Rural areas also havehigher rates of death from chronic diseases, particularly heart disease.\n\nAt the same time, health care access in rural areas is rapidly declining.\n\nNearly 200rural hospitals have closedor stopped providing in-patient care since 2005. Over 700 more -- one-third of the nation's remaining rural hospitals -- were considered to beat risk of closingeven before thecuts to Medicaid that the president signed in July 2025.\n\nHospital closures have left rural residents travelingabout 20 miles fartherfor common in-patient health care services than they did two decades ago, and even farther for specialist care.\n\nThose miles might seem trivial, but in emergencies when roads are damaged or flooded, they can mean losing access to care and treatment.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005, 44% of patients on dialysismissed at least one treatment session, and almost 17% missed three or more.\n\nWhen Hurricanes Matthew and Florence hit rural Robeson County, North Carolina, in 2016 and 2018, some patients who relied on insulin to manage their blood sugar levelswent without insulin for weeks. The county had high rates of poverty and poor health already, and the healthy foods people needed to manage the disease were also hard to find after the storm.\n\nInsulin is important for treating diabetes -- a chronic disease estimated to affectnearly one-third of adults age 65 and older. But a sufficient supply can beharder to maintainwhen a disaster knocks out power, because insulin should be kept cool, and medical facilities and drugstores may be harder for patients to reach.\n\nRural residents also often live farther from community centers, schools or other facilities that can serve as cooling centers during heat waves or evacuation centers in times of crisis.\n\nAlzheimer's disease can make evacuation difficult\n\nCognitive decline also affects older adults' ability to manage disasters.\n\nOver 11% of Americans age 65 and older -- more than 7 million people --have Alzheimer's disease or related dementia, and the prevalence is higher in rural areas' older populationscompared with urban areas.\n\nCaregivers for family members living with dementia maystruggle to find timeto prepare for disasters. And when disaster strikes, they face unique challenges. Disasters disrupt routines, which can cause agitation for people with Alzheimer's, and patients may resist evacuation.\n\nLiving through a disaster can also worsen brain health over the long run. Older adults who lived through the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami were found to havegreater cognitive declineover the following decade, especially those who lost their homes or jobs, or whose health care routines were disrupted.\n\nSocial safety nets are essential\n\nOne thing that many rural communities have that helps is a strong social fabric. Those social connections can helpreduce older adults' vulnerabilitywhen disasters strike.\n\nFollowing severe flooding in Colorado in 2013, social connections helped older adultsnavigate the maze of paperworkrequired for disaster aid, and some even provided personal loans.\n\nFriends, family and neighbors in rural areas often check in on seniors, particularly those living alone. They can help themdevelop disaster response plansto ensure older residents have access to medications and medical treatment, and that they havean evacuation plan.\n\nRural communities and local groups can also help build up older adults' mental and physical health before and after storms bydeveloping educational, social and exercise programs. Better health and social connections canimprove resilience, including older adults' ability to respond to alerts and recover after disasters.\n\nEnsuring that everyone in the community has that kind of support is important in rural areas and cities alike asstorm and flood risks worsen, particularly for older adults.\n\nLori Hunteris a professor of Sociology and director of the Institute of Behavioral Science at theUniversity of Colorado-Boulder.

    "News_title":"The Problem With ‘Move to Higher Ground’",
    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nBefore the waters of Texas’s Guadalupe Riverrosemore than 33 feet over the course of five hours, the National Weather Service sent out a series of alerts. The first one that included Kerr County, where most of the fatalities would ultimately take place, warned of “considerable” flood threat and went out just after 1 a.m. on July 4. It triggered push alerts on people’s phones. It set off alarms on any weather radio tuned to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s frequency. More alerts from the weather agency would follow.\n\nBut in a situation like this, weather alerts are not enough: Evacuation orders and other instructions mostly come from local governments. But the Kerrville Police Department posted its first evacuation order to social media just after 5 a.m., hours after the warnings from NWS began, and Kerr County and Kerrville posted theirs even later, according to aKXAN investigation.\n\n“Move to higher ground now,” the police department said. “Be safe and move to higher ground,” said the county. The water had risen catastrophically by then.\n\nThe swiftness of the oncoming danger meant that even the fastest municipal response would have met major challenges. But what’s clear is that the alerting system failed many people—whether because they had spotty service, weren’t checking social media, had“alert fatigue”in an area where flash-flood alerts are common, or were vacationers unsure of where higher ground might be. Kerr County hadconsideredinstalling a system of sirens along the river years earlier, but the project had been passed over because of cost. In the end, very little in the way of a meaningful warning system was in place for the area, and many who needed to evacuate didn’t. The death toll from the flooding now exceeds 100. (Kerr County and Kerrville officials did not return a request for comment at the time of publication.)\n\nThis Texas tragedy is unique in its details and devastation. But cellphone alerts and emergency warnings more broadly keep failing people in high-profile ways: During the Los Angeles fires earlier this year, asoftware issueresulted in evacuation orders being sent to millions of people who didn’t need to evacuate. (My colleague in Los Angeles County received 11 evacuation push alerts to her phone, likelyall of them sent in error.) In Maui, during the catastrophic Lahaina fires, the authorities sent out evacuation orders over the wireless emergency-alert network, which is meant to reach everyone’s cellphones—but some residents said they’d never received the orders, delaying their evacuation until the last minute or leaving them in harm’s way.\n\nThese are failures of technology—messages sent but not received, or messages received by the wrong people. But they are also errors in human judgment, reflecting gaps in training. Before any alert goes out, someone has to write one, then decide how and when to send it. A lot can go wrong there, and often does.\n\nIn Texas, the National Weather Service hasdefendedits forecasts, and meteorologistsagreethat itaccurately predicted the risks. Staffing didn’t appear to be an issue, despite the cuts, buyouts, and early retirements that the Trump administration has pushed at the agency; its Austin\/San Antonio forecast office hadstaffed upin anticipation of a potential storm. But the position of warning-coordination meteorologist there wasvacant, along with a science-and-operations-officer post. Both positions are responsible for liaising with local authorities. The warning-coordination meteorologist in particular helps local agencies understand what forecasts mean and when to make evacuation calls. “They’re the connectors,” Jeannette Sutton, a social scientist at the University at Albany’s College of Emergency Preparedness, told me. “Without them, there’s a gap.”\n\nKerr County appears not to have used its access to the federally administered Wireless Emergency Alerts system—which can send out messages to cellphones—until the afternoon of July 6, when flood risk on the Guadalupe was still present but past its peak. Even then, the message was scant on details. It read: “High confidence of river flooding at North Fork of river. Move to higher ground.”\n\nWriting a good alert message is harder than it might seem, Sutton told me, and many local officials across the country don’t know how. An alert message should include at least three basic elements—the affected location, plain-language instructions on actions to take, and the time by which people should act—yet many lack one or more. Authorities who use the Wireless Emergency Alerts system aren’t required to be credentialed or trained; too often, Sutton said, in the moment of a dire event, facing a blank screen, people in charge of writing the alerts can freeze.\n\nShe has trained some 500 local officials on best practices for alerts, but the program’s funding, from FEMA, lapsed in May. She and her colleagues have also developed a“warning lexicon”that governments can use to write clear and actionable warning-message templates in language regular humans can understand. San Mateo County, in the San Francisco Bay Area, is one of the few governments to have officially adopted that system.\n\nShruti Dhapodkar, the director of emergency management for San Mateo County, told me that December 5, 2024, was a wake-up call. Her county was suddenly under an active tsunami warning. A major earthquake had struck off the California coast, and across the area, a message from the National Tsunami Warning Center popped up on people’s phones. Then things started to devolve: About 30 minutes later, San Mateo County mistakenly sent out a message on social media that said the warning had been canceled. But it hadn’t; the cancellation applied only to Hawaii. Officials issued a corrective, sowing confusion. Even the correct message was difficult to understand: Its directive to “move to high ground” was functionally meaningless to people who didn’t know how high their property was or where higher ground would be. Some local governments, including San Mateo County, decided not to sound their tsunami sirens. Some, like Berkeley, issued mandatory evacuation orders; others didn’t.\n\nWithin about an hour, the National Weather Service determined that the danger had passed. But if this had been a dress rehearsal for the Big One, the Bay Area’s crisis plans had flopped.\n\nSince then, San Mateo’s emergency-management department has worked to coordinate across the 32 local agencies that have power to send emergency alerts; the next time a potential disaster strikes, they will all have a unified voice, Dhapodkar said, to cut down on conflicting information and the resulting erosion of trust. When residents look to a second or third agency for confirmation of any instructions they received, they’ll get it immediately. Alert templates are now pre-written for several scenarios, in clear, jargon-free language. And the county has built a website to show if an address counts as “high ground,” and is teaching residents to use it.\n\nIn a disaster, people need to hear in multiple ways that they’re in real danger, and that requires thinking beyond cellphone alerts and social media. “The more opportunities you have to receive a message, the more likely you are to receive it and act on it,” Mary Jo Flynn-Nevins, the chief of emergency services for Sacramento County, told me—so putting a community’s entire messaging effort into a single technology is “just increasing the odds of failure.” In rural parts of Sacramento County, her department has implemented a landline-alerting system too, and people from the sheriff’s department can drive around announcing emergency messages through loudspeakers. Drones with speakers can alert people from the air.\n\nBut none of this guarantees that the county will reach every last person. Emergency management “really requires people to understand their basic risks and believe that they’re at risk,” Flynn-Nevins said. She thinks everyone should have a weather radio, the kind enabled to receive NOAA weather alerts. They don’t rely on the power grid, and if the National Weather Service issues a warning in the middle of the night, it will wake you up with a loud tone. People are naturally complacent in assuming that important information will come to them, Dhapodkar said, but simply paying attention to the weather forecast and considering how you’d deal with an impending risk goes a long way toward keeping out of danger. As the planet warms and the frequency and intensity of several kinds of weather disasters in the United States climb up, and as the Trump administration indicates that it willpull more resourcesfrom the federal safety apparatus, the onus of emergency preparedness will grow only more local, down to each of us.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

    "News_title":"Graham Greene gingerbread hotel destroyed by Haiti’s descent into chaos",
    "News_text":"Haiti’s famed gingerbread hotel that inspired the novelist Graham Greene was burned down by gangs as the countryplunged further into crisis.\n\nOnce a presidential palace, the storied Hotel Oloffson was built at the end of the 19th century and had survived coups, dictatorships and the 2010 earthquake.\n\nBut the hotel manager Richard Morse has confirmed the Port-au-Prince landmark visited by stars including Mick Jagger and Elizabeth Taylor had become the latest target ofgang violence gripping the Caribbean country.\n\nPictures of the devastation showed the once grand white mansion, which boasted turrets, spires and wooden lattice work had been reduced to piles of ash, with just the singed bones of the building left behind.\n\nHaitians mourned the loss of the iconic building which drew intellectuals, creatives and politicians from around the world, including Jackie Kennedy and Tennessee Williams.\n\nIt also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene’s 1966 novel The Comedians, set in Haiti under the dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc.\n\n“From the beginning it was a place where Haitian elites would gather, and then international elites, filmmakers, dancers and writers would come and use the Oloffson to describe the history of Haiti, as Graham Greene did,” said Olsen Jean Julien, Haiti’s former culture minister.\n\n“It’s a place where regular people would meet with elites, would meet with artists, would meet with everybody,” Mr Julien told The Telegraph.\n\n“When gangs burn down a symbol of social inclusion and cohesion... It tells us that society is very sick,” he said.\n\nHaiti has beenterrorised by a coalition of gangsled by warlord Jimmy “Barbecue” Chérizier for more than a year, with criminal groups murdering and raping thousands of citizens.\n\nGangs now have “near-total control” of the capital, according to the UN, with criminal organisations now expanding to attack previously peaceful areas.\n\nMore than 5,500 were killed in gang-related violence in Haiti in 2024 and more than a million people have fled their homes.\n\nCredit: Social Media\n\nUntil last week the Oloffson had survived the unrest.\n\nMr Morse, who had been overseeing the property remotely from the US since the hotel’s closure in 2022, said that for months, there were persistent rumours that the hotel had burned down.\n\n“So when I heard Sunday morning that it burned, I did what I usually do, which is call someone who has drones and have them go take a look,” he said. “This time, when they called back, they said something like, ‘take a seat.’ I knew then that this wasn’t like the other times.”\n\nMr Morse said he was reluctant to talk about what happened to the hotel given that in Haiti “so many people are dying and being raped and losing everything that I don’t want the focus to be on the hotel”.\n\nJames Jean-Louis, who lives in the hills above the Oloffson said the attack began on Saturday. He saw flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.\n\nNestled in the upscale community of Pacot in the southeast corner of the country’s capital, the Oloffson was surrounded by lush gardens and often described as a mythical place known for its creaking parquet floors that characterise Haiti’s endangered gingerbread homes.\n\nBuilt as a presidential palace at the turn of the 18th century, the Oloffson was one of the most famous examples of gingerbread architecture, a unique, ornate style that flourished in Haiti at the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe building became a Marine Corps Hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.\n\nA 1940s advertisement by Haiti’s tourism department said that the hotel was situated “in the coolest section of the town” and noted that English, French, German and Spanish were spoken there.\n\nCredit: Instagram\/jeanoscar.a\n\nIn the late 1980s, Mr Morse became the hotel’s manager. His band, RAM, played Haitian roots music on Thursday nights that became legendary, as were the Day of the Dead celebrations known as Fèt Gede that drew in Vodou practitioners.\n\nThe hotel closed in recent years as gangs began raiding and seizing control of once peaceful communities.\n\n“During the earthquake, during the political unrest in Haiti it was a place of reference, where people would go and talk to friends and eat and to have discussions,” Mr Julien said.\n\n“I’ve been to that place, I don’t know, I can’t count how many times... It’s very rare a building has that kind of sentiment and historical value in Port-au-Prince, that’s what we’ve lost, so it’s very painful.”\n\nHe added: “The destruction… It breaks my heart because this is something that Haiti should take care of, not destroy.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Opening night atNBA Summer Leaguein Las Vegas has turned into an annual spectacle, and this year will be no different.\n\nCooperFlagg's debutis coming — against Bronny James, no less.\n\nFlagg, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, and the Dallas Mavericks will open summer play Thursday against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers, always a huge draw in Las Vegas, have 2024 second-round pick Bronny James — the son of NBA scoring king LeBron James — on their summer roster.\n\nThe game at UNLV's Thomas and Mack Center will be packed. Plenty of NBA players and personnel will be there. Some courtside tickets are being listed on the secondary resale market at more than $3,000 a pop. All this, mind you, for an exhibition game where the outcome is almost certain to be forgotten within a few days.\n\n“I’m excited,” Flagg said. “I’ve been in the gym with the guys, and I’m excited to just get out there, get back on the court, play some 5-on-5.”\n\nIt will be a circus atmosphere for Mavericks-Lakers and Day 1 of the full-fledged, 30-team Summer League — other smaller summer leagues in Utah and California wrapped up earlier this week — is certain to be announced as a sellout.\n\nThe scene will likely resemble what awaited Victor Wembanyama for his San Antonio debut in 2023 (hundreds of people gathered around the tunnel with their phones out to grab a photo or video of him simply coming out for warmups that night) or Zion Williamson's debut in 2019 with New Orleans — when an earthquake centered in California shook Las Vegas enough for play to be stopped early for the night.\n\n“I just want to go out, show I've improved, show I've gotten better,\" Flagg said.\n\nSome of what to know about Summer League:\n\nThe schedule and format\n\nIt starts Thursday and runs through a championship game on July 20. All teams will play a four-game regular season, and then the top four teams will head to the playoffs for a semifinal game on July 19 and the title game one day later.\n\nThe 26 teams that don't make the playoffs will be matched up for one last game, a consolation bracket of sorts.\n\nAll teams will play at least five games in Las Vegas; the championship-game qualifiers will play six.\n\nQuarters are 10 minutes long, instead of the usual 12 for NBA games. Nobody fouls out until they commit their 10th foul, instead of the usual six-and-you're-out rule. Overtimes are two minutes, not the usual five.\n\nThe ‘heave’ rule\n\nIn place for NBA Summer League: a rule that says players who take those end-of-quarter shots from really, really deep won't count against their individual shooting percentage.\n\nThe so-called “heave rule” says any shot taken within the final three seconds of the first three quarters and is launched from at least 36 feet away on any play that starts in the backcourt will count as a team shot attempt — but not an individual one.\n\nMany players have avoided taking the miracle 50-footer or deeper shot at the end of quarters to protect their personal shooting percentages. The “heave rule” fixes that.\n\nAs with many rule changes, it's getting tried out in summer leagues before likely being implemented as an NBA rule. It was used for the games earlier this month at the summer leagues in Utah and California.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nIf form from past years hold, don't expect the high draft picks — like Flagg, No. 2 pick Dylan Harper of San Antonio, No. 3 pick VJ Edgecombe of Philadelphia and No. 4 pick Kon Kneuppel of Charlotte — to log big minutes for their teams in Las Vegas.\n\nHarper (groin) and Edgecombe (thumb sprain) have already been ruled out for the San Antonio-Philadelphia game on Thursday night, one that will immediately follow the Mavs-Lakers game as part of an ESPN doubleheader from Day 1.\n\nIt's not uncommon for top picks to be shut down after playing a game or two. Edgecombe missed the final two games of Philadelphia's three-game run in Utah, and Harper missed all three of San Antonio's games at the California Classic.\n\nWhat else is happening\n\nThink of Summer League in Las Vegas as the NBA's annual convention: A slew of players, coaches, agents and executives are there for at least some of the event. It has grown steadily over the last 20 years, with no end in sight.\n\nThere's also a Board of Governors meeting in Las Vegas early next week, and it seems likely that Commissioner Adam Silver will announce plans for the league to formally begin looking at expansion — though there is no guarantee that the NBA will ultimately decide to add teams.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA:https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/nba",

    "News_title":"‘It’s just unfair’: What end of TPS means for Nicaraguans and Hondurans in the U.S.",
    "News_text":"Virginia Guevara came to the United States from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in the 1990s, before the country was granted Temporary Protected Status following the devastating destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.\n\nGuevara, 48 at the time, found a new and better life in the U.S. by working as a kitchen helper. Now, at 78, she faces possible deportation back to Honduras, a country she hasn’t been to in decades, after the Trump administration ended deportation protections for over 51,000 Hondurans on Monday.\n\nHer family is now concerned about what will happen in September when TPS for Honduras officially expires. Her grandson, Isaac Dubon, is worried about what would happen to her if she’s detained in anImmigration and Customs Enforcement facility, after news reports ofmultiple deaths, including five alone in Florida.\n\n“She is an elderly woman with high blood pressure and diabetes,” Dubon said of his grandmother, who lives in Oakland Park in Broward County.\n\nMaria Elena Hernandez, a 67-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant, has been living and working in the U.S. for nearly 30 years with TPS. She worked as a cleaner at a university for 18 years, and two years ago, she began receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nOn Monday, Hernandez, who lives in Broward, became part of a group of 2,900 Nicaraguans who learned that the Trump administration is ending their TPS, the measure that grants deportation protection and work permits to immigrants in the U.S. from countries in turmoil. In September, she could face deportation to a country she has not been to in decades, unable to manage her two chronic diseases and separated from her family, who are U.S. citizens.\n\nThe terminations of TPS for Honduras and Nicaragua announced on Monday are set to take effect on Sept. 8.\n\nTPS for Honduras and Nicaragua was first granted in January 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. In the years since, multiple U.S. attorneys general and Homeland Security secretaries have extended those protections due to ongoing recovery challenges, subsequent natural disasters, and worsening economic and political crises.\n\nHernandez is among a dozen Honduran, Nicaraguan and Nepali TPS holders who filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Monday regarding its decision to end the protections for their nationalities. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco, argues that the administration is determined to dismantle TPS entirely regardless of current real-life conditions in those countries or any legal considerations.\n\nThe nation of Nepal, also named in the lawsuit, was first designated for TPS in June 2015 following a catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of severe aftershocks that killed nearly 9,000 people and displaced millions. In June, the Trump administration announced the termination of Nepal’s TPS designation, with protections set to end on Aug. 5. Altogether, the TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal will strip legal status and protections from approximately 61,000 people—51,000 from Honduras, 7,200 from Nepal, and 2,900 from Nicaragua.\n\n“The termination of TPS is very terrifying for me. It has affected me emotionally and financially, as we would lose our jobs and our health insurance,” Hernandez said. She said that since receiving TPS, she has paid taxes and contributed both economically and culturally to the United States.\n\n“I have lived here for over 25 years,” she added. “Now they want me to return to Nicaragua, where there are so many problems, to the point that this government recommended its citizens not to visit it.”\n\nFlorida is home to more than 40% of Nicaraguans living in the United States, including many like Hernandez, though not all are TPS holders. Many reside in the Miami area, particularly in the city of Sweetwater, often referred to as “Little Managua” for itshigh number of Nicaraguan residents.\n\nThis is the second time Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders experience uncertainty a about their fate as the Trump administration takes steps to end their protections for a second time. A similar attempt was made in 2017 during Trump’s first term, targeting those countries as well as Sudan, Haiti and El Salvador. That effort was successfully challenged in federal court. Now, eight years later, these communities are being forced to fight the same battle all over again. El Salvador’s TPS is the only deportation protection the Trump administration has not terminated, allowing the extension granted under the Biden administration to stand. A close ally in Trump-era immigration crackdowns—including the controversial deportation of Venezuelans to its mega-prison, CECOT—El Salvador remains an exception, as TPS for Venezuela, Haiti, Cameroon and Afghanistan has been ended.\n\nHarold Rocha, president of the Nicaraguan American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said his group had anticipated the decision by the Trump administration. The organization had been part of a coalition advocating for the Biden administration to grant a new TPS designation for Nicaraguans who had recently arrived as well as those in the U.S. since 1999.\n\n“We actively tried to get the previous administration to grant the new designation because we feared what we are seeing now was going to pass,” he said.\n\nRocha said the group had been close to achieving a new TPS designation, but the Biden administration instead began a new humanitarian parole program to help reduce the number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. At the time, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told his group the new designation was being put on hold so the administration could determine if the new program was being effective.\n\nThe humanitarian parole program, known as CHNV for the Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who benefited from it, allowed more than 500,000 peoplelegally came to the United States. But it was abruptly terminated mid-stream by the Trump administration.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Leave Immediately’: Trump administration orders self-deportation for Biden-era parolees\n\nRocha said his organization is pivoting to educate and provide information on what to do now for Nicaraguans who may now face deportation after decades of living in the United States.\n\n“Many of them have been active members of the communities where they lived and work. They are full members of those communities. Many of them are spouses or parents to US citizens. How do they leave that behind?” Rocha said.\n\nThe Trump administration, in its decisions to terminate TPS for multiple countries, has consistently labeled those nations as sufficiently safe for their nationals living in the U.S. to return to.\n\nBut that has contradicted the administration’s own advisories regarding U.S. citizens visiting those countries. Nicaragua and Honduras are both listed by the State Department at Travel Advisory Level 3 — “Reconsider Travel” — citing high crime rates, risks of wrongful detention and lack of fair trials. U.S. citizens face a blanket prohibition from traveling to one department in Honduras, Gracias a Dios, because of high levels of criminal activity from drug trafficking, according to the State Department advisory.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in San Francisco by the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law, the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance highlights what the groups say is a pattern repeated from the previous round of TPS terminations.\n\nThe suit says DHS Secretary Kristi Noem cited certain positive developments—such as increased tourism and real estate investment—as reasons for ending protections, while ignoring key country conditions that had previously justified TPS, including “political violence” and “staggering levels of crime.”\n\nThe 60-day timeline provided for the termination of TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans is unlawful, the lawsuit argues, because it leaves long-time TPS holders—many of whom have lived and worked legally in the United States for decades—with virtually no time to prepare for losing their legal status and employment authorization.\n\n“The decisions to strip legal status from people who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years, and in most cases at least 25, and followed all the rules, are not just callous. It’s also illegal,” said Jessica Bansal, attorney at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. “The administration cannot manufacture a predetermined outcome without regard for its statutory obligations.”\n\nAccording to the attorneys, no TPS termination in the past 20 years, including those under the first Trump administration, has provided such limited notice to individuals with long-standing protections.\n\nMaureen Porras, the vice mayor of Doral who immigrated to the United States from Nicaragua in 1996, said she found the Trump administration decision “disheartening.” She cited the 2018 protests against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega’s government that led to widespread crackdowns on citizens as signs of concern for people returning to the country.\n\n“I don’t think the socio-economic and socio-political conditions are favorable for or safe enough for these folks to return,” she said.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Miami said in a posting Monday on X that he is“profoundly concerned for those who cannot safely return to Nicaraguadue to the dangers they are likely to face.” He called on the Trump administration to reconsider its TPS decision the Central American nation.\n\n“For years, the Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo regime has deprived the Nicaraguan people of their fundamental freedoms, forcing thousands into exile in numerous countries, including the United States,” his comment on X said.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said on X on Monday that the decision to end TPS for both countries is“a heartbreaking setback”for hundreds of thousands of immigrants across the country, including many in Miami-Dade.\n\n“For decades, TPS holders from Honduras and Nicaragua have lived and worked here under lawful protection, helping to strengthen our economy and enrich our society,” she said. “Forcing them to return to nations still struggling with widespread insecurity and instability is both inhumane and counterproductive.”\n\nMiami-Dade County Commissioner Marleine Bastien called on Congress to pass legislation to grant permanency to families with TPS.\n\n“Once again, this abrupt and shortsighted reversal puts families at risk of separation and creates unnecessary fear and instability in cities like ours, where TPS recipients are vital members of the workforce and economy,” Bastien said in a statement.\n\nBastien’s concerns are deeply personal for longtime Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders living in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, whose families now face the threat of separation and loss of stability.\n\nGuevara’s grandson, Dubon, said his family fears she will lose all the retirement benefits she earned.\n\n“All she ever did was work,” he said. “It’s just unfair.”",

    "News_title":"This family lost their home in the Texas floods. Like most victims of storm, they didn’t have flood insurance",
    "News_text":"Crissy and Avi Eliashar bought their home in Jonestown, Texas, 13 years ago. They never had a problem with flooding until water washed away their home, car and all their possessions early Saturday morning.\n\nAvi, a security guard, was at work when the water rapidly filled their mobile home. That left Crissy, a school teacher, barely any time to escape with their three children – sons Beni, age 12; Dov, age 10; and 7-year old daughter Mayaan – along with her son’s friend who was spending the night. Mayaan was saved from being sw ept away in the flood waters by her brother Dov grabbing onto her hair.\n\n“We nearly died. We were very lucky,” said Crissy Eliashar.\n\nBut while Eliashar is grateful no one was lost or seriously injured, that doesn’t remove the pain of the losses the family did suffer. Like many of the victims of last week’s flooding in Texas, the Eliashars do not have flood insurance. And homeowners’ insurance very rarely covers damage from flood waters.\n\n“It was our everything,” Crissy Eliashar said about the home. “It was our stability. We owned it outright. We raised my babies there, and it kind of gave us, you know, the kind of life we live. Now we have to reframe our entire life.”\n\nFEMA estimates that only 4% of homes nationwide have flood insurance, and even high risk areas lack wide coverage. The nation’s insurance industry has essentially walked away from the business over cost and risk, ceding coverage to a government program that requires homeowners to pay extra for protection they might only need in the case of the most extreme storms.\n\n“It was not an expense we thought of as necessary,” Crissy Eliashar said. “The house was 50 years old. We’ve been here 13 years. We’ve experienced some floods in the area but even when that happened, we never had more than some water in a corner of the yard. It never got anywhere near the house.”\n\nMany mortgage lenders require that homeowners in a designated flood plain have flood insurance. The Eliashars, who had no mortgage, knew their home in a flood plain wasn’t covered.\n\nHowever, many of the flood victims in Texas only discovered their lack of coverage after the disaster washed away their homes.\n\nThey’re not alone. Only 30% of homes in what FEMA classifies as a “special flood hazard area” had flood insurance as of 2018, according to analysis by theWharton Climate Centerat the University of Pennsylvania. The percentage is likely lower today.\n\nFlood insurance coverage peaked in 2017, and has been declining steadily since then, said Rob Moore, director of the climate adaptation division of the National Resources Defense Council. He said that is partly because premiums for the policyholders most at risk have risen, but also because people are pulling back on spending due to overall inflation costs.\n\n“If you haven’t used your flood insurance in the past, it seems like something people can get by without,” he said. “There’s an obvious fallacy to that logic.”\n\nOnly 2.2% of homes in Travis County, where the Eliashars live, have flood insurance, according to data from FEMA. And only 466 homes (also about 2.2%) in the hardest hit county – Kerr County – have policies. Statewide in Texas it’s about 7%, mostly along the Gulf Coast. But even in Galveston County, the costal area which boasts the highest percentage of coverage, less than half the homes are covered.\n\nWhile many people may think they live in an area not prone to flooding, FEMA estimates that 99% of US counties have seen flooding during the last 30 years. And Moore said climate change is exposing people to more severe storms, more frequently, than occurred in the past.\n\n“Precipitation is really changing a lot, not just in frequency, but also in intensity,” he said.\n\nThe insurance industry told CNN it’s important for people to know if they have coverage for floods, and that they are likely at risk of storm damage if not.\n\n“Floods are the most common and costly natural disasters in the United States, yet flood insurance remains one of the most underutilized forms of protection,” said Loretta Worters, a spokesperson with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group. “Too often, people discover they’re uninsured only after a devastating loss. The gap between what’s needed and what’s insured is dangerously wide.”\n\nBut critics of the insurance industry say it’s wrong that flood damage isn’t covered by most homeowner policies.\n\n“This is an example of the widespread problem in the home insurance market, which is that over the years, the insurance industry has peeled off every type of coverage they can in order to boost profits,” said Carmen Balber, executive director of Consumer Watchdog, a public interest group that focuses on the insurance industry. “So flood insurance, earthquake insurance, mold coverage, you name it, the insurance industry dumps its liability, which leaves consumers in a terrible position of having to seek out multiple policies to protect their home in case of loss.”\n\nAs extreme weather becomes more common, Balber said she doesn’t expect the situation to change.\n\n“Realistically there is no political will in any legislature or Congress to require insurance companies to cover flood damage,” she said. “So consumers aren’t protected when they need it most.”\n\nThe Eliashar family is currently staying in the home of a friend who is away for a couple of weeks, and raising money on aGoFundMepage. They have been able to salvage a few items from the remains of their home, but mostly lost everything.\n\nBut while water damage to the family’s car will by covered by car insurance, home insurance does not cover the wreckage from the flood to their home, a fact that frustrates Crissy Eliashar.\n\n“I haven’t even had time to get angry,” she said. “I mean, I feel grateful for my life, but I’m starting to get angry, yeah, of course I am.”\n\n– CNN’s Mike Figliola contributed to this report\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

Among the dead were27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp along the Guadalupe River, which surged 26 feet in 45 minutes.\n\nCampos viewed photos of some of the victims at the memorial.\n\n“It makes you want to cry, it’s something very sad, because their families send their children to have a good time, to learn, to know a little more about life,” Campos said. “The families send their babies, believing that it’s something beautiful, that they’re going to have a great time, maybe in the moment yes, but then this happened.”\n\nCampos began her rescue operations training at age 15. During a mission in Acapulco, Mexico, Campos adapted techniques learned from ranch work to help rescue a man trapped in a mud-filled house when conventional methods proved too slow.\n\n“My other companions were going shovel by shovel and I proposed something else — it was the way that I clean my animals on the ranch,” she said. “That’s how we expedited the work, with something that we didn’t learn in courses but I learned in my daily life.”\n\nLos Topos volunteers receive training in first aid, navigating collapsed structures, climbing, managing search dogs and firefighting.

    "News_title":"Mount Rainier has seen hundreds of earthquakes this week. Is it safe to visit?",
    "News_text":"Over 300 minor earthquakeshave been detectedunder the surface of Mount Rainier since the morning of Tuesday, July 8.\n\nThe swarm is the first of its kind since 2009, and, according toPacific Northwest Seismic NetworkDirector Harold Tobin, the biggest swarm the organization has ever detected.\n\n“There have been something around 330 or so that our team here at PSN has actually verified and precisely located by expert analysis,” Tobin told McClatchy in a phone call. “And there are many hundreds, actually thousands more earthquakes that we can see, mostly much smaller ones, on the instrumentation.”\n\nThe early hours of the swarm brought more earthquakes than the nine that Mount Rainier would typically see over the course of a month,according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n“We were detecting numbers bigger than that per hour in this event, and even, actually, many more than that,” Tobin said.\n\nSo what does the seismic activity mean for people who are planning on visiting the mountain?\n\nThe earthquake swarm coincides with the mountain’s busy season – it welcomed over 389,000 recreational visitors last July, the most of any month,according to National Park Service data.\n\nMeilee Anderson, marketing consultant for Visit Rainier, a group that promotes tourism in the area, said that the earthquakes haven’t deterred visitors so far.\n\n“We haven’t observed any changes in visitor behavior—no noticeable rise in cancellations or decline in interest,” Anderson said in an email to McClatchy. “Summer is the peak season for travel in this region, and interest in Mount Rainier and the surrounding communities remains strong.”\n\nIf you are planning on visiting Mount Rainier, the earthquakes shouldn’t be too much of a concern – Tobin said the mountain remains as safe as usual.\n\n“My answer would be, based on what we’ve seen so far, yes, absolutely,” Tobin said. “I would unhesitatingly, personally, go for a hike or up to Paradise or be a climber [or a] mountaineer if I were able this weekend at any time, right now.”\n\nNot only have the earthquakes not been significant enough to pose a threat to hikers, Tobin said they haven’t even been noticeable from the surface.\n\n“I don’t think any of them have risen to the size that could even be felt at the surface,” Tobin said. “We really need our network of instruments to have even detected them.”\n\nIn addition to the risk posed by the earthquakes themselves,Mount Rainieris anactive volcanoand seismic activity can berelated to a potential eruption. But Tobin said there’s been no indication that this swarm of earthquakes is related to potential volcanic activity.\n\n“There’s nothing about this swarm that is a sign of actual magma on the move, which would be more concerning to us… We see different kinds of earthquakes in the case where magma is actually on the move, and we would see, probably, other signs as well,” Tobin said.\n\nInstead, Tobin thinks that the earthquakes have been caused by fluid making its way into cracks in the rock underneath the mountain’s surface.\n\n“What we think is going on is that super heated, pressurized fluid – water, essentially, that’s circulating in the Earth’s crust – has found its way into some network of small faults or fractures in the rock, and that pressurization has just triggered small slips there,” Tobin said.\n\nThe activity hasn’t caused the USGS to change their assessment of the likelihood of an eruption.\n\n“We’ll still watch and see how it develops, but what we’ve seen so far hasnot caused the USGS to change their assessmentof the volcano’s hazard level from what they call normal and green – it’s a green light, yellow light, red light kind of system,” Tobin said. “So it’s still at normal, and we see this as within the normal range of what we would call background activity for Mount Rainier.”\n\nTobin said that researchers would only begin to worry about potential volcanic activity if the magnitude of the earthquakes began to increase.\n\n“If significantly larger earthquakes happened, like high magnitude three, four, even higher, then that certainly would… be a red flag to us that maybe more is going on,” Tobin said.\n\nHowever, Tobin said that it’s most likely the activity continues to die down over the course of the week.\n\n“The rate has been reduced since the initial burst of activity in the first 12 or 24 hours of this swarm, but it’s still going on. We’re still seeing events as of the last few hours even. And the most likely scenario is that it continues to taper back to the background,” Tobin said.\n\nIf you’re concerned about earthquakes while you’re at the mountain, you can check theMount Rainier page on the USGS websitefor the latest updates.",

    "News_title":"With expired work permits, couple who fled Haiti leans on Texas church that brought them here",
    "News_text":"An immigrant couple whose employment authorization recently expired is relying on members of the Texas church that helped them flee Haiti to stay afloat while they fight deportation.\n\nSherlie and Kevenson Jean left everything behind in Haiti in 2023 as gang violence and dwindling resources took over the capital. “We chose to leave Haiti because it was unsafe — kidnapping everywhere, gang control everywhere,” said Sherlie, 29, her voice cracking. “We were living in fear … and stress.”\n\nThe Jeans legally immigrated to the United States through the humanitarian parole program during the Biden administration and later applied for Temporary Protective Status, which allows eligible foreign nationals to live and work in the United States temporarily because of unsafe conditions in their home countries.\n\nNow, the futures of both protections are in jeopardy.\n\nOn June 27, theDepartment of Homeland Securityannounced it would terminate Haiti’s TPS designation on Sept. 2 — months before its original expiration date, Feb. 3, set during the Biden administration. DHS argued that conditions in Haiti had improved and no longer warranted the special protections.\n\nBut on July 1,a federal judge in New York blocked the move, temporarily shielding more than 500,000 Haitians — including the Jeans — from immediate deportation.\n\nGang violence hasdisplaced more than 1.3 million people, with gangs controlling roughly 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, according to the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration.\n\n“Return to Haiti right now, it’s a death sentence. … The airport is shut down because of gangs,” said Kevenson, 28.\n\nDHS also recently revoked legal protections for thousands of Haitians who entered through the humanitarian parole program. That program, now under intense scrutiny, had offered entry to migrants with U.S.-based sponsors — often relatives — who could financially support them.\n\nKevenson, a truck driver, said he was forced to return his work vehicle more than a week ago after his employment authorization expired. Sherlie had to leave her job at a convenience store for the same reason.\n\n“The bills didn’t stop,” Kevenson said. “But the paycheck did.”\n\nThe couple are surviving off savings and the support of their small rural church community, some members of whom voted for President Donald Trump. The same church helped connect them to an immigration attorney as they consider seeking asylum.\n\nKevenson said that if he returns to Haiti, gang members will think he is rich. “They’ll kidnap me,” he said.\n\nSherlie said she fears becoming a target for sexual violence.\n\n“They can kidnap me, rape me,” she said. “They don’t care about if you’re going to suffer.”\n\nThe Jeans said they followed every legal step to enter the United States. Their American sponsor covered their travel, and both passed background checks.\n\nKevenson said he acknowledges that TPS was not a permanent status for immigrants, but he also said now is not the time to end it for Haitians.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended the administration’s move in a statement, calling it part of an effort to “restore sanity” to the immigration system.\n\n“Temporary Protected Status is, by definition, temporary, and is committed to the discretion of the DHS Secretary,” Jackson said. “President Trump is keeping his promise to restore sanity to our immigration system and end the Biden administration’s exploitation of these temporary programs to encourage more illegal immigration. DHS originally designated Haiti for TPS 15 years ago, following a 2010 earthquake. The 2010 earthquake no longer poses a risk to Haitians. Haitian nationals may pursue lawful status through other channels, if eligible.”\n\nKevenson said he remembers the U.S. government’s extending TPS to Haitians after the destructive earthquake. “Things was pretty bad,” he said. “And right now things are worse. Like, really worse.”\n\nThe couple said they want to build a life in America — raising children, working, contributing. Sherlie wants to become a nurse. Kevenson imagines sitting in the stands watching his future daughter cheer at Friday night football games.\n\nSherlie nodded beside him. “We’re just here to work and make our dreams come true.”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_title":"‘Larger swarm than anything we’ve seen’: Rainier quakes reach historic levels",
    "News_text":"The recent swarm of small earthquakes at Mount Rainierhas not only made national headlines but also history: Researchers have never recorded seismic activity like this before at the active stratovolcano.\n\n“It’s now a larger swarm than anything we’ve seen since we’ve been (seismic) monitoring anything at Mount Rainier,” Alex Iezzi, a research geophysicist, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nResearchers started seismic monitoring at Mount Rainier in the 1970s, according to Iezzi, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cascades Volcano Observatory and said she conferred with other seismologists to identify the origin of observations at the mountain. Prior to then, it’s unknown whether the volcano had experienced a larger swarm — a term defined as a cluster of earthquakes occurring in rapid succession in the same area.\n\nThis swarm was first reported by the USGS on Tuesday morning. Since then, there have beenhundreds of so-called volcano-tectonic earthquakesdetected relatively deep below Mount Rainier’s summit. Researchers say there’s been no cause for concern or any indications that the volcano is on the verge of eruption — something that hasn’t occurred in about 1,000 years.\n\n“Which I think is good,” Iezzi added.\n\nSince Tuesday’s roaring start, the seismic activity has significantly declined and continued to dwindle into Friday. Still, the swarm has surpassed Mount Rainier’s last large one in 2009 “in terms of magnitude, total events, event rate, and energy release,” the USGS said in a status report Thursday.\n\nMount Rainier is viewed as “potentiallythe most dangerous volcano in the Cascade Range” due, in part, to its frequent earthquakes, according to the USGS. In ordinary times, Mount Rainier sees an average of nine quakes per month and swarms once or twice every year. Only Mount St. Helens has more temblors inthe Cascade Range. Seismic activity is different in all volcanoes, and researchers are unsure why, Iezzi said.\n\nThe recent earthquakes have presented researchers with new opportunities to learn more about Mount Rainier, which Iezzi called “exciting,” even as their magnitudes have been small enough to go undetected by the public.\n\n“Even if you were standing on Mount Rainier,” Iezzi said, “you wouldn’t be able to feel these.”\n\nResearchers currently hypothesize that the swarm, as others have been in the past, can be attributed to hydrothermal fluids — very hot water and gases deep in the volcano — moving through preexisting faults beneath the mountain.\n\nWhileearthquakes can cause volcanic eruptions, there has been no evidence of a correlation in the Cascades, and researchers have not seen any troubling signs during the swarm, according to Iezzi. Such warnings would include magma moving from the depth toward the surface, rockfalls and quakes increasing in size or becoming more shallow, she said.\n\nOn its webpage about general Mount Rainier earthquake hazards, the USGS noted thatquakes could trigger landslides, leading to volcanic mudflows, known as lahars, which could be dangerous to surrounding valleys.\n\nThe agency said that the recent earthquakes are too small to pose a significant threat to hikers. A recent increase in rockfall and icefall at Mount Rainier has been attributed to warm temperatures unrelated to the swarm, it said.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, the Cascades Volcano Observatory andPacific Northwest Seismic Networkhave located 423 earthquakes since the swarm’s beginning and identified many others that it could not locate, according to the USGS. A quake can be detected by data, but it needs to be big enough and identified by enough seismometers to be pinpointed, Iezzi said.\n\nThe earthquakes were between 1.5 and 4 miles in depth, with the largest being a 2.4 magnitude on Friday afternoon, the USGS said Friday. After being detected at rates up to several per minute when the swarm began, quakes were occurring three days later at a much slower rate. Researchers officially located 30 earthquakes per hour at the swarm’s peak Tuesday but that figure had dwindled to a few per hour by Friday.\n\nBy comparison, researchers in 2009 located 120 earthquakes at Mount Rainier during a three-day swarm — the largest being a 2.5 magnitude originally identified as a 2.3 — although more than 1,000 quakes were detected, the USGS said.\n\nA 3.9-magnitude earthquake documented beneath Mountain Rainier in 1973 isthe largest on recordat the volcano, according to the agency.\n\nIezzi said it was unclear when the current swarm would come to an end, a conclusion that researchers will reach when Mount Rainier returns to normal seismic activity. When the swarm began, the USGS said it likely would continue for several days and that most swarms at the volcano last less than a week.\n\n“If the swarm lasts more than a week or so, that would be different than the last large swarm at Rainier in 2009,” the agency said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nFor Iezzi, the swarm has served as “a good reminder” that Mount Rainier is an active volcano, and she encouraged the public to keep aware of information distributed by the USGS.\n\n“These are active systems,” she said, “so we’re constantly monitoring all the volcanoes in the Cascades.”",

    "News_text":"Student loan borrowersare facing a brutal new era, as the Trump administration begins to garnish the wages of people in default, and millions who were part of a Biden-era repayment program arehit with interest paymentsonce more. The slow-motion crisis is only getting worse, but there are ways for employers to step in and help workers who are feeling the pinch.\n\nThere areseveral benefits that companies can offeremployees struggling under unwieldy debt burdens, including matching student loan contributions to retirement plans, PTO exchanges, financial planning counseling, and education assistance programs.\n\nBut half the battle for business leaders is convincing their company’s top brass that they should even offer these benefits in the first place. Only 9% of organizations offered student loan benefits in 2024, according to SHRM’semployee benefits survey. While that’s an increase from 7% in 2022, the vast majority of businesses still don’t offer any kind of assistance to employees.\n\nFortunespoke with several student loan benefit experts about how to make the case for offering the perks that are still rare, but increasingly relevant.\n\n“It’s been an evolution and the recognition that student loans are here to stay, and, quite frankly, that the student loan debt crisis is real,” says says Stacey MacPhetres, senior director of education finance for EdAssist by Bright Horizons, which offers tuition assistance and student loan repayment benefit plans. “Employers are starting to recognize that it is a necessary benefit, and no longer a nice to have.”\n\nGarnishing wages has a huge impact on personal finances, and can dramatically affect a borrower’s credit score. That can further impact someone’s ability to get a car or home loan.\n\n“It’s like an economic earthquake ripping through those who are part of our workforce that have pursued the degree to get the job in the first place,” says Laurel Taylor, CEO of Candidly, a financial wellness company. She adds it’s not just an issue only for young people or new graduates, but includes people in their 30, 40s, 50s and beyond.\n\nEmployers who acknowledge the stress that employees are under, and show up with benefits to try and address those problems, have the opportunity to cultivate a feeling of appreciation among workers.\n\n“This is a chance to demonstrate, from an employer’s perspective, empathy. To build loyalty and differentiate that employer brand in a very fiercely competitive talent market.”\n\nMany companies that choose to offer student loan assistance do so as an incentive to keep employees around, and discussing the benefit in terms of ROI can help employers make the business case for that kind of perk.\n\nEmployees with more debt are more likely to job hop—around 61% of employees without debt were willing to stay with their current employer compared to 39% of borrowers, according to areportfrom MissionSquare Research. Taylor says her clients that offer those benefits reduce turnover by an average of 33% to 58%, while employers that traditionally have higher levels of turnover, like hospitals, can see turnover reduction of 76%.\n\nOffering student loan benefits can also help a company stand out when it comes to recruiting new employees. Businesses shouldn’t be afraid to tout their offerings, especially in job ads or during candidate interviews, notes Ted Kane, a partner at insurance brokerage firm Brown & Brown.\n\n“If I’m choosing between employer A and employer B, and I’m going to get a student loan repayment, I’m going to employer A, unless there’s a big difference in salary,” he says.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of offering student loan benefits is that they’re not cheap. But there are many options out there for business owners that won’t actually cost them extra money.\n\nUnder the Secure 2.0 Act, passed in 2022, companies can take the funds they would have used to match employee retirement contributions and instead use them to help them pay off student loans. PTO exchange programs also allow employees to take any unused time off and convert it into cash for loan payments. Finally, employers can offer to turn a sign-on bonus into a monthly student loan contribution over a number of years, according to MacPhetres. These kinds of programs tend to be an easier sell for leadership, because the money is already budgeted.\n\nWhile student loan benefits are still offered by a minority of companies, experts say they’re gaining steam.\n\n“It used to be that companies would give access to refinancing, maybe as part of a voluntary benefit platform. But now they’re looking to actually repay the loans,” says Kane, who estimates around half of employers he comes into contact with are at least thinking about these perks.\n\nWhen wage garnishment begins, companies will be confronted more directly with the severity of their workers’ financial situations, says MacPhetres. Student loan benefits today are where retirement savings accounts were in the 1980s, she adds. Something that’s nice to have now, but will one day turn into absolute must.\n\n“This is something that comes up in every conversation with employees as they’re navigating their futures, and I think employers are starting to take notice.”\n\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com",

    "News_text":"School principal Yoshiro Tobo is one of the few people left on his remote Japanese island, where the earth is constantly shaking from earthquakes, having chosen to stay behind while his family are on safer ground.\n\nThe 52-year-old said he is exhausted and frightened to sleep, as “endless” quakes rumble around Akusekijima in the Tokara Islands, which have endured more than 1,800 earthquakes in the past three weeks.\n\nHis colleagues were among 49 evacuees, about 75% of the population, who were evacuated to the mainland by ferry on Sunday after the strongest quake hit on July 3, toppling furniture and making it difficult to stand, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.\n\nTobo, however, told CNN how he stayed behind as gatekeeper of the island’s only school, now an evacuation center.\n\n“It has been shaking repeatedly for many days. I’ve been feeling very anxious and scared and it’s difficult to sleep,” he said.\n\n“At their worst, the earthquakes seem endless. I can sense when a big one is coming. Even in my sleep, I can feel it approaching from a distance.”\n\nIn an emergency evacuation on Sunday, Tobo opened the school playground to the other 19 remaining islanders and five contractors, providing an open space away from any buildings which could be felled by the tremors. So far, the school remains unscathed.\n\n“I evacuated at around midnight and went back to bed around 1:30 a.m., but I could not sleep enough. Some of the quakes were very strong,” he added.\n\nBut he said the responsibility comes with the job.\n\n“As school administrator, I’ve chosen to stay on the island and support the effort by coordinating with government officials and local residents,” said Tobo, whose family live on mainland Kyushu island.\n\n“I stay home at night but I always feel ready to evacuate (to the school) at any moment, even in the middle of the night.”\n\nTakashi Arikawa, an official at Toshima Village Office which manages the region, said the community is “sleep deprived” and “exhausted” from “constant earthquakes that have continued day and night.”\n\nAs well as Tobo, the people still on the island include firefighters, farmers, power company workers, one doctor and one nurse.\n\nTobo’s students resumed lessons on Tuesday via online classes. It follows a period where children were walking to school in helmets as a precaution, and the school was closed for two days.\n\n“Until then, some children were still on the island,” the principal said. “They seemed anxious and frightened by the ongoing earthquakes. I did my best to encourage and reassure them.\n\n“We pray that those who remain on the island stay safe and that their homes are spared from damage.”\n\nOn neighboring Kodakarajima – which like Akusekijima is one of Tokara’s seven inhabited islands – local authorities confirmed 15 residents have been evacuated and 44 remain along with four contractors.\n\nKozo Matsuno, the island’s school principal who also stayed behind, said all supermarkets and stores were originally closed and daily necessities are still being delivered by ferry from Kagoshima.\n\nBut he expressed optimism, after days of sleepless nights, saying “the intervals between earthquakes have become longer.”\n\n“The earthquakes seem to be subsiding gradually, and I hope this continues,” he told CNN.\n\nMatsuno confirmed that all students are “in good health,” with half attending classes online after evacuating and the other half continuing in person.\n\nThe approximately 700 inhabitants of the 12-island archipelago appear well versed in such procedures. One school website shows children sheltering under their desks during a drill in Akusekijima last month.\n\nIn addition to the strongest quake on July 3, the region has experienced 128 level-three quakes, according to Japan’s unique, seven-level Shindo intensity scale, categorizing them as strong enough to wake sleeping people.\n\nThere have also been at least 39 at level four, felt by most people walking; four at level five, where windows could shatter; and three at upper five, where it’s difficult to move without support.\n\nThe region has experienced long periods of tremors before, with one significant event in 2023 bringing 346 recorded quakes.\n\nOfficials said there is currently no tsunami risk, but cautioned that the ground remains unstable, according to local media. Residents have been warned of the possibility of collapsing buildings and landslides.\n\nJapan’s government on Saturday warned of more possible strong earthquakes in the area, but urged the public not to believe unfounded comic book predictions of amajor disasterstriking the country on July 5.\n\nThis stems from rumors inspired bythe manga“The Future I Saw,” which warns of a major disaster in March 2011, a date which turned out to coincide with theearthquake and tsunamithat hit Japan’s northern Tohoku region that month, which caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nThe “complete version,” released in 2021, claims that the next big earthquake will hit this July.\n\nEarthquakes are common in Japan, which accounts for about one-fifth of the world’s tremors of magnitude 6 or greater.\n\nThe country sits on the so-called Ring of Fire, home to 75% of the world’s active volcanoes, where roughly 90% of all earthquakes occur. Stretching almost 25,000 miles, the horseshoe-shaped Ring of Fire encircles most of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis is where many tectonic plates meet and move against each other, causing friction that releases energy and creates the shaking that is unleashed during an earthquake.\n\nHanako Montgomery contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

And as far as vibrancy, after 5 p.m., the city emptied out.\n\nRacial tensions andcivil unrestrobbed the city of liveliness even before theGreat Recession of 2008.\n\nBut that started to change around 2010 as OTR quickly becamea hub for the city’s culinary life.\n\nOne early restaurant that popped up around that time wasTaste of Belgium, which opened its first bistro in OTR in 2011.

    "News_title":"The Hotel Oloffson Was a ‘Safe Haven’ in Haiti. Gang Wars Have Turned It to Ashes",
    "News_text":"Tucked away in a hillside garden a short walk from the restive heart of Port-au-Prince, the Hotel Oloffson was a strange kind of refuge. Through good years and a lot of bad ones, it stayed open to all comers, welcoming despite its dark undertones and somehow immune to Haiti’s political strife. A favorite haunt of artists, celebrities, and local intelligentsia, along with aid workers and journalists needing a stiff rum punch to ease the day’s stress, the Gothic gingerbread mansion weathered brutal bouts of violence and natural disasters to become the most storied hotel in the Caribbean. Mick Jagger and Jackie Kennedy Onassis were guests, and it was a centerpiece in Graham Greene’s classic novelTheComediansabout the terrors of dictatorship. Later, it was reborn as a bohemian jam-hall where diverse crowds pulsed to Vodou-rock rhythms deep into the night. After the 2010 earthquake leveled much of the capital, the Oloffson was one of the few hotels left standing. The music went on. And the faithful kept coming back, even as the country descended into lawlessness.\n\nLast weekend, the armed gangs that have a stranglehold on Port-au-Prince burned the hotel to the ground. In recent months the gangs have attacked schools, hospitals, libraries, a historic radio station, and the offices of the country’s oldest newspaper, part of a “very clear and obvious effort to erase all these institutions,” says Haitian American writer Edwidge Danticat, who grew up poor in the capital’s Bel Air neighborhood. “[The Oloffson] was a bridge — a space for connection where different worlds could meet.” While the hotel may be just one more building, “it’s a symbol of something that once might have been left alone,” she adds. “If this place that is so well-known — an international treasure — could not be protected, how much protection is there for ordinary people in Port-au-Prince right now?”\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nJudge Blocks Trump's Bid to Deny Migrants Asylum\n\nMy Best Friend's Murder Was a Tabloid Circus. Now, I'm Looking for the Truth\n\nTear Gas, Human Stampedes, and ICE Raids: 100 Hours in L.A.\n\nOwner Richard Morse toldRolling Stonethe Oloffson had been closed since March, when members of the Viv Ansanm (Live Together) gang alliance raided the property after gun battles with police that had forced area residents and hotel staff to flee. Morse still hoped to reopen one day. But after watching a social media video of the hotel aflame in the night, he asked a friend to do a drone flyover to check it out. “When he called me back, he said, ‘I think you better have a seat,’”says Morse. Aerial footage revealed a smoldering ruin.\n\nThe sudden, total loss was a gut punch to the Morse family and generations of hotel patrons who enjoyed camaraderie and music at the Oloffson, no matter the troubles beyond its walls. “We’re heartbroken,” says Isabelle Morse, Richard’s daughter. “It touched so many people: artists, journalists, writers, rich, poor, Black, white, local, international, gay, straight — it was home to all. Everyone has a piece of memory attached to it, and they have no place to go anymore. It feels like somebody died.” Filmmaker Richard Sénécal put it bluntly in a post on X: “What nature couldn’t destroy in nearly a century, barbarism and savagery by our fellow Haitians burned it down in one night.”\n\nThe United Nations estimates the gangs now control 90 percent of the capital, which edges closer to collapse in a vacuum of international apathy and government infighting. Kenyan forces deployed to assist national police have had little impact, undermanned and outgunned by high-powered weapons smuggled in from the U.S. and the Dominican Republic. Nearly 5,000 people have been killed in the past nine months. And with the gangs expanding into new parts of the country, more than 1.3 million are uprooted from their homes, the highest total on record. Soaring costs and drastic aid cuts have left a million children to suffer critical levels of food insecurity.\n\n“So much devastation in the country, so many people getting killed, so many people getting raped — and so many people focusing on a hotel,” Morse says by phone from his home in Maine. “A lot of things are making me really angry. But I guess the bottom line is: If the hotel is going to attract attention to the people that need it, then I guess that’s a positive thing.”\n\nFew establishments are as steeped in history and political intrigue. Built in the late 19th century, it was initially a private residence for the Sams, a powerful family that produced two Haitian presidents, one of whose killing at the hands of a mob spurred the U.S. military to intervene. During the 19-year occupation, it was used as a hospital by Marines until forces withdrew and Werner Gustav Oloffson, a Swedish sea captain, converted the grounds into a hotel in 1935. The Grand Hotel Oloffson, as it was then known, became jet-set famous after the 1950s, when a French photographer bought the hotel and attracted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Tennessee Williams, and Graham Greene, some whose names adorned the guest rooms.\n\nGreene immortalized the hotel inThe Comedians, a haunting novel about life under dictator François “Papa Doc” Duvalier and his dreaded paramilitary goons, the Tonton Macoute. “With its towers and balconies and wooden fretwork decorations it had the air at night of a Charles Addams house in a number ofThe New Yorker,” Greene wrote. “You expected a witch to open the door to you or a maniac butler, with a bat dangling from the chandelier behind him.” The book was adapted into a 1967 film starring Taylor and Richard Burton, but Hollywood glamor was no match for the Duvalier nightmare. When tourism to Haiti dried up, the hotel was left to resident aid workers and journalists, and Aubelin Jolicoeur, the dapper Haitian newspaper columnist who inspired the Greene character “Petit Pierre.” Impossible to miss in a white linen suit and paisley ascot, Jolicoeur was a fixture at the hotel for four decades — an in-house attraction who trafficked in gossip and signaled his arrival each day by tapping the floor with his gold-tipped cane.\n\nMorse took over the lease in 1987 after the fall of the Duvalier regime. The son of a Caribbean scholar and a beloved Haitian entertainer, Morse says he’d learned how to mix art and business while working in New York for Steve Rubell, the co-founder of Studio 54, and set about transforming the Oloffson into a vibrant cultural space. Dropping the “Grand” from the hotel’s name to make it more democratic, he renovated the mahogany bar, added more rooms, and installed a Haitian roots-music band that he named RAM, after his initials. As songwriter-cum-conductor, Morse helmed a rotating cast of musicians and dancers. His future wife, Lunise, became lead female vocalist. (His son William later joined as lead guitarist.)\n\nBy the early 1990s, RAM’s Thursday night concerts were wildly popular, marathon affairs charged with increasingly brazen protests against the military junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. “The band thought, ‘Man, we are invincible,’ you know? ‘We can say whatever we want because no one’s messing with us,’” recalls Morse. “And then at some point in ‘94 they started threatening us. People started following us around thinking that the [U.S.] invasion would be triggered by me getting killed.” That September, 25,000 U.S. troops surged into Haiti to restore democracy and the hotel enjoyed its most profitable run, though trouble was never far. A 1998 assassination attempt during Kanaval claimed the lives of eight supporters.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2010, Haiti was hit with a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and destroyed vast swaths of the capital. Damaged but unbroken, the Oloffson emerged as a hub for relief workers and journalists who poured in from around the world. Morse served as an essential source of information on RAM’s Twitter feed, and held a free concert three months after the quake on the hotel lawn; thousands showed up. The band would continue to perform regularly to a packed house, a steady drumbeat for Haiti’s recovery. The Oloffson stage also hosted big-name performers, from Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Jackson Browne to Jimmy Buffett and Arcade Fire. “Hotel Oloffson was a hotel on the surface, but it was really a temple, a refuge at the crossroads of culture, music, and social justice,” says Arcade Fire’s Régine Chassagne. “It was an inn for the NGO workers and writers, people passing through, who all had Haiti at heart.”\n\nAs reconstruction staggered along, armed gangs thrived during the 2011 to 2016 presidency of Michel Martelly. A cousin of Morse’s, Martelly armed and financed gangs to extend his power and traffic drugs, laying some of the groundwork for the plague that now grips the country. (Morse served for a time in Martelly’s administration but quit in 2013, citing corruption and mismanagement.) Morse says the Oloffson was deemed to be in a high-risk “red zone,” and foreign staff were either forbidden or discouraged from patronizing the hotel. The July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse plunged the country into greater chaos. And the Covid-19 pandemic brought business to a standstill.\n\nDuring a May 2023 trip toreport on the gang war, I stopped by the hotel one afternoon for lunch. Its iron gates remained open and unguarded, the courtyard overgrown and prowled by dogs. The familiar statue of Baron Samedi, Vodou’s top hat-wearing master of the dead, greeted me at the base of the staircase, but the bar was empty save for Madame Jeudy, its stalwart manager. I ordered a plate ofpoulet créoleand wandered around the dining room taking in the art and curios. Out on the balcony a painter was at work touching up the facade, a small hedge against the decay. It didn’t matter that the food took an hour to arrive. A faint sea breeze cut the heat, and I was glad to be off the streets.\n\n“The Oloffson was always a safe haven,” says Neil Brandvold, an American filmmaker who had to run from trouble in Port-au-Prince on more than one occasion over the years. “As long as you got through the front gates of the Oloffson, everyone left you alone. Just the respect for Richard and the hotel as an institution … It was sort of protected from the gangs and their violence.” On Brandvold’s last visit, in late 2023, however, some attempted kidnappings in the municipal cemetery forced him to cut filming short. He holed up in the hotel for several days with a photographer watching gunfights flare through the night. “I think we were the last people to stay there.”\n\nIn February, I ran into Morse at a heavily guarded hotel in Pétionville, a suburb of the capital. Commercial flights had been shut down for months, and travel around Port-au-Prince was a roll of the dice. Morse told me he’d nevertheless walked down to the Oloffson out of habit, stopping to take selfies with fans along the way, until friends insisted it was too dangerous to go back again. Most members of RAM have since relocated to the northern city of Cap Haitien to keep making music. For his part, Morse released a new song the day before the Oloffson burned down, titled, “We Want Justice.” A cry for Haiti, and all that’s wrong in the world.\n\n“He’s devastated — probably the most devastated of us all,” says Isabelle Morse. “That was our living room. The music, the characters, the people who kept coming back, all that he did to keep it alive and make it this place of resistance and freedom in a place that’s so hard to do that. He spent his whole life doing it. And now it’s gone.”\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nEvery Super Bowl Halftime Show, Ranked From Worst to Best\n\nThe United States of Weed\n\nGaming Levels Up\n\nSign up forRollingStone's Newsletter.

    "News_title":"Winner of Olympia’s biggest tree contest was a last-minute entry. Here’s how to see them",
    "News_text":"Just two months ago, the largest tree in Olympia was believed to be one that kids on the west side call the Garfield cat tree. From the nearby school playground the coast redwood’s split crown resembles a set of triangular ears, which stem from four separate trees that share a trunk measuring 30 feet in circumference.\n\nBut that tree has been surpassed in a competition spearheaded by local nonprofit Restoring Earth Connection to help document the largest tree in each neighborhood, as well as the largest of each species. The work was done through an Inspire Olympia grant.\n\nThe largest tree has been identified as a Giant Sequoia that measures 31 feet and 11 inches in circumference.\n\nYou can view photos of the largest trees and find out where they’re located onRestoring Earth Connection’s website. Unfortunately, the owner of the largest tree doesn’t want to disclose the location of their property — it’s in the northeast quadrant of the city, however.\n\nThe second-largest tree is the Garfield tree, located at 1701 Fourth Ave. SW. People are encouraged to check out the trees, but do so from a distance and avoid walking onto private property.\n\nFollowing the winning Giant Sequoia, the second-largest tree in northeast Olympia is a coast redwood that measures 25 feet and 11 inches in circumference. It’s at 2116 Bethel St. NE.\n\nThe largest tree with a location listed in the southeast quadrant of Olympia is a set of coast redwoods that measure 21 and 22 feet at their bases. They’re at 1811 Eskridge Blvd. SE.\n\nIn downtown and north of I-5, the largest tree is another pair of trees, this time two Giant Sequoias that measure 21 and 22 feet at their bases. They’re located at the corner of State Avenue and Turner Street.\n\nThe second-largest redwood can be seen on the west side of town at 826 Percival St. SW. Its base measures 27 feet and 4 inches in circumference.\n\nExecutive Director Lynn Fitz-Hugh said the contest is the culmination of a 5-month canvassing effort to share with Olympia residents the benefits of the trees on their property. She said benefits include drawing down pollution, drawing down and storing carbon to help combat climate change, managing storm water to prevent flooding, reducing heat islands and more.\n\n“Because the biggest trees do the most carbon drawdown and storage, the most pollution drawdown and the most storm water management, we really focused on finding the biggest trees and thus held a contest for the biggest trees in Olympia,” she said.\n\nFitz-Hugh shared some anecdotes about the contest winners. She said the Percival Street property with the redwood has been owned by the same man for 50 years.\n\nThe tree split into two parts about 15 feet up, and during a windstorm one side broke. A neighbor said she thought there was an earthquake when the giant tree hit the ground. The tree avoided the owner’s house, and the owner joked that the tree continues to protect him.\n\nFitz-Hugh said many of the big-tree owners felt their trees protected them, but some also expressed concern about the possibility of failures and their homes being damaged. Hiring an arborist for a tree assessment isn’t cheap, but Fitz-Hugh recommends connecting with one if there are any concerns. You can find a licensed arborist inyour region online.\n\nShe said the nonprofit also learned that almost without exception, the biggest trees in Olympia were on properties owned by elderly residents or they were rental properties. She said that means all those big trees are at risk, because when those homeowners die or when a rental property sells, there’s no telling what a developer will do.\n\n“This is how a lot of really big trees in Seattle are coming down right now,” Fitz-Hugh said. “So this has some interesting implications for Olympia, which is intending to redo their tree code this year.”",

    "News_title":"Opinion | Trump's anti-immigrant policies might have set off a political earthquake",
    "News_text":"Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has been on an anti-immigrant tear. With billions of dollars in newfunding for his mass deportation goalsrecently approved, the tools are there to escalate his crackdown even further. But anew poll from Gallupshows just how badly his heavy-handed policies have soured with Americans.\n\nI wrote last month aboutTrump’s weakening numbers on immigration. While it was still his “strongest issue” in June’sNBC News poll, it was still not an overwhelming seal of approval from the electorate. Othersurveys conductedduring and after the protests in Los Angeles and the harsh federal response showed those numbersslacking furtheras the spotlight shone on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s widening scope.\n\nIf those polls were a tremor, the survey that Gallup released Friday has the potential to be a political earthquake. In the face of a constant barrage of dark rhetoric from the White House, Americans showed themselves across multiple questions to be more open and accepting of immigration than they have been in years.\n\nFor the past 50 years, Gallup has measured Americans’ preferred rate of immigration based on three options: “should immigration be kept at its present level, increased or decreased?”\n\nLast year, 55% of Americans said that immigration rates should be decreased. Now, that number has dropped down to 30%, the same as it was in 2021, when those rates began to climb. Another 38% of Americans think it should be kept at the same level, up from 26% last year, and 26% think it should be increased — a 10-point jump from the same time in 2024.\n\nThe shift seen among Republicans and independents is particularly noteworthy, as Gallup analyst Lydia Saad wrote:\n\nWith illegal immigration levels down dramatically and refugee programs suspended, the desire for less immigration has fallen among all party groups, but it is most pronounced among Republicans, down 40 percentage points over the past year to 48%. Among independents, this sentiment is down 21 points to 30%, and among Democrats, down 12 points to 16%. Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration. Independents are most likely to favor maintaining current levels, while a plurality of Democrats favor increasing it.\n\nAt the same time, a record-high 79% of Americans now say that immigration is good for the country, compared to a record-low 17% who say otherwise. Accordingly, we’re also seeing a broader shift in support away from enforcement policies against undocumented immigrants and towarda pathway to citizenshipfor them. This poll showed 78% of all people surveyed supporting the latter, an 8-point jump. But crucially, there’s now a majority of support among self-identifiedRepublicans(59%!) for a pathway to citizenship.\n\nOn the one hand, these numbers taken in tandem could be a sign that Americans consider Trump’s immigration policies to be effective — to a point. While there’s often a gap between perceived rates of immigration and actual border crossings, there has been asubstantial plummet in border encountersreported since January. Some administrations might see this desire to freeze things at their current lower rates as a victory and choose to maintain the new status quo. The imminent threat of overreach that these polls portend would also likely give most presidential administrations pause.\n\nButthisadministration is just gearing up, as the architect of Trump’s immigration policies,White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, encourages a further uptick in the number of ICE arrests and deportations. As a true ideologue, he is unlikely to be deterred by these or other poll numbers in his quest to expel millions of immigrants — but his boss is a bit more sensitive to the swings of the electorate.\n\nTrump originally latched on to anti-immigration sentiments in part because of the response it drew from his nascent MAGA base. Concerns among the restaurant and agriculture industries prompted him to hit the brakes on some unpopular raids, before reversing himself. The growing backlash that the Gallup poll suggests might be the nudge that Trump needs to put the untethered Miller back onto his leash.\n\nThis article was originally published onMSNBC.com",

    "News_title":"The Texas flash flood is a preview of the chaos to come",
    "News_text":"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up forThe Big Story newsletterto receive stories like this one in your inbox.\n\nOn July 4, the broken remnants of a powerful tropical storm spun off the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico so heavy with moisture that it seemed to stagger under its load. Then, colliding with another soggy system sliding north off the Pacific, the storm wobbled and its clouds tipped, waterboarding south central Texas with an extraordinary 20 inches of rain. In the predawn blackness, the Guadalupe River, which drains from the Hill Country, rose by more than 26 vertical feet in just 45 minutes, jumping its banks and hurtling downstream, killing 109 people, including at least 27 children at a summer camp located inside a federally designated floodway.\n\nOver the days and weeks to come there will be tireless — and warranted — analysis of who is to blame for this heart-wrenching loss. Should Kerr County, where most of the deaths occurred, have installed warning sirens along that stretch of the waterway, and why were children allowed to sleep in an area prone to high-velocity flash flooding? Why were urgent updates apparently only conveyed by cellphone and online in a rural area with limited connectivity? Did the National Weather Service, enduring steep budget cuts under the current administration, adequately forecast this storm?\n\nThose questions are critical. But so is a far larger concern: The rapid onset of disruptive climate change — driven by the burning of oil, gasoline and coal — is making disasters like this one more common, more deadly and far more costly to Americans, even as the federal government is running away from the policies and research that might begin to address it.\n\nPresidentLyndon B. Johnson was briefedin 1965 that a climate crisis was being caused by burning fossil fuels and was warned that it would create the conditions for intensifying storms and extreme events, and this country — including 10 more presidents — has debated how to respond to that warning ever since. Still, it took decades for the slow-motion change to grow large enough to affect people’s everyday lives and safety and for the world to reach the stage it is in now: an age of climate-driven chaos, where the past is no longer prologue and the specific challenges of the future might be foreseeable but are less predictable.\n\nClimate change doesn’t chart a linear path where each day is warmer than the last. Rather, science suggests that we’re now in an age of discontinuity, with heat one day and hail the next and with more dramatic extremes. Across the planet, dry places are getting drier while wet places are getting wetter. The jet stream — the band of air that circulates through the Northern Hemisphere — is slowing to a near stall at times, weaving off its tracks, causing unprecedented events like polar vortexes drawing arctic air far south. Meanwhile the heat is sucking moisture from the drought-plagued plains of Kansas only to dump it over Spain, contributing to last year’s cataclysmic floods.\n\nWe saw something similar when Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 60 inches of rain on parts of Texas in 2017 and when Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina last year — and countless times in between. We witnessed it again in Texas this past weekend. Warmer oceans evaporate faster, and warmer air holds more water, transporting it in the form of humidity across the atmosphere, until it can’t hold it any longer and it falls. Meteorologists estimate that the atmosphere had reached its capacity for moisture before the storm struck.\n\nThe disaster comes during a week in which extreme heat and extreme weather have battered the planet. Parts of northern Spain and southern France are burning out of control, as are parts of California. In the past 72 hours, storms have torn the roofs off of five-story apartment buildings in Slovakia, while intense rainfall has turned streets into rivers in southern Italy. Same story in Lombok, Indonesia, where cars floated like buoys, and in eastern China, where an inland typhoon-like storm sent furniture blowing down the streets like so many sheafs of paper. Léon, Mexico, was battered by hail so thick on Monday it covered the city in white. And North Carolina is, again, enduring 10 inches of rainfall.\n\nThere is no longer much debate that climate change is making many of these events demonstrably worse. Scientists conducting a rapid analysis of last week’s extreme heat wave that spread across Europe have concluded that human-caused warming killed roughly 1,500 more people than might have otherwise perished. Early reports suggest that the flooding in Texas, too, was substantially influenced by climate change. According toa preliminary analysisby ClimaMeter, a joint project of the European Union and the French National Centre for Scientific Research, the weather in Texas was 7% wetter on July 4 than it was before climate change warmed that part of the state, and natural variability alone cannot explain “this very exceptional meteorological condition.”\n\nThat the United States once again is reeling from familiar but alarming headlines and body counts should not be a surprise by now. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the number of extreme weather disasters has jumped fivefold worldwide over the past 50 years, and the number of deaths has nearly tripled. In the United States, which prefers to measure its losses in dollars, the damage from major storms was more than $180 billion last year, nearly 10 times the average annual toll during the 1980s, after accounting for inflation. These storms have now cost Americans nearly $3 trillion. Meanwhile, the number of annual major disasters has grown sevenfold. Fatalities in billion-dollar storms last year alone were nearly equal to the number of such deaths counted by the federal government in the 20 years between 1980 and 2000.\n\nThe most worrisome fact, though, may be that the warming of the planet has scarcely begun. Just as each step up on the Richter scale represents a massive increase in the force of an earthquake, the damage caused by the next 1 or 2 degrees Celsius of warming stands to be far greater than that caused by the 1.5 degrees we have so far endured. The world’s leading scientists, the United Nations panel on climate change and even many global energy experts warn that we face something akin to our last chance before it is too late to curtail a runaway crisis. It’s one reason our predictions and modeling capabilities are becoming an essential, lifesaving mechanism of national defense.\n\nWhat is extraordinary is that at such a volatile moment, President Donald Trump’s administration would choose not just to minimize the climate danger — and thus the suffering of the people affected by it — but to revoke funding for the very data collection and research that would help the country better understand and prepare for this moment.\n\nOver the past couple of months, the administration hasdefunded much of the operations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation’s chief climate and scientific agency responsible for weather forecasting, as well as the cutting-edge earth systems research at places like Princeton University, which is essential to modeling an aberrant future. It has canceled the nation’s seminal scientific assessment of climate change and risk. The administration has defunded the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s core program paying for infrastructure projects meant to prevent major disasters from causing harm, and it has threatened to eliminate FEMA itself, the main federal agency charged with helping Americans after a climate emergency like the Texas floods. It has — as of last week — signed legislation that unravels the federal programs meant to slow warming by helping the country’s industries transition to cleaner energy. And it has even stopped the reporting of the cost of disasters, stating that doing so is “in alignment with evolving priorities” of the administration. It is as if the administration hopes that making the price tag for the Kerr County flooding invisible would make the events unfolding there seem less devastating.\n\nGiven the abandonment of policy that might forestall more severe events like the Texas floods by reducing the emissions that cause them, Americans are left to the daunting task of adapting. In Texas, it is critical to ask whether the protocols in place at the time of the storm were good enough. This week is not the first time that children have died in a flash flood along the Guadalupe River, andreports suggestcounty officials struggled to raise money and then declined to install a warning system in 2018 in order to save approximately $1 million. But the country faces a larger and more daunting challenge, because this disaster — like the firestorms in Los Angeles and the hurricanes repeatedly pummeling Florida and the southeast — once again raises the question of where people can continue to safely live. It might be that in an era of what researchers are calling “mega rain” events, a flood plain should now be off-limits.",

    "News_text":"View looking northwest at a new thermal pool in the Porcelain Basin area of Norris Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, that probably formed in a series of mildly explosive events between late December 2024 and early February 2025. The rocks and white material (silica mud) surrounding the pool were probably ejected as the feature formed. The pool is about 4 meters (13 feet) across. (U.S. Geological Survey photo by Mike Poland, May 12, 2025.)\n\nOn April 10, 2025, geologists from Yellowstone National Park were conducting routine maintenance of temperature logging stations at Norris Geyser Basin—their first such visit to the area since the previous fall.\n\nWhen what to their wondering eyes did appear, but a blue water spring that was new since last year!\n\nThe new pool they found is located in the Porcelain Basin sub-basin of Norris Geyser Basin, immediately west of a patch of vegetation informally known as “Tree Island.” It is about 4 meters (13 feet) across, and the water in the pool was warm (about 43°C, or 109°F), light blue in color, and about 30 centimeters (1 foot) below the rim.\n\nThey spoke not a word and went straight to their work, as this was a job that they would not shirk.\n\nThe geologists found that the pool was surrounded by numerous small rocks as large as 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) across, and the rocks themselves were covered by light-gray, fine-grained, sandy mud.  There also appeared to be two layers exposed in the sides of the pool, but the lower “layer” was just a coating left on the steep side of the pool when the water was at a higher level.\n\nWith all of this evidence of quite a commotion, they knew they had found ahydrothermal explosion!\n\nThat there might have been a hydrothermal explosion at Norris Geyser Basin is not surprising, given that the thermal basin has been the site of numerous such events.  Some,like a crater in The Gap subbasin, probably occurred before people were documenting the area and have an unknown age. Others, like the1989 explosion of Porkchop Geyser, were well observed.  And thanks to anew monitoring station installed in September 2023, explosions can now be detected by geophysical data, including anexplosion in the Porcelain Terrace area in April 15, 2024, that left a crater a few meters (several feet) across.\n\nSo when did this feature near Tree Island form?  Might it have been associated with an earthquake swarm?\n\nOne tool that can be used to investigate thermal changes at Yellowstone ishigh-resolution satellite imagery.  Although these data aren’t useful at night or during cloudy conditions, the daytime, cloud-free images provide exceptional views of the ground.  The satellite data indicate that there was no feature present on the west side of Tree Island prior to Dec. 19, 2024.  By Jan. 6, 2025, a small depression had formed in that area.  An image from Feb. 13, 2025, shows the water pool, indicating that the feature had fully developed by that time.\n\nAnother helpful tool for assessing hydrothermal activity in Norris Geyser Basin is the new monitoring station that was installed in September 2023 and that usesinfrasound—low frequency acoustic energy—to detect hydrothermal activity.  Not only can infrasound arrays “hear” explosions, but they can also tell the direction from which the sound originated!  Interestingly, there were no strong and unambiguous explosion signals during the time over which satellite imagery indicate the feature formed.  There were, however, several low-level acoustic signals that came from the direction of the new feature.  The most obvious such signal was recorded on Dec. 25, 2024, but it was relatively weak, and there was no associated seismic signal—something that would be expected from a significant explosion.  Similar acoustic signals were recorded on Jan. 15 and Feb. 11, but again there were no seismic signals.\n\nWhat does this combination of data all mean?  Could it be used to investigate the scene?\n\nClearly the new thermal feature did not form in a single major explosive event, like the one ofApril 15, 2025, in Norris Geyser Basinor the well-observed event ofJuly 23, 2024, at Biscuit Basinnear Old Faithful.  Rather, it appears that the feature formed via multiple small events that initially threw rocks and later threw silica mud a short distance, creating a small pit that became filled with silica-rich water.  The feature probably started to develop on Dec. 25, 2024, with further activity occurring in mid-late January and early February 2025.\n\nThe latest new thermal feature in Norris Geyser Basin—perhaps the most dynamic area in Yellowstone National Park—demonstrates the spectrum of ways in which hydrothermal features evolve.  Some form during brief and violent episodes of change.  Others may take shape far more gradually, like the new feature found near Tree Island that seems to have begun taking shape on Christmas 2024.\n\nThat’s the story from Norris, what a sight!  And it seems to have started on Christmas night.\n\n————-\n\nYellowstoneCalderaChronicles is a weekly column written by scientists and collaborators of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.

(WIVB) — Dozens of local residents showed up to Tuesday’s common council meeting in Dunkirk to learn more about new nuclear technology and its potential to repurpose the shuttered NRG energy site.\n\nThe room was split, with some residents who are concerned about health risks and others who are calling the possibility of a nuclear power plant a needed economic boom for a “dying city.”\n\n“We will not move forward with any proposals unless it is shaped by and supported by this community,” Dunkirk Mayor Kate Wdowiasz said.\n\nIn June, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that New York would build the country’s first advanced nuclear power plant in more than a decade. While no site has been named, State Senator George Borrellohas calledto put the site in Dunkirk on the former NRG power plant, which has been closed for almost a decade.\n\n“[It was] a turning point for our community,” Wdowiasz said. “One that resulted in the loss of good paying jobs, significant tax revenue and a proud role in empowering this region.”\n\nWdowiasz said the potential site would “transform the local economy.” She invited Dr. Andrew Whittaker, a professor of civil, structural and environmental engineering at the University at Buffalo, to the meeting to discuss how nuclear energy works.\n\n“If you’re going to spend $13 billion on a plant here in Dunkirk, and you make that decision, you’re going to spend $7.5 billion of that here,” Whittaker said. “That is a shot in the arm for any community.”\n\nSome residents cited high costs and potential safety risks as reasoning for not wanting it in their backyards.\n\nOne resident voiced concerns of low-level radiation and mentioned the number of homes that are within a mile of the power plant.\n\n“You get a much greater dose just getting on a plane and traveling from Buffalo to New York City,” Whittaker said.\n\n“If there’s any earthquake or something like that, I’m worried about the nuclear waste possibly getting into our ground water,” another resident said.\n\n“If there’s an earthquake shaking that is sufficient to damage one of those fuel carts, Dunkirk will no longer exist and it will be wiped off from the face of the Earth,” Whittaker said.\n\nWhittaker estimated if shovels broke ground on Tuesday, it would take six years to complete the facility in Dunkirk.\n\n“We finally have a chance of something huge here folks and from a younger generation, many of us wanna see this happen,” one resident said.\n\nThere will be more meetings scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nDillon Morello is a reporter from Pittsburgh who has been part of theNews 4team since September of 2023. Seemore of his work hereandfollow him on Twitter.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Trump’s 50-day shift on Ukraine is a big deal — but probably not for Putin",
    "News_text":"New developments Tuesday reinforced the idea that President Donald Trump hassignificantly shiftedhis view of the Ukraine war.\n\nBut his short time horizons and lack of specificity on what exactly he will do for Ukraine, which are hallmarks of his leadership, mean the most critical factor preventing an end to the conflict will remain unchanged. There is little reason to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin will change his own calculations on a war he sees as a historic imperative and that may be existential for him politically.\n\nStill, some things have undeniably changed.\n\nWorst-case scenarios for what the first six months of Trump’s second term could mean for Ukraine didn’t come to pass.\n\nThis assessment excludes the Ukrainian civilians killed in Russia’s recent deadly escalation of drones and missile strikes, including on apartment blocks.\n\nButTrump hasn’t foldedto his erstwhile friend Putin. He’s not left Europe in the lurch under the shadow of an increasingly expansionist Russia amid the continent’s worst land war since World War II. Trump seems more warmly disposed toward NATO than he has been for years.\n\nUkraine faces the possibility of losing territory to a Russian summer offensive and more horror that civilians must bear. But diplomatically, it’s in a more favorable position with the Trump administration than anyone could have dared hope when President Volodymyr Zelensky got an Oval Office dressing-down in February. That means its hopes of surviving as an independent, sovereign state have improved.\n\nTrump’s hostility toward Kyiv and misgivings about pumping US aid into a World War I-style quagmire might mostly be motivated by his dismay that Putin snubbed his peace plans, which were slanted toward the Kremlin.\n\nBut he at least has now shed some misconceptions that by force of personality alone he can bend Putin to his will. And by promising Patriot missiles to Kyiv — which Trump said on Tuesday are “already being shipped” — and being open to a new Russia sanctions push in Congress, he’s added steel to American peacemaking.\n\nTrying to coerce Putin to the table may not work either. But at least Trump isn’t giving Ukraine away.\n\nTrump’s shift will allow all sides to recalibrate to new realities. Although,as CNN’s Matthew Chance pointed out, Trump’s 50-day deadline for Moscow to talk peace offers a seven-week window for the cynics in Moscow to lock in as many gains as possible by raining fire and death on Ukraine.\n\nStill, Trump has given himself some time to decide where he wants to go on Ukraine. And NATO states can enhance their own utility to Trump following a successful alliance summit.\n\nZelensky can try to build more goodwill with Trump to shape his approach to any future peace deals — though his experience in the Oval Office is a warning not to try to push the president too far.\n\nAnd while the caveats about Putin being willing to wage indefinite war still apply, there’s a small chance a few more weeks will persuade Putin to contemplate a US off-ramp to a deal likely to hand him territory he’s seized in the three-year war and that he could spin as a win for Russian pride and security as well as a rebuke to the West.\n\nTrump appeared optimistic Tuesday as he defended the ultimatum’s timeline. “A lot of opinions change very rapidly — might not be 50 days, might be much sooner than 50 days,” the president said.\n\nIt would be unwise to assume Trump’s estrangement with Putin is permanent.\n\nHis anger seems mostly born of disappointment that Putin has not delivered him a win with a peace deal that might yield a Nobel Prize rather than any deep sentimental or geopolitical concern for the implications of abandoning Ukraine.\n\nAnd, as usual, the president has tempered previous vehement criticism of the Russian leader. After slamming Putin’s “bullsh*t” last week, Trump on Monday told the BBC: “I’m not done with him.”\n\nTrump is transactional, operates in short windows of time and constantly seeks to land minor wins he can highlight. So, if he turned around and said he was meeting Putin in a summit next month or got mad at a new perceived slight from Zelensky, no one would be surprised.\n\n“My concern here is that Donald Trump has the ability to be swayed very quickly,” said Sabrina Singh, a former Pentagon deputy press secretary who is now a CNN global affairs commentator.\n\n“I fear that it’s only a matter of time until there’s another call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin where Putin gives some sort of concessions and says we’ll give a temporary five-day ceasefire and then turns around and says well, ‘Ukraine violated this ceasefire so we’re going to continue on with our war,’” Singh said on CNN News Central.\n\nStill, Trump’s change of position is significant.\n\nBy following through on his vow to send “top of the line weapons” to Ukraine quickly, he is taking a big step.Patriot anti-missile defense systems could save many civilian lives, but Trump is embracing a political risk in ditching campaign-trail skepticism toward Ukraineshared by many MAGA supporters.\n\nTrump has also shown more openness to sanctions. Trade between the US and Russia is minuscule at this point, so bilateral punishments won’t mean much. But if Trump does make good on a threat to impose secondary sanctions on nations that buy Russian products,especially energy exports, he could choke Moscow’s economy and war machine.\n\nStill, would he really target India and China — two leading purchasers of Russian goods, in a move that could severely disrupt US relations with those giant powers and throw the global economy into turmoil? His erratic history of imposing and then suspending tariffs as part of his global trade war suggests not. Moscow may be banking on it.\n\nIt also matters what, if any, additional weapons Trump may send to Ukraine. Its most optimistic supporters were delighted on Tuesday when the Financial Times first reported that the president had asked Zelensky in a phone call about Kyiv’s capacity to target both Moscow and St. Petersburg. But Trumptoned down the speculationon Tuesday, although aides told CNN that he has not ruled out shipping certain categories of offensive weapons to Ukraine that he’s so far been unwilling to provide.\n\n“No, he shouldn’t target Moscow,” Trump told reporters, referring to Zelensky. “I’m on nobody’s side. You know whose side I’m on? Humanity’s side.”\n\nThough he’d likely not admit it, the president is in a similar spot to one long occupied by his predecessor President Joe Biden. He’s considering how far he can push Putin while avoiding inflammatory steps that might cross his invisible red lines and widen the war.\n\nTrump’s new tolerance and even appreciation for NATO follows genuine fears that his new term might trigger the political earthquake of a US withdrawal.\n\nCredit goes to quiet diplomacy by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, who’ve worked on Trump and counseled Zelensky on how to approach the US in recent months.\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, meanwhile, choreographed an alliance summit in the Netherlands last month that delivered a political triumph for the president. An agreement that NATO states would spend 5% of GDP on defense by 2035 allowed Trump to argue he’d forced Europe to get serious about protecting itself and alleviating the burden on the US.\n\nAlongside Rutte in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump praised Europe’s spirit for the war in Ukraine, adding, “Ultimately, having a strong Europe is a very good thing — it’s a very good thing.”\n\nNow, NATO has solved another political problem for the president. It’s effectively being used as a front for him to send Patriot missiles to Kyiv. European nations are sending the batteries to Kyiv, after which US NATO allies will buy replacements from the US.\n\nRutte portrayed this diplomatic ballet as another win for Trump.\n\n“Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big, this is really big,” Rutte said, using characteristic praise that comes across as sycophancy to many but that Trump takes at face value. “You called me on Thursday, that you had taken a decision, and a decision is that you want Ukraine (to have) what it needs to have to maintain — to be able to defend itself against Russia — but you do want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical,” Rutte said.\n\nThe NATO conduit offers at least symbolic distance for Trump as he sends weapons to Ukraine for use in a war against Russia. It allows some level of plausible deniability if MAGA activists disapprove. And it satisfies Trump’s obsession with driving a good financial deal. Expect to hear him argue he’s secured new sales and even jobs for US defense workers.\n\nThe promise that other offensive weapons could also get to Ukraine using the same route is unspecific, however. It’s not clear whether Ukraine will get weapons that will enable it to make battlefield advances against Russia. And it’s unlikely that any US assistance will mirror the vast packages of military assistance and aid that were approved by Congress in the Biden administration.\n\nThe atmosphere on Capitol Hill is also changing. A drive to sanction Russia more severely already had strong bipartisan support in the Senate, and Trump has shown he can muster majorities in the House for his priorities.\n\nTrump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham and his Democratic co-sponsor Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Monday that their bill could be a “real executive hammer” to isolate Russia. But the measure could still stir dissent in the GOP base at a time when Trump is already upsetting some supporters over theJeffrey Epstein case.\n\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who opposes more aid to Ukraine, said Tuesday he doesn’t see an urgent need for a bill now that Trump has threatened to impose sanctions on Russia and even secondary punishments on India and China.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul blasted the initiative as “one of the most dangerous bills ever to come before the Senate.” He predicted a total cut-off of trade with China, India and Turkey if they were to be hit by US punishments.\n\nSo the domestic politics of Trump’s Ukraine shift are not yet fully settled.\n\nAnd neither, really, is the geopolitical situation.\n\nTrump has adopted a tougher policy toward Putin, but it’s not definitive or guaranteed to last. The extent of future US military support for Ukraine remains unclear, even if Kyiv’s government is in better standing with the president than ever before. And European NATO states can breathe a sigh of relief about Trump, but his trade war threats have caused a deep transatlantic rift.\n\nAll of this means that Putin’s key calculation all along — that he can outlast the West on the war in Ukraine — seems unlikely to significantly shift.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"NATO’s New Strategic Conscience",
    "News_text":"THE SHAPE OF NATO IS CHANGING. As the United States withdraws from the leadership position it has held since the foundation of the alliance, other countries are stepping up. Uncertain of the American nuclear umbrella, France and the United Kingdom arehinting at extending their own. Policy toward the alliance’s most important zones—the east and the far north—is beingdriven by the Nordic-Baltic Eight. And after visiting Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania last week, it’s become clear to me that not only the Baltic governments but the Baltic peoples are emerging as new political leaders of the world’s most successful military alliance.\n\nLast month, the governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania issued a joint declaration: In the event of an emergency—the implication being a Russian attack—all three nations will protect and relocate civilians, including across the three countries’ shared borders. “It was jointly agreed that national security is determined not only by military capabilities but also by the readiness of internal security systems, and their ability to maintain stability, anticipate, respond to, and withstand various crises,”saidthe Latvian Interior Ministry in a press release. The Baltics’ announcement signals a dramatic evolution from individual national planning to collective, synchronized action—a recognition that survival in today’s Europe requires more than independence. It requiresinterdependence.\n\nWhile the 2025 NATO Summit was consumed by political theater—especially the effort to accommodate President Trump’s skepticism of NATO obligations—just a few miles away, the International Criminal Courtissued arrest warrantsfor former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Gen. Valeriy Gerasimov for deliberately attacking civilian targets in Ukraine. For the Baltic states, the implications are unmistakable: If Russia could commit those crimes against the citizens of Ukraine, it could do the same to them. And if NATO’s unity wavers, and deterrence fails, then they’re prepared to fight.\n\nMaking the world a better place starts with average people making small decisions. That’s true in the Baltics, and it’s true in the United States, where you cantry outBulwark+free for one month.\n\nBut the Baltics aren’t acting alone. Not only are they cooperating more deeply and more actively in their common defense, but they are supported by other NATO allies who are committed to defending them even if the alliance as a whole comes up short. In Estonia, the United Kingdom leads a battlegroup supported by French, Danish, and Icelandic forces. In Latvia, a Canadian-led force trains alongside personnel from Italy, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. In Lithuania, Dutch, Norwegian, and Belgian forces reinforce a full German brigade which, in a long-awaited move, Berlin has now committed to permanently forward-stationing there.\n\nThese NATO forces are likely not enough to defeat the kind of invasion Ukraine faced in 2022, but for now, they don’t have to be. And it would be a mistake to dismiss them as purely symbolic. They live, train, and integrate with their host nation forces. They develop terrain familiarity and rehearse mobilization timelines. As European NATO members—especially the Nordic-Baltic Eight and Poland—ramp up their defense establishments, combined deployments like these help forces prepare to fight in the future.\n\nShare\n\nBUT WHAT IMPRESSED ME MOST while visiting each Baltic state wasn’t that their governments are clear-eyed and proactive, but that the ordinary citizens were, too. In a variety of ways, but with uniform clarity and consistency, I was assured that the Balts will defend their independence; that they harbor no illusions about the threats to their country in the short term and the long term; and that they are not merely reacting to danger, but preparing for it—together.\n\nIn Estonia, the Kaitseliit (Defense League) volunteer paramilitary force stands as a backbone of national readiness. In Latvia, the Zemessardze (National Guard) blends civilian life with military responsibility. And in Lithuania, the Šaulių Sąjunga (Riflemen’s Union) includes 16,000 volunteers ready to respond in defense of their homeland. These organizations are not ceremonial. They are integral to the nation’s defense, just like the Territorial Defense Forces in Ukraine. They train regularly. They mobilize quickly. And they exist as living reminders that, in the Baltics, defense starts in every backyard.\n\nWhen I served as commander of U.S. Army Europe, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were still early in their transformation from Soviet-structured defense systems to Western-style professional militaries. As we trained, exercised, and built trust together, their seriousness about defense was clear.\n\nJoin now\n\nBefore this month, I hadn’t visited the Baltics in more than a decade. What I saw and heard on my recent trip confirmed a shift that, like an earthquake, had been building for years: The Baltic states are no longer on the periphery of NATO. They are part of its new core. They are now NATO’s strategic conscience—small democracies preparing for the worst. With Russian oppression still a living memory, the Baltic governments are leading because the Baltic people are serious about their defense.\n\nAs I left my last stop in the Baltics, I reflected not just on the terrain and strategy, but on the people. These are nations that remember tyranny because their fathers and grandfathers lived it and fought against it. Their citizens have no illusions and are not divided about Russia’s intentions. And yet, their response is not panic—it is preparation. Quiet, determined, and unified.\n\nWe in the United States—and across the broader alliance—would do well to study the Baltics. If American leadership in NATO is waning (and it shouldn’t), I hope we reconsider and instead emulate the strategic vision and courage of those in the Baltics.\n\nShare The Bulwark",

    "News_title":"Case of 'El Chapo' son cooperating with U.S. prosecutors roils Mexico",
    "News_text":"A bitter public dispute between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the New York lawyer representing a son of drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has raised speculation here that the deal-seeking scion of the onetime Sinaloa cartel leader may expose corrupt Mexican officials.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sheinbaum said she had filed a defamation complaint in Mexico againstJeffrey Lichtman, the high-profile attorney representing Ovidio Guzmán López, who last weekpleaded guiltyin federal court in Chicago to fentanyl trafficking and other crimes. He has agreed to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in a bid to reduce a potential life sentence.\n\nIn comments after the court hearing, Lichtman labeled as “absurd” Sheinbaum’s repeated contentions that Washington should coordinate with Mexico on the case — especially if, as is widely expected, Guzmán López spills the beans on alleged ties between Mexican officials and cartels.\n\nIn an incendiary post on X, Litchman assailed the Mexican leader’s “corrupt office and government” and charged that Sheinbaum “acts more as the public relations arm of a drug trafficking organization than as the honest leader that the Mexican people deserve.”\n\nRead more:How 'El Diablo,' a corrupt Mexican lawman, helped create a narco-state\n\nThat sparked a flurry of denunciations from allies in Sheinbaum’s ruling Morena bloc, which dominates Mexican politics.\n\nErnestina Godoy Ramos, Sheinbaum’s official counsel, labeled Lichtman’s comments “grotesque and unforgivable, breaking the ethical and legal limits of the profession.”\n\nDeclared Sheinbaum: “I’m not going to establish a dialogue with a lawyer for [a] narco-trafficker.”\n\nLichtman also represented El Chapo — now serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison in Colorado — and is the attorney for Joaquín Guzmán López, another son of the drug lord. Like his brother, he is in U.S. custody and faces drug smuggling and other charges.\n\nRead more:What's it like to defend a Mexican cartel boss? Reputed drug lords seek lawyers in U.S.\n\nEl Chapo’s sons, known asLos Chapitos, or the \"Little Chapos,\" assumed responsibility for cartel dealings after their father’s arrest in 2016, prosecutors say. Guzmán López wasextradited to the United Statesin 2023 after being nabbed following a shootout outside Culiacán, the Sinaloa state capital, that left almost two dozen people dead, including 10 Mexican soldiers. Two other sons of El Chapo remain in Mexico directing cartel operations, according to U.S. officials.\n\nBehind the nasty contretemps between the New York barrister andla presidentais a widespread sense here that Guzmán López is poised to dish a mound of dirt about Mexican politicians on the payroll of the Sinaloa cartel. He may have already done so.\n\nWhat else, political observers ask, could explain the special treatment that members of El Chapo's family received in the spring?\n\nIn May, U.S. authorities escorted17 membersof El Chapo's extended family — including his ex-wife, the mother of Ovidio and Joaquín — into San Diego from Tijuana. Although the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment, Mexico's top law enforcement official said the move was probably part of a cooperation deal between Guzmán López and Washington.\n\n“He [Ovidio] must be singing,” said Guillermo Valdés Castellanos, a former intelligence chief in the administration of former President Felipe Calderón, a political adversary of Sheinbaum. “I think it’s part of a very clear strategy by the government of Donald Trump to pressure Mexico … to take action against the profound links between organized crime and and Mexican politics.”\n\nWhile frequently praising Sheinbaum, Trump has denounced the “intolerable alliance” between Mexico’s government and organized crime. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs on Mexico in what he calls an effort to shut down fentanyl trafficking.\n\nThough critics have called Trump's characterizations overblown, the narco-government collaboration in Mexico goes back decades.\n\nCalderón's top security official, Genaro García Luna, was convicted of takingmillions of dollars in bribesfrom Sinaloa cartel traffickers and is serving a 38-year U.S. prison sentence.\n\nSheinbaum and her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, hailed the U.S. prosecution of García Luna — a case that exposed deep corruption among their political rivals. But the tables may now be turning.\n\nThere have been no public disclosures about what Guzmán López may be secretly revealing to U.S. prosecutors. But speculation in Mexico has focused on the suspected crookedness of so-called narco-governors serving under the banner of Sheinbaum's dominant Morena political bloc. None have been charged.\n\nRead more:17 members of a cartel kingpin's family were escorted into California from Mexico. Why?\n\nBut even more explosive, experts say, would be any fresh allegations against López Obrador, Sheinbaum's predecessor and the founder of Morena. During his six-year term, López Obrador repeatedly denied unconfirmed reports of having received political donations from people tied to organized crime.\n\nBy all accounts, any public airing of new accusations against López Obrador from U.S. authorities could trigger a political earthquake in Mexico.\n\n\"There is total uncertainty and fear in the presidency,\" said José Luis Montenegro, a Mexican journalist who wrote a book onLos Chapitos. \"The politicians of Morena must be trembling.\"\n\nSheinbaum has won widespread acclaim for her “coolheaded” approach to Trump provocations on issues such as tariffs, immigration and drug smuggling. But the Mexican president has sharply rebuked U.S. prosecutors’ apparent deal-making intentions with El Chapo’s son. She has accused U.S. authorities of hypocrisy — seeking cooperation from Guzmán López at a time when the Trump administration has designated the Sinaloa cartel and other Mexican crime groups as terrorist organizations.\n\n\"So where is their position of 'not to negotiate with terrorist groups'?\" Sheinbaum asked this month.\n\nMexican leaders are still outraged about what they call the U.S.-orchestrated kidnapping almost a year ago ofIsmael \"El Mayo\" Zambada— co-founder of El Chapo's Sinaloa cartel — who is now also in custody in the United States.\n\nMexican officials suspect that U.S. authorities recruited Joaquín Guzmán López to abduct El Mayo, bundle him into a private plane and fly him to an airfield outside El Paso, where U.S. agents arrested both El Mayo and Joaquín Guzmán López.\n\nWashington has never clarified its role in the sensational case. The apparent betrayal of El Mayo set off a civil war in the cartel — pitting El Mayo loyalists againstLos Chapitos— that has cost hundreds of lives in Sinaloa state.\n\nNow, three top accused Sinaloa cartel capos sit in U.S. custody, and at least one, Guzmán López, appears keen to make a deal that could expose a web of official corruption, roiling Mexican politics.\n\nSpecial correspodent Cecilia Sánchez Vidal contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

    "News_text":"The Senate voted early Thursday to claw back $9 billion in federal funding for global aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, sending the package requested by President Trump to the House for a final vote.\n\nThe 51-48 vote on what’s known as a rescissions package is a victory for Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of the federal government, and who has come under fire from Democrats for adding a projected $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade by signing his One Big, Beautiful Bill Act into law earlier this month.\n\nSenators finally passed the package after 2 a.m. Thursday after voting for more than 12 hours on amendments.\n\nThe win is more symbolic than anything, as it would cut only one tenth of 1 percent from the federal budget.\n\nEven so, Republicans see it as important progress.\n\n“It’s a small but important step toward fiscal sanity that we all should be able to agree is long overdue,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) said before the final vote.\n\nTrump failed to get a $15 billion rescissions package passed during his first term after Senate Republicans balked at the proposal.\n\nThis time around, Trump is working with a bigger Senate Republican majority and a GOP conference that is generally more amenable to his agenda than it was seven years ago.\n\nThune was able to get Trump’s latest rescissions bill over the finish line even though two senior Republicans on the Appropriations Committee voted “no.”\n\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the chair of the Interior Appropriations subcommittees, opposed the package.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the chair of the Defense Appropriation subcommittee,voted “no” on two procedural votesTuesday night but voted in favor of final passage.\n\nDemocrats were missing Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), who was hospitalized after feeling unwell.\n\nCollins on several occasions before the final vote raised concerns about what she saw as the White House’s failure to offer sufficient details about how the funding rescissions would be implemented. She raised that issue directly with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought at a lunch meeting Tuesday.\n\nSenate Republican leaders lined up the votes after the White House agreed to an amendment toremove from the package the $400 million in cutsto the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) global anti-AIDS initiative launched by former President George W. Bush more than 20 years ago.\n\nThune told reporters Tuesday that saving PEPFAR from deep cuts was a top priority of many GOP senators.\n\nThe bill would still cut nearly $8 billion from an assortment of international programs, including development assistance, the economic support fund, the United States Agency for International Development global health programs and programs to assist refugees and victims of international disasters.\n\nIt would cut more than $1 billion dollars from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which would hit rural radio stations that depend more on federal funding than their big-city counterparts.\n\nRepublicans hailed the cuts to public broadcasting, something Trump proposed during his first term but failed to achieve, as a big victory.\n\n“I hope that the administration keeps sending us rescissions packages. That’s the only way I can see us reducing spending,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said.\n\n“The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, we’re going to cut them off like a dead stump,” he said, pointing to National Public Radio CEO Katherine Maher’s social media post from 2020 declaring “America is addicted to white supremacy.”\n\nBut some Republicans, including Murkowski, expressed concern that defunding public broadcasting would hurt radio stations that are often the only sources of information during natural disasters in her home state.\n\nShe pointed out Wednesday that a powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake in the Aleutian Islands has forced communities along a 700-mile stretch of Alaska’s coastline to evacuate, and many of those residents rely on public radio for news.\n\n“Seven-point-three [magnitude] earthquake off of Alaska and tsunami warnings. You know how I got this information? From public broadcasting,” she said.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) saidat the Hill Nation Summit on Wednesdaythat the cuts could put rural radio stations in her home state out of business.\n\n“These rural stations are often the lifeblood of these communities when it comes to emergency alerts,” she said.\n\n“These are things that, they sound small, but they are what bring communities together,” she added.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the legislation would have “devastating consequences.”\n\n“This bill will harm America’s farmers and researchers and businesses, make the world an easier place, unfortunately, for terrorist recruitment, and reward communist China and [Russian President] Vladimir Putin,” Schumer said of the cuts to global aid programs.\n\n“Republicans are rushing forward without a clue how these unhinged cuts will be implemented,” he declared.\n\nDemocrats tried and failed to amend the legislation to spare various federal programs from cuts.\n\nAn amendment sponsored by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) to shield $496 million for international disaster relief failed by a vote of 49-50, although Collins, Murkowski and McConnell voted for it.\n\nAnd a motion sponsored by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) to recommit the bill back to the Appropriations Committee with instructions to restore Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding failed by a vote of 48-51.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) offered an amendment to strike the rescission of $785 million appropriated for the Feed the Future Initiative, a global hunger and food security program, praising the program for helping to “save lives, promote self-reliance” and create new opportunities for trade. It failed by a vote of 48-51.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) offered a substitute amendment that had been contemplated by Collins to reduce the cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and global health programs. It would have also protected NATO dues and funding to Ukraine.\n\nKelly offered Collins’s amendment after the Maine senator decided it didn’t have a chance of being adopted by the House.\n\nRepublicans voted to table the amendment, 51-47.\n\nSchumer warned in a “Dear Colleague” letter last month that the Republican push to rescind funding that Congress had agreed to on a bipartisan basis in the pastcould threaten the chancesof reaching any spending deals later this year.\n\nHe said Republican senators know it’s “absurd” to expect Democrats “to act as business as usual and engage in a bipartisan appropriations process to fund the government while they concurrently plot to pass a purely partisan rescissions bill.”\n\nThe legislation now heads to the House, where lawmakers must pass it by Friday or otherwise the Office of Management and Budget will be forced to release its hold on the funding it has targeted for rescission.\n\nThune, speaking to reporters Tuesday, described the amended language to restore the funding for the Bush-era anti-AIDS initiative as a “small modification” and expressed hope the House would accept the Senate’s work.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

(Photo courtesy of the office of U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst)\n\nU.S. Sen. Joni Ernst praised the cuts to U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) included in the bill passed in the early hours of Thursday to cancel $9 billion in federal funding for foreign aid efforts and public broadcasting.\n\nErnst spoke in support of the cuts made through the rescissions bill, requested by President Donald Trump’s administration, that will claw back federal funding that had previously been approved, some of which were provisions targeted by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) service earlier in 2025.\n\nThe Iowa Republican has regularly criticized USAID spending and supported the DOGE cuts and theclosure of the foreign aid agency.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor, Ernst, who leads the DOGE Caucus, said the cuts were eliminating wasteful spending going to programs which she said should not have received money from the U.S. government through USAID, including $20 million in funding approvedto produce a Sesame Street programfor Iraq and $2 million for promoting tourism in Lebanon.\n\nShe also highlighted that USAID provided more than $800,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, a locationtheorized by some to be the origin of COVID-19.\n\n“What exactly was our international development agency developing at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology?” Ernst said. “Well, if the CIA, FBI, and other experts are correct that the COVID virus likely originated from a lab leak, USAID may have had a hand in a once-in-a-century pandemic that claimed the lives of millions.”\n\nErnst said there is “shortage of other questionable USAID projects, but President Trump is putting an end to this deep state operation.”\n\n“The foreign assistance programs that do advance American interests are now being administered under the watchful eye of Secretary Marco Rubio,” Ernst said. “… Overseas projects without merit are being ended and the tax dollars that were paying for them will be refunded if the Senate passes the rescissions bill.”\n\nIn addition to her comments on USAID, Ernst also said she supported canceling $1.1 billion in taxpayer support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the bill would have gone toward NPR, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and hundreds of local news stations throughout the country in the next two fiscal years. Ernst said often, programming from these outlets are “partisan propaganda.”\n\n“NPR and PBS have a right to say whatever the heck they want, but they don’t have a right to force hardworking Americans to pay for their political propaganda being masked as a public service,” Ernst said.\n\nAll Senate Democrats who voted opposed the measure, and were joined by Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski said she opposed the cuts to federal funding for public broadcast because of the importance of these services for Alaska when facing natural disasters, pointinginformation shared about a potential tsunami by a local stationfollowing a 7.3 magnitude earthquake Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats also proposed amendments to change the provisions related to foreign aid — particularly for efforts related to global health and disaster relief — as well as for public broadcasting. These amendments were not adopted.\n\n“Think about what we are doing, think about the example we are setting,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, said while speaking on a proposed amendment striking the cut of $496 million ininternational disaster assistance.\n\nErnst and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley voted in support of the legislation in the early morning Thursday, getting it passed the Senate in the51-48 votethat largely fell along party lines.

    "News_title":"Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state. Here is why Wednesday's earthquake was notable",
    "News_text":"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Wednesday’s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years — including one that shook communitiesalmost exactly two years earlier.\n\nOfficials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage fromthe latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska’s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.\n\nEarthquake sparked tsunami warnings\n\nThe earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.\n\nThere are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio orpublic radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.\n\nPublic safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.\n\nThe warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.\n\nAlaska is one of world's most seismically active regions\n\nAlaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake — and the tsunami it triggered — killed about 130 people.\n\nThe Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has “lit up” since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifthexceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.\n\n“I would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: “There's no reason to be alarmist about this.”\n\nPeople should continue to heed warnings, officials say\n\nSome communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.\n\n“That area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,” he said.\n\nSometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. “If it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you’re in a coastal area,” he said.\n\nZidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a “burnout effect” among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.\n\nWest said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 — west of the location of Wednesday's quake — that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n“This area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,” he said.",

    "News_title":"The GOP Just Did Something That’s Going to Hit Its Voters the Hardest",
    "News_text":"Sign up for the Slatestto get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIn November 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson added a monumental new institution to his Great Society: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a “miracle in communication” that LBJ compared to the United States’ first telegraph line. “This Corporation will assist stations and producers who aim for the best in broadcasting good music, in broadcasting exciting plays, and in broadcasting reports on the whole fascinating range of human activity,” Johnson remarked, as he approved the nonprofit that wouldbirth National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. “Today we rededicate a part of the airwaves—which belong to all the people—and we dedicate them for the enlightenment of all the people.”\n\nNearly 60 years later, Congress has done all it can to obliterate that mission. This week, the Senate narrowly approved a legislative package thatrescinds $9 billion in formerly approved spendingfor various federal programs—including but not limited to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. About $1.1 billion of that money had been directed to support CPB over the next two years. The corporation would then have delegated the bulk of it to its over 1,500 affiliate radio and TV stations—many of which are theonlyfree sources of basic information available to millions of Americans in rural regions as well as underfunded communities like Native reservations. These primary sources of news, emergency alerts, educational programming, arts coverage, and stories fromyourneighborhood are to be severely curtailed.\n\nThis rescissions package, thefirst of its kindin 30 years, is not yet law; the House of Representativeswill vote Thursdaybefore the bill goes to President Donald Trump’s desk. But it’s unlikely the House will preserve public media funding either. [Update, July 18, 2025, at 9:50 a.m.: The Housevoted to pass the packagearound midnight.] Historically, Republicans from states with significant rural and Indigenous populations have often fought to preserve and even expand public media funds, even when other GOP legislators opposed such efforts. (Past recipients of the Champion of Public Broadcasting Award include reliable conservatives such asWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito,Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, andOklahoma Rep. Tom Cole.) Polls conducted over the years have consistentlydemonstrated major support for public mediaandits government fundsfromthe populace—includingGOP voters. Trump, during his first term,consistentlyattemptedto zero out public media budgets, yetwas often stymiedby fellow Republicans.\n\nThis time, Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were the only real GOP holdouts, with the latter pointing to aWednesday earthquakein her home state of Alaska as an example of public media’s necessity. “Local residents and summer visitors alike were able to evacuate thanks to federal tsunami advisories relayed through local public broadcasting stations,” Murkowskitweeted that day, echoing a speech she made on the Senate floor. “Their response to today’s earthquake is a perfect example of the incredible public service these stations provide.”\n\nWhat changed for their colleagues, then? There are two main factors here: a yearslong culture-war campaign toreduce Americans’ trustin NPR and PBS, and the far-right Heritage Foundation’s successful effort to install the architects of itsProject 2025 agendain the White House. After a former NPR senior editor published a screed last yearaccusing his employerof having been compromised by “wokeness,” right-wing activists leaped on the controversy to undermine the radio network’s then recently installed CEO, Katherine Maher, by pointing out her past anti-Trump and pro-Biden tweets. The attacks on Maher extended to her affiliations with other nonprofit services likeWikimediaandSignal, and she was called up totestify to Congressthis March alongside PBS CEO Paula Kerger.\n\nBut it was less a hearing than amoment of Republican bellyaching, having been organized bywell-known conspiracistMarjorie Taylor Greene, given the title of “Anti-American Airwaves,” and rounded out with a Heritage Foundation fellow as a witness. The ridiculous sideshow saw Republicansfalsely claim thatPBS had introduced drag shows into children’s programming and transformed themselves into propaganda machines. This served as an addition to Project 2025 co-author and Federal Communications Commission ChairmanBrendan Carr’s ongoing crusade, in which he baselessly accused PBS and NPR of “violating federal law by airing commercials,” something public broadcasters are prohibited from doing. And that was all on top of Trump’s endeavors tofire three CPB board memberswho had been appointed by President Joe Biden.\n\nThis was nothing like the forum where Fred Rogers broughta PBS-skeptical lawmaker to tearswith an impassioned case for the value of public programming. Rather, it was the cheap justification for widespread cuts to “far left” public media proposed by DOGE and by Russell Vought, the Project 2025 leader now serving as Trump’s Office of Management and Budget director. Late last month, pro–public media senators grilled Vought in a less sensational hearing about how slashed CPB funding would starve rural neighborhoods of a much-needed public resource. He excused the move by vaguely promising that emergency services and rural stations would be fine no matter what, while adding that the budget cuts wouldn’t take effect until the next fiscal year, giving CPB member stations “ample time to adjust.”\n\nThat’s not quite the case. NPR and PBS are well prepped to adjust, as national brands that use a only minimal amount of their federal dollars—2 percent of NPR’s budgetand15 percent of PBS’s budget, respectively—and earn ample revenue from corporate sponsorships, viewer donations, distribution fees, and special endowment. However, even though CPB gives the bulk of its government appropriations to local stations, it does get some money in turn—namely, programming fees that Michigan Public pays for the rights to broadcast NPR shows likeAll Things Considered, just as Missouri’s Ozarks Public Television pays for the rights to broadcastPBS NewsHour. Local public radio and TV stations don’t have the same wider recognition that NPR and PBS do, and if they serve low-income areas (as many of them do), their listeners are less able to gift substantial donations. Overall, NPR and PBS will take a hit, but they have a much better chance of adapting than Alaska Public Media does. Which means such stations are likely to trim costs further, lay off staffers, or even close altogether.\n\nIt’s obviously true that radio and TVare no longerthe dynamic, widely indispensable media they were in the preinternet age. Butcardriversandlong-haul truckersstill love their NPR, and rural areaswithout high-speed internetcan still depend on public airwaves. Plus, CPB has done a valiant job of adjusting to the digital age, bringingmore PBS shows to streaming, on its own app and on other services (see also:Sesame Street), while NPR still producessome of the most successful podcastsof the modern age. PBS hasnoted in its own statsthat nearly 60 percent of American television households—about 130 million people—tune in to local and national public stations on a yearly basis, and that 60 percent of those viewers hail from rural areas. The TV network’s kids’ programming in particular remainsthe gold standardin terms of healthy and legitimately educational screen time for millions of children in the U.S. At the very least, it’s a more than worthy substitute forYouTube brainrot.\n\nAlso, for pundits and members of Congress to decry CPB as some leftist indoctrination factory is laughable. The corporation has multiple Republican board members, including current President and CEO Patricia Harrison, a George W. Bush appointee. Throughout their lifespans, NPR and PBS—along with their member stations—have employed several conservative hosts, including William F. Buckley Jr., Milton Friedman, Rich Lowry, and Sarah Isgur. And all hosts frequently bring on right-wing voters, legislators, and commentators to share their views—including those politicians who directly inform radio and TV anchors why they want to halt federal support.\n\nAnd if I can get personal for a second: I don’t know what I would be today without NPR, PBS, and their locally tailored Michigan programming. Even as a youth of the computer age, I learned so much and found endless value inMister Rogers’ Neighborhoodreruns,classical-music broadcasts, and specialized podcasts likeMicrophone Check. Such free-to-consume treasures opened up my world and exposed me to ideas I would never have encountered otherwise.\n\nThis is not the end of public media, to be clear. At least three dozen states also providedirect monetary supportfor local public stations, and there are other nonprofit groups not backed by the federal government, like American Public Media and Pacifica. Still, the local and national media ecosystems will suffer a steep injury, and there will be a far narrower range of programming and opportunities than before. Lyndon Johnson’s dream of dedicating America’s channels to the enlightenment of the public has been shattered.",

    "News_title":"State lawmaker pushing for more transparency from insurance companies on earthquake coverage",
    "News_text":"SUMMERVILLE, S.C. (WCBD) — A recent earthquake in Summerville is putting renewed focus on one state lawmaker’s push to require greater transparency from insurance companies when it comes to coverage options.\n\nA 2.2 magnitude earthquake struck just southwest of Summerville just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, according to a report from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nSmall tremors are not an uncommon occurrence in South Carolina — an estimated 10 to 15 earthquakes happen each year — and about 70% of them are clustered in three areas: Ravenel-Adams Run-Hollywood, Middleton-Place-Summerville, and Bowman.\n\nBut predicting the exact time and place of an earthquake or aftershock is challenging, and seismologists widely agree that anywhere one has happened before, it can happen again.\n\nMost, however, are not felt or noticed by people. Still, experts note that even small shifts in the ground can put stress on a home’s foundation, potentially leading to damage over time.\n\nWhile coverage for earthquake-related damage is not included in most standard homeowners and rental insurance policies, adding it to a policy is relatively simple: just ask.\n\n“Consumers can purchase earthquake coverage as an endorsement to their existing homeowners’ policies or as a stand-alone policy,” said Michael Wise, the Director of the South Carolina Department of Insurance. “Since earthquakes can cause extensive structural damage, having this coverage ensures that you’re not left facing major expenses alone.”\n\nThe problem, according to one lawmaker, is that most people don’t know it is available at all.\n\n“I’m glad nobody was hurt, but it’s a good reminder that, you know, we aren’t often thinking about earthquake insurance,” State Rep. Gil Gatch (R-Summerville) told News 2 after Wednesday’s quake. “We just need people to know that it’s offered.”\n\nGatch introduced a bill in the South Carolina House in February 2021 that would require all insurance agencies operating in the state to inform homeowners about the risk of earthquakes and allow them to opt in or out of coverage.\n\nThe model would be similar to what already exists for underinsured motorist coverage, he said. That type of coverage is optional in the state, but insurance providers still have to verify that it has been offered to a customer.\n\n“I’m not demanding that insurance companies offer products that they don’t offer, but I think that if they offer it, they need to let their people know that we sit on the fault and this is an option that they have to purchase,” Gatch said. “If they don’t [want extra coverage], they can just sign a waiver that they don’t.”\n\nGatch’s bill, reintroduced each session, has yet to get a subcommittee hearing as other issues have taken precedence, but he said he is hopeful for one at the beginning of next year’s legislative session.\n\nA representative for the nonprofit South Carolina Insurance Association wrote in a statement to News 2 that while the pending legislation is “well-intended,” it could create complications in the industry.\n\n“The requirement of collecting and retaining signed declinations for every policy in force would create an unnecessary burden for the insured and the insurer,” the statement read, in part.\n\nWhat flood insurance does and does not cover\n\nIn the meantime, the Department of Insurance (DOI) encourages South Carolinians to consider getting extra coverage to protect themselves from “potentially devastating” impacts.\n\nThough no major earthquakes have hit the state recently, a 2001 study commissioned by the then-South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division found that many contemporary structures are vulnerable to earthquake activity.\n\nGatch said that not properly educating people about the risk and their options could deprive them of what may be important coverage.\n\nA separate study determined that an earthquake of similar intensity and location to the 7.0 magnitude one that struck the Charleston area in 1886 would cause more than $20 billion in damage and injure or kill thousands of people.\n\n“The citizens are going to be better served if they at least know that it’s available,” he said. “It’s only after a tragedy or catastrophic event that we say, ‘Well, I wish I would have known.’ This is an opportunity to make sure that people who are purchasing insurance on their homes and businesses know.”\n\nAnyone interested in learning more about earthquake coverage or who needs assistance purchasing it can contact DOI’s Office of Consumer Services at 803-737-6180 to be connected with an insurance agent in their area.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Lisa Murkowski voted against.\n\nSullivan spokesperson Amanda Coyne sent a statement by email on Thursday repeating the senator’s position that he had warned public media, NPR and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for years about their “biased reporting” that “would eventually jeopardize federal support for both national and local radio stations,” she said.\n\nHowever, Coyne added, Sullivan has advocated for rural stations and has been working with other senators and White House officials on alternative sources of funding to keep rural stations on the air, particularly Native stations in Alaska.\n\n“Currently, there is approximately $10 million available for tribal and Native stations in the country. Alaska has 11 Native stations. Going forward, Senator Sullivan will continue working to provide resources to support as many Alaska rural radio stations as possible. He was discussing this funding issue with a senior administration official this morning,” Coyne said.\n\nCoyne did not respond to questions on how much would be available for Alaska stations, when, or what stations would be eligible.\n\nMurkowski was outspoken and critical of the rescission bill, voting no.\n\nIn astatementon Thursday, she first cited a lack of clarity by the Trump administration for what programs and amounts would be rescinded, especially for global health programs. “We still lack necessary details, including which ones will be zeroed out. There is no way to determine the implications for lifesaving care and vital resources for women and children abroad,” she said.\n\n“I also strongly oppose the rescission of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. My colleagues are targeting NPR but will wind up hurting – and, over time, closing down – local radio stations that provide essential news, alerts, and educational programming in Alaska and across the country,” she said.\n\nMurkowski introduced an amendment on the Senate floor late Wednesday night to protect CPB funding, and it wasvoted down 51 to 47.\n\nMurkowski told reporters on Thursday afternoon in an audio recording shared with the Alaska Beacon, when asked about the fate of rural stations in Alaska, that her office was also looking into funding for stations from federal tribal grants.\n\n“Some of them, about a dozen, will be able to access these tribal grants,” she told the reporters.\n\n“But that’s less than half of the Alaska stations. So what happens to KUCB going forward?” she said, referring to the public radio station in Unalaska that broadcast a tsunami warning and emergency evacuation order for remote Aleutian Island communities followinga magnitude 7.3 earthquake the day before.\n\n“So what we’re trying to do is kind of identify how perilously close are many of these small stations to being in a shut down mode. How much do they have to carry them forward?” she said.\n\nIn her statement, Murkowski emphasized her opposition to the rescission process, driven by the White House Office of Management and Budget, as undermining Congress’ authority.\n\n“Finally, and most importantly, approving this package in this manner further shifts the balance of power over the federal budget to the executive branch. Congress, not OMB, holds the power of the purse under the Constitution. To the extent that certain appropriations are not necessary to comply with the laws passed by Congress, we can best address that through the annual budgeting process, where we routinely rescind funds every year.”\n\nThe rescission bill now advances back to the U.S. House, which passed an earlier version of the measure. As of Thursday evening it had not been taken up for a vote.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_title":"Public broadcasters say GOP funding cuts could be 'devastating' to local media and make Americans less safe",
    "News_text":"When amagnitude-7.3 earthquakestruck off southern Alaska on Wednesday, officials were concerned about a potential tsunami. It was local public media that helped relay a tsunami alert, Sen. Lisa Murkowski said.\n\nBut now, looming GOP-led funding cuts are concerning media allies that local public broadcasters would be forced to downsize or shutter, damaging news operations and hurting locals’ ability to get timely emergency alerts like the one issued in Alaska.\n\n\"Their response to today’s earthquake is a perfect example of the incredible public service these stations provide,\" Murkowski, of Alaska, one of two Republican senators to oppose the cuts,said Wednesday on X. \"They deliver local news, weather updates, and, yes, emergency alerts that save human lives.\"\n\nMore than 50 years after NPR and PBS first hit the airwaves, the two public broadcasters with hundreds of member stations face millions in budget cuts after Republican senators voted to claw back previously appropriated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which funds public media like NPR and PBS.\n\nTheHouse cleared the measureafter midnight Friday, sending it to President Donald Trump for his signature.\n\nRepublicans have framed the spending cuts bill as part of an effort to target purported \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government-funded programs. GOP lawmakers have accused NPR and PBS of having a liberal bias, and in March,Republicans claimedthat they were \"anti-American airwaves.\"\n\nBut media advocates argue that the cuts would have devastating effects on the American media landscape and an especially harmful impact on rural Americans, who may rely more heavily on local NPR and PBS stations for local news.\n\n\"I think unfortunately this is cutting off their constituents’ noses to spite NPR’s face,\" NPR CEO Katherine Maher said Wednesday on CNN. \"It doesn’t help anyone to take this funding away.”\n\nPBS President and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement after the vote that the cuts would “significantly” affect PBS stations, saying they “will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas.”\n\n“Many of our stations, which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts, will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,” she said.\n\nMore than 70% of the government funding appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting goes to the 1,500 public television and radio stations, according to the company. (In contrast, NPR says it gets about 1% of its annual funding from the government, though it also gets about a third through member stations, which are partly government-funded to varying degrees. PBS says it gets about 15% of its funds from the government.)\n\nPatricia Harrison, the president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement that eliminating funding for CPB would force many local stations to shut down.\n\n\"Millions of Americans will have less trustworthy information about their communities, states, country, and world with which to make decisions about the quality of their lives,\" she said.\n\nThe cuts would come as the number of local outlets in the United States continues steadily declining. A report last year byNorthwestern University's Medill Local News Initiativefound that newspapers were disappearing at a rate of more than two per week and that 3.5 million people live in counties with no local news outlets consistently producing content.\n\n\"This could be a death sentence for a number of local stations,\" said Tim Franklin, the initiative's director.\n\nNPR and PBS rely on a combination of federal sources, including the government and private donations. Media experts warned that local stations in more rural areas could bear the brunt of cuts.\n\nStations in rural areas \"are more reliant on the federal funding because there is a smaller population for them to raise additional funds from and there's less of a commercial incentive to be there,\" said Kate Riley, the president and CEO of the nonprofit America's Public Television Stations.\n\nSome stations are already downsizing in anticipation of funding cuts.\n\nShawn Turner, the general manager of WKAR Public Media in Michigan, said he has already had to lay off nine staffers in anticipation of federal cuts. About 16% of WKAR's budget comes from federal funding, he said.\n\nThe cuts, Turner said, would affect the newsroom's ability to devote resources to deep dives into issues like the impact of tariffs on Michigan's manufacturing industry.\n\n\"We've been able to ask them to begin to do a deep dive in really understanding how that's going to impact the community so that we have that reporting ready to go,\" Turner said. \"Our ability to do that going forward is going to be limited.\"\n\nLocal public broadcasters also play a key role in disseminating emergency alerts and timely updates during natural disasters, advocates say.\n\nThere are no viable alternatives in some communities, and locals cannot rely on social media for accurate updates, said Clayton Weimers, the executive director of Reporters Without Borders in the United States.\n\n\"Going online is not a viable alternative because it is such a cesspool of false information, and that cesspool gets even murkier in times of crisis,\" Weimers said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday shot down concerns over the impact of public media cuts on safety.\n\n\"I am not sure how NPR helps the public safety of our country, but I do know that NPR, unfortunately, has become really just a propaganda voice for the left,\" she said.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in May directing CPB to cut funding for NPR and PBS, framing them as \"biased media.\"\n\nMaher, NPR’s CEO, said Thursday that national programming makes up a quarter of programming of all stations, with the other 75% representing “local programming, local needs and other national programmers.”\n\n“We want to make sure that we’re available and relevant to the entire American public, regardless of where you sit and regardless of what your political beliefs are, and we’ve been taking the steps from an editorial standpoint to better understand what audience needs are and have more voices on air,” Maher said on NBC’s “Meet the Press NOW.”\n\nLocal station leaders are also pushing back against the administration, some of them arguing that it is interfering with a free and independent media.\n\n\"I think that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to be independent and free from political interference and that the U.S. government has no place meddling in the editorial decisions or punishing the editorial decisions of NPR and PBS,\" said Sage Smiley, the news director of Alaska public media station KYUK.\n\nTim Richardson, the program manager for journalism and disinformation at the free expression advocacy group PEN America, called the new GOP cuts punitive.\n\n“These cuts are not about fiscal responsibility. It’s once again about punishing independent journalism, independent outlets that don’t adhere to the administration’s narrative of events,\" he said. \"It’s a viewpoint discrimination with the end goal of, you know, undermining editorial, editorial independence.”\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields responded in a statement Thursday that “NPR and PBS will have to learn to survive on their own” without “taxpayer subsidies.”\n\nPublic media have faced threats from Republican presidents before,including during Trump's first term. Richard Nixon, for example, \"pounced on it almost immediately,\" said Victor Pickard, a media professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I think it’s fair to say that every Republican president, save for perhaps Gerald Ford, has had somewhat of an adversarial position towards public broadcasting,\" Pickard said.\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_title":"The God Squad: Remembering Isaiah 45:7 and the Texas floods",
    "News_text":"One of the strongest proofs for the divine nature of the Bible is the way we turn to it in times of catastrophe. Unfortunately, one of the strongest refutations of the belief in a good and all-powerful God is the obvious fact that God allowed the catastrophe to occur.\n\nThe dilemma of evil in a world with a good, powerful God was eloquently penned in the play “J.B.” by the American playwright and poet Archibald MacLeish: “If God is great, he is not good. If God is good, he is not God. Take the even, take the odd.”\n\nThis is the searing choice we face after the Texas floods. The death of more than 100 innocent people and most tragically the death of 27 children at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp, has presented every God-believing person with the choice between a benevolent but impotent God or a powerful but uncaring God. Neither choice offers solace or preserves faith.\n\nLet us explode these false choices by considering the two kinds of evil we face here on planet earth and why a powerful, good God fits perfectly into our struggles to make sense of the sudden death of the innocent among us.\n\nThe first kind of evil is moral evil. Moral evils are caused by us, and they are not God’s fault. When we choose a path of sin and cruelty, of selfishness and anger, we are to blame, not God. God has set before us a path of life and because of our moral frailties we often avoid that choice.\n\nThe second type of evil is natural evil. These are natural disasters that take life for those in the path of nature’s wrath. They are not caused by us but we suffer because of them. The only cause is God who made the natural world that explodes upon us without predictable cause. Is it not fair to lay the blame of the Texas floods upon God as another example of natural evil?\n\nNo.\n\nIn fact, natural evil is not evil at all. Natural evil is just the normal working out of the natural world. If there was no camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, there would just have been a big rush of water and a few thousand uprooted trees. In fact, a flood or a tsunami or an earthquake or storm — all of them are examples of the natural functioning of the natural world. They occur because the earth is alive. Floods do not occur on the moon because the moon is mostly geologically inactive.\n\nWe choose to locate our homes or camps or tents in perilous locations where they are vulnerable to periodic catastrophes. That is not God’s fault. If we choose not to pay for advance warning systems that might enable people in risk zones to escape in time to save their lives, that is on us. None of it is on God.\n\nSome theologies, like that of Aristotle, leave us with a God who is unfeeling about our sufferings, but that is not the faith of the children of Abraham — Judaism, Christianity and Islam. We believe in a God who accompanies us through the sorrows of life. Our God does not promise us a world without floods, but God does promise us a world in which every rescuer is the hand of God.\n\nThe most famous Psalm is the 22nd Psalm and it is the most famous because it is the most healing. It is the most healing because it imagines God as a shepherd. A shepherd cannot save every sheep, but a good shepherd is always looking for members of the flock who are wandering through the valley of the shadow of death. God is our good shepherd, and I believe that God has set up camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River now.\n\nThere is another verse from the Bible that I lift up for you in these difficult times. It reminds us that everything comes from God, not just the good but also the deadly. It reminds us that when we pray to God we are not only praying for good things. We are also praying for help in the face of bad things. The ancient rabbis of Judaism taught, “The world is led by its own laws (Heb: olam k’minhago noheg). This means that nature’s laws are immutable, but it also means that God is the creator of those laws.\n\nBefore the rabbis, the great prophet Isaiah spoke the words of God in chapter 45:7 where this profound truth of a God who creates all things — all things not just happy things — all things not just life but also death. That is a fearsome but also loving God who is both good and great: “I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I, the Lord, do all these things.”",

    "News_title":"House gives final approval to Trump’s $9 billion cut to public broadcasting and foreign aid",
    "News_text":"The House gave final approval to President Donald Trump’s requestto claw back about $9 billionfor public broadcasting and foreign aid early Friday as Republicans intensified their efforts to target institutions and programs they view as bloated or out of step with their agenda.\n\nThe vote marked the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a rescissions request to Congress, and the White House suggested it won’t be the last. Some Republicans were uncomfortable with the cuts, yet supported them anyway, wary of crossing Trump or upsetting his agenda.\n\nThe House passed the bill by a vote of 216-213. It now goes to Trump for his signature.\n\n“We need to get back to fiscal sanity and this is an important step,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nOpponents voiced concerns not only about the programs targeted, but about Congress ceding its spending powers to the executive branch as investments approved on a bipartisan basis were being subsequently canceled on party-line votes. They said previous rescission efforts had at least some bipartisan buy-in and described the Republican package as unprecedented.\n\nNo Democrats supported the measure when it passed the Senate, 51-48, in the early morning hours Thursday. Final passage in the House was delayed for several hours as Republicans wrestled with their response to Democrats’ push for a vote on the release ofJeffrey Epsteinfiles.\n\nThe package cancels about $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and nearly $8 billion for a variety of foreign aid programs, many designed to help countries where drought, disease and political unrest endure.\n\nThe effort to claw back a sliver of federal spending came just weeks after Republicans also muscled throughTrump’s tax and spending cut billwithout any Democratic support. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that measure will increase the U.S. debt by about$3.3 trillionover the coming decade.\n\n“No one is buying the the notion that Republicans are actually trying to improve wasteful spending,” said Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe cancellation of $1.1 billion for the CPB represents the full amount it is due to receive during the next two budget years.\n\nThe White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.\n\nThe corporation distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming.\n\nDemocrats were unsuccessful in restoring the funding in the Senate.\n\nLawmakers with large rural constituencies voiced particular concern about what the cuts to public broadcasting could mean for some local public stations in their state.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the stations are “not just your news — it is your tsunami alert, it is your landslide alert, it is your volcano alert.”\n\nAs the Senate debated the bill Tuesday, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the remote Alaska Peninsula, triggering tsunami warnings on local public broadcasting stations that advised people to get to higher ground.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he secured a deal from the White House that some money administered by the Interior Department would be repurposed to subsidize Native American public radio stations in about a dozen states.\n\nBut Kate Riley, president and CEO of America’s Public Television Stations, a network of locally owned and operated stations, said that deal was “at best a short-term, half-measure that will still result in cuts and reduced service at the stations it purports to save.”\n\nAmong the foreign aid cuts are $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and family reunification for refugees and $496 million to provide food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts. There also is a $4.15 billion cut for programs that aim to boost economies and democratic institutions in developing nations.\n\nDemocrats argued that the Republican administration’s animus toward foreign aid programs would hurt America’s standing in the world and create a vacuum for China to fill.\n\n“This is not an America first bill. It’s a China first bill because of the void that’s being created all across the world,” Jeffries said.\n\nThe White House argued that many of the cuts would incentivize other nations to step up and do more to respond to humanitarian crises and that the rescissions best served the American taxpayer.\n\n“The money that we’re clawing back in this rescissions package is the people’s money. We ought not to forget that,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chair of the House Rules Committee.\n\nAfter objections from several Republicans, Senate GOP leaders took out a $400 million cut to PEPFAR, a politically popular program to combat HIV\/AIDS that is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nDemocrats say the bill upends a legislative process that typically requires lawmakers from both parties to work together to fund the nation’s priorities.\n\nTriggered by the official rescissions request from the White House, thelegislationonly needed a simple majority vote to advance in the Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to break a filibuster. That meant Republicans could use their 53-47 majority to pass it along party lines.\n\nTwo Republican senators, Murkowski and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, joined with Democrats in voting against the bill, though a few other Republicans also raised concerns about the process.\n\n“Let’s not make a habit of this,” said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who voted for the bill but said he was wary that the White House wasn’t providing enough information on what exactly will be cut.\n\nRuss Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the imminent successful passage of the rescissions shows “enthusiasm” for getting the nation’s fiscal situation under control.\n\n“We’re happy to go to great lengths to get this thing done,” he said during a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nIn response to questions about the relatively small size of the cuts -- $9 billion -- Vought said that was because “I knew it would be hard” to pass in Congress. Vought said another rescissions package is ’likely to come soon.”\n\nDownload theFREE WPXI News appfor breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Channel 11 News onFacebookandTwitter. |Watch WPXI NOW",

    "News_title":"3 L.A. County sheriff's deputies killed in explosion ID'd; investigators search Santa Monica apartment",
    "News_text":"Three deputies were killed Friday in an explosion at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Biscailuz Center Training Academy in East L.A., the deadliest incident for the agency in more than 160 years.\n\nDeputies with the arson explosives detail, an elite unit within the Sheriff's Department, were moving ordnance in the training center's parking lot about 7:30 a.m. when the blast occurred.\n\nThe deputies were identified Friday evening as Dets. Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus and William Osborn. They had served 19, 22 and 33 years with the department, respectively, authorities said.\n\nThe Sheriff's Department is currently investigating an apartment complex in the 800 block of Bay Street in Santa Monica in connection with the explosion, according to department spokesperson Nicole Nishida. The three deputies killed in the blast responded to a call to assist the Santa Monica Police Department at the complex on Thursday.\n\nThe explosion is being investigated as a negligent homicide, which could result in charges against the person who made or stored the device, law enforcement sources told The Times.\n\nThe Santa Monica Police Department evacuated residents from the Bay Street apartment building Friday afternoon, while authorities continue to search the location for any additional explosive material, Nishida said. The FBI and Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad are assisting with the investigation. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is expected to lead a federal probe into the cause of the explosion.\n\n\"They're the best of the best,\" Sheriff Robert Luna said of the agency's special enforcement bureau. \"And the individuals who work our arson explosives detail, they have years of training. ... They are fantastic experts, and unfortunately, I lost three of them today.”\n\nHe said it will take time — possibly weeks or months — to investigate the incident.\n\nOsborn, who joined the Sheriff's Department in 1992, was described as“one of [the] tenured bomb technicians regularly relied upon when faced with a new challenge\" in a department news release. He is survived by his wife, Det. Shannon Rincon, four sons and two daughters.\n\nKelley-Eklund joined the Sheriff's Department in 2006 and leaves behind his wife, Jessica Eklund, and their seven children. Prior to joining the arson explosives detail, he worked as a narcotics and murder investigator as well as a field training officer who mentored new deputies.\n\nLemus comes from a family of Sheriff's Department employees, including his wife, Det. Nancy Lemus; sisters Sgt. Belen Lemus, Deputy Perla Lemus and Custody Asst. Wendy Lemus; and brother-in-law Sgt. Robert Catalan. He joined the department in 2003 and was known for his ability to train fellow deputies and notable arrests involving career criminals. He leaves behind three daughters.\n\nA grenade was recovered at the Santa Monica apartment complex Thursday, a city police officer told The Times.\n\nMichael Kellman, who lives in the building, told The Times that a fellow tenant called the police Thursday after discovering a bag of grenades tucked away in her storage unit.\n\nShe has been living in the building for several years and believes the bag was left behind by the former occupant, he said. Authorities returned to her unit Friday to scour the apartment for any remaining explosives.\n\nThe bomb squad picks up potential explosives across the region on a daily basis, but it's a situation that's always fraught with danger because it's hard to assess the stability of materials and their age, law enforcement sources told The Times.\n\nAfter the explosion, the LAPD's bomb squad responded to the scene to help render any other potential explosive materials safe. It took authorities several hours to complete the process, Luna said.\n\nEmployees told The Times they heard a massive boom around 7:30 a.m. coming from the parking lot where the sheriff's bomb squad keeps its vehicles. They heard glass shattering and screaming.\n\nRich Pippin, president of the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, called it the \"worst day in the history of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\"\n\n\"You never get up in the morning expecting this kind of news, never, and sadly, as often as we deal with this, it does not get easier,\" he said. \"It never gets easier. It hurts.\"\n\nHundreds of people gathered in the street outside the East L.A. training center Friday evening for a procession to honor the fallen officers.\n\nThree coffins draped with American flags were loaded into trucks to be transported to the L.A. County Medical Examiner around 5 p.m. A massive American flag was hoisted between two fire truck ladders for the procession to pass through, while scores of law enforcement members somberly watched.\n\nIn radio communications reviewed by The Times, a sheriff's dispatcher told units that there was an \"explosion with three down.\" She later advised that a sheriff's weapons team leader said investigators should \"not approach\" the scene.\n\nIn the aftermath, officials covered the blast area with a large tarp as they collected evidence and worked to render the device safe. About 25 yards from the facility, glass was scattered across the parking lot from the windows of an SUV cruiser that were blown out by the explosion. A sheriff's helicopter circled over the area as multiple emergency vehicles streamed into the facility.\n\nAt one point, video from the scene showed a bomb technician in a blast suit approaching the site and removing some material before returning to the area where investigators were gathering evidence.\n\nEd Nordskog, a former member of the department’s arson explosives detail and a 34-year department veteran, said the agency's bomb and arson unit is one of the largest and busiest in the United States. The squad gets daily calls to handle military ordnance that spans from the modern era back to World War I, as well as commercial explosives, blasting dynamite from mining operations, suspicious packages and homemade or improvised items.\n\n\"All have different aspects that are dangerous,\" he said. \"It’s a job that requires at least a year of formal training to be able to work, and several years of field experience to feel fully proficient.\"\n\nFormer L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told KTLA-TV Channel 5 in an interview that the arson explosives detail includes some of the agency's most experienced personnel.\n\n\"The loss is just staggering,\" he said. \"It's gonna take a while to figure out how this happened, why this happened, could it have been prevented.\"\n\nThe explosion and resulting deaths sent shock waves across Los Angeles County and prompted many unanswered questions. Flags at county buildings were lowered to half-staff in mourning.\n\nTwo of the deputies who were killed were sometimes assigned to provide security at county board meetings in downtown Los Angeles, according to officials.\n\nL.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said she was \"heartbroken\" by the situation and that the entire county is grieving for the deputies and their families.\n\n\"These deputies went to work expecting to come home and they didn't,\" Barger said. \"I hope the takeaway is that we should all remember to have compassion and empathy and give law enforcement a break.\"\n\nJason Zabala, who works for the Sheriff's Department's SWAT team and was a colleague and friend of the deputies who died Friday, echoed Luna's comments that they were the \"best of the best.\" He was in shock, he said, his voice breaking as he talked about his friends.\n\n\"I can think of no greater honor, truly, than to die in the service of people,\" he said. \"That's why we sign up, and it's tragic, but I'm sure their families are proud of their service, as I am.\"\n\nThe dangers of the profession aren't lost on those who wear the uniform or their families, Zabala said, but it doesn't keep them from doing their jobs.\n\n\"You do this job for a reason. You don't really think about it day to day, until something like this happens, and then you realize how dangerous it really is,\" he said. \"I know our families go through that. I know my family goes through that probably every day. But we truly love the work we do.\"\n\nTony Meraz, a veteran sheriff's deputy who knew all three of the men killed in the explosion, said their deaths leave a void in the hearts of their friends, families and the department that will never be filled.\n\n\"All three of these men are the kind of cops that if your loved one calls 911, you want them to show up, whether it is an active shooter, a traffic collision or because your mom is lost,\" Meraz said. \"They are all gone in the blink of an eye.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said on X that he had been briefed on the explosion, and the state deployed investigative personnel from the Office of the State Fire Marshal to help determine what happened.\n\nU.S. Atty. Gen.

    "News_text":"July 18 (UPI) --A bill rescinding $1.1 billion in funds to public broadcasting is awaiting President Donald Trump's signature, and many critics, including some Republicans, say it will devastate some rural areas and even put the country in danger.\n\nThe claw-back bill will cut$9 billion in total, including major reductions to foreign aid. It passed the House early Friday morning.\n\nThe public stations already have received funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to get them through September. Once that money runs out,more than 100PBS and NPR stations are at risk of closing. The cuts will hit especially hard in rural areas.\n\nFor example, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake hit off the coast of Alaska on Wednesday. Public mediahelped broadcast a tsunami alert, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.\n\n\"Their response to today's earthquake is a perfect example of the incredible public service these stations provide,\" Murkowskisaid Wednesday on X. \"They deliver local news, weather updates, and, yes, emergency alerts that save human lives.\"\n\nMurkowski was one of two Republican senators who voted against the bill.\n\nThe effects of the cutting off of funding could be even wider-reaching than expected, obsersers said.\n\n\"Failing stations will create a cascade effect in this highly connected and interdependent system, impacting content producers and leading to the potential collapse of additional distressed stations in other areas of the country,\" Tim Isgitt, CEO of advisory firm Public Media Company, told The New York Times.\n\nAn analysis by non-profit Public Media Company identified 78 public radio organizations and 37 TV organizations that will likely close. They rely on funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for about 30% of their budgets.\n\n\"I think unfortunately this is cutting off their constituents' noses to spite NPR's face,\" NPR CEO Katherine Maher said Wednesday on CNN. \"It doesn't help anyone to take this funding away.\"\n\nPBS President and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement that the cuts \"will be especially devastating to smaller stations and those serving large rural areas.\"\n\n\"Many of our stations, which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts, will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\" she said.\n\nReporting on local issues will see cuts, too.\n\nMichigan's WKAR Public Media general manager Shawn Turner said he has already had to lay off nine staffers because of the impending cuts, noting that about 16% of WKAR's budget comes from federal funding.\n\nThe cuts will prevent the newsroom from doing investigations into issues like the impact of tariffs on Michigan's manufacturing industry, he said.\n\n\"We've been able to ask [reporters] to begin to do a deep dive in really understanding how that's going to impact the community so that we have that reporting ready to go,\" Turner said. \"Our ability to do that going forward is going to be limited.\"\n\nNative American areas will also suffer from the cuts.\n\nThey pose \"an immediate threat to the survival of small, rural, and Tribal stations across the country,\" saidLoris Taylor, head of Native Public Media.\n\n\"These hyperlocal stations, many of which are the only source of local news, emergency alerts, educational programming, and cultural preservation, operate with limited resources and rely on [the Corporation for Public Broadcasting] funding to stay on the air.\"\n\nTaylor heads a network of 57 Native radio stations. She hadprivately imploredSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., to reject the package, The New York Times reported Wednesday.\n\n\"Without this federal support, Native and rural communities stand to lose critical lifelines that connect them to the rest of the nation,\" she said.",

    "News_title":"Satellite Images Reveal Striking New Hole In Yellowstone National Park",
    "News_text":"Observant visitors to Yellowstone National Park’s Norris Geyser Basin, the home of the park’s famous Steamboat Geyser and the hottest and most dynamic geyser basin in the park, might notice something new this year: a gaping hole filled with milky blue water.\n\nThe hole was discovered by Yellowstone geologists back in April during their first visit to the Norris Basin in 2025. Located just to the west of a patch of vegetation informally known as “Tree Island,” it measures about 13 feet wide and the light blue water is warm, measuring about 109 degrees. It also presented the scientists with a mystery: when did it appear, and how was it created?\n\nFor the geologists, the milky pool was surrounded by clues. It was surrounded by quite a few small (up to one foot in width) rocks that appeared covered in light-gray, fine-grained, sandy mud, providing evidence that a hydrothermal explosion had occurred at some point during the preceding months … but when?\n\nThe team was able to use satellite images of the park to narrow down the timing of when the pool had been formed. The satellite imagery showed that as late as December 19, 2024, there were no signs of the hole. However, by January 6, a small depression had become visible on satellite. By the next month, the hole and the water within it were fully established.\n\nThe scientists wanted to know more. Particularly, they wondered if the hydrothermal explosion was associated with an earthquake swarm or another type of seismic event. Luckily, a new monitoring station that uses infrasound (low frequency acoustic energy) to detect hydrothermal activity had been installed in Norris Geyser Basin in 2023. While the team found no strong and unambiguous explosion signals during the time when the satellite imagery indicated the new pool had formed, they did uncover several low-level acoustic signals that came from the direction of the new feature.\n\nLooking at these low-level signals, the scientists were able to determine that, rather than happening all at once, this new pool was created by a gradual process that began on December 25, 2024 (Christmas!). It remains to be seen if the new feature will end up being given an Xmas-related name.\n\nSenior writer Chris DeWeese edits Morning Brief, The Weather Channel’s newsletter.",

    "News_text":"(WGHP) — Public broadcasters across the state of North Carolina are reacting after Congress approved cuts to federal funding, which could have a profound impact on the services they offer.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Senate voted 51-48 in favorof cutting $9 billion worth of federal funding from foreign aid and public media.On Friday, the House voted 216-213 in favor of the cuts.\n\nThe New York Times reportsthat around $1.1 billion from those cuts is money that was previously earmarked for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds both PBS and NPR.\n\nAccording to NPR, the nonprofit currently has over 1,000 stations that broadcast across the nation.The New York Times reportsthat a 2011 study conducted by NPR states that 18% of those 1,000+ stations would close if funding to the CPB were cut off.\n\nCurrently, there are nearly 30 NPR member stations in North Carolina, according to the North Carolina Music Office.\n\nCPB has come under criticism in recent years from some lawmakers due to accusations of bias.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) demanded answers from CPB about allegations of biased reporting from NPRin a news release in April 2024.\n\nCruz said in part:\n\n“I write today to express deep concern about National Public Radio’s (NPR) departure from its stated mission ‘to create a more informed public’ and to ‘distribute programming that meets the highest standards of public service in journalism.’ NPR markets itself as a longstanding beacon of independent journalism, which is a critical component in fostering an informed and engaged public. Yet recent developments reveal a deeply entrenched culture of political bias and partisanship that stands directly at odds with the purported mission of this taxpayer-funded media organization.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas)\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) also accused NPR of bias and stated that the organization should not be a taxpayer subsidy on Tuesday.\n\n“This is, in our view, the misuse of taxpayer dollars,”Johnson said in part. “They’re biased reporting. They’re not objective. They pretend to be so.”\n\nOther lawmakers have criticized the funding cuts, citing the role that public radio stations hold in emergencies and disasters.\n\n“These rural stations are often the lifeblood of these communities when it comes to emergency alerts,” said U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\n\n“A few hours ago, a magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck off the Alaska Peninsula, just south of Sand Point,”said U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). “Local residents and summer visitors alike were able to evacuate thanks to federal tsunami advisories relayed through local public broadcasting stations.”\n\nWinston-Salem’s WFDD 88.5 FM saysthat the $1.1 billion cuts will cause them a loss of around $300,000. While the station had been making cuts of its own in anticipation, it still remains at a substantial deficit and is now asking for community donations.\n\nWFDD’s full reaction can be read below:\n\n“As expected, late last night the House voted in favor of rescinding the $1.1B already approved to fund the CPB. This means a loss of approximately $300,000 for WFDD. While this is not the outcome we hoped for, it was also not unexpected.\n\n“Since February, we have been making cuts behind the scenes to anything we can in anticipation of this shortfall. Our goal was to trim as much as possible without impacting what you hear, but we’re still running in a significant deficit.\n\n“To minimize the impact on our operations, we’re asking our community to step up. Something as small as $5 a month may not be much to you, but it is huge to us. You can make a gift now at www.wfdd.org\/donate\n\n“Thank you to everyone who contacted their representatives, called, emailed, and left comments showing their support, or who have come out to our events to make their voices heard. You are the reason we do what we do. You are the public in public radio.”\n\nWFDD\n\nPBS North Carolina saysit will lose over $4 million annually as a result of federal funding cuts.\n\nPBS North Carolina’s full reaction can be read below:\n\nTo our North Carolina community:\n\n“This week, Congress passed a rescission bill eliminating previously approved federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting—an alarming step jeopardizing the foundation on which public media has been built.\n\n“Here in North Carolina, that funding represents a cut of more than $4 million annually—support that helps us provide trusted educational programming, maintain critical emergency communications infrastructure, and tell the stories that reflect and connect our communities.\n\n“To every individual who made their voice heard by calling an elected official, and to every member, donor, and partner who continues to stand with us—thank you. Your support fuels our work and fortifies our future.\n\n“This is a time of fundamental change for public media reminding us of our deep roots in the communities we serve. PBS North Carolina, then WUNC-TV, began in 1955, twelve years before the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Today, PBS North Carolina still belongs to the people of this state, and our commitment is unwavering.\n\n“While the loss of federal funding presents real challenges, remember, PBS North Carolina is more than a television network—we are part of the fabric of this state. We are here because of you, and we exist to serve you, now and always.\n\n“Thank you for standing with us during this pivotal time. Your support sends a clear message: North Carolinians are committed to public media for generations to come.\n\nWith deep gratitude,\n\nDavid Crabtree\n\nCEO and General Manager\n\nPBS North Carolina\n\nChapel Hill’s WUNC 91.5 FM, also known as North Carolina Public Radio,says it will lose $800,000 in annual support as a result of the federal funding cuts.The station also says that the loss in funding will create “immediate and significant challenges.”\n\nCharlotte’s WFAE 90.7 FM saysit will be letting go of six people from its work staff “as it faces a difficult revenue environment and the loss of federal funding due to the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Congress approves public media and foreign aid cuts: What to know",
    "News_text":"Congress this week approved a bill that claws back about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds, as Republicans look to begin locking in cuts pursued by his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe package includes about $8 billion in cuts for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and other foreign aid, as well as more than $1 billion in cuts to the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides some funding to NPR and PBS.\n\nHere are five things to know about the bill.\n\nThe bill yanks back more than $1 billion in advanced funding appropriated for CPB over fiscal years 2026 and 2027.\n\nMany Republicans say the cuts are long overdue, singling out NPR and PBS, for what they perceive as political bias. But some are concerned about how the cuts would impact smaller stations.\n\nIn the previous fiscal year, NPRreceivedupwards of $13 million from CPB, the corporation’sgrants andallocationsdata shows. More than $70 million went to PBS based in Arlington.\n\nAbout one percentof NPR’s current operating budget comes directly from the federal government, compared to 15 percent for PBS,multiple outlets report.\n\nAt the same time, however, fees from member stations, which rely on a larger share of CPB funding on average, make up about 30 percent of NPR’s funding. PBS says it also receives annual programming dues from stations to carry national programming.\n\nAbout 35 percent of the annual funding for PBS News Hour, the organizationsaid, comes from CPB and national programming funds it described as “a combination of CPB appropriation funds and annual programming dues paid to PBS by stations re-allocated to programs like ours.”\n\nOpponents of the cuts have already sounded alarm about the fiscal “cliff” that some stations will face as a result of the latest legislation come October, the start of fiscal year 2026.\n\n“It is a cliff,” Rep. Rosa Delauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told The Hill Thursday. “They’re already speaking about it, frightened to death, particularly in rural communities that they’re not going to have access to important information or alerts about weather situations, information that they need to know, education for their kids, because they’re not in communities where there are multiple sources of information.”\n\nIn a statement responding to passage of the cuts on Friday, CPB president Patricia Harrisonsaid“many local public radio and television stations will be forced to shut down.”\n\n“Cutting federal funding could also put Americans at risk of losing national and local emergency alerts that serve as a lifeline to many Americans in times of severe need,” Harrison also said.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle have raised similar concerns.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) saidat the Hill Nation Summit on Wednesdaythat the cuts could put rural radio stations in her home state out of business, calling them “the lifeblood of these communities when it comes to emergency alerts.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), one of two Republicans in the upper chamber to vote against the bill, pointed to a recent earthquake in her home state.\n\nSeven-point-three [magnitude] earthquake off of Alaska and tsunami warnings. You know how I got this information? From public broadcasting,” she said on the Senate floor.\n\nLess than 5 percent of the nonprofit corporation’s funding goes toward its operations, while more than 70 percent “goes directly to local public media stations,” CPBstateson its website. And almost half of its “total 544 radio and TV grantees are considered rural.”\n\nHowever, many Republicans have downplayed the cuts.\n\n“There’s so many means for communications now that we didn’t have in the 1960s. Everyone has it on their phone,” Rep. Mark Alford (R-Missouri) told The Hill this week. “Everyone, pretty much, has a smartphone, even in rural districts that that I represent, there’s all types of access for information that we didn’t have in the 1960s”\n\n“I don’t think the American taxpayer should be funding journalism,” Alford, who is also a former television newsanchor, also said, while arguing there’s a “liberal, progressive bent towards NPR and PBS.”\n\nThe request initially sent by the White House called for $8.3 billion in cuts to USAID and other foreign aid.\n\nBut the White House ended upagreeing to exemptthe President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which was established under former President George W. Bush in 2003 and totaled about $400 million, after those cuts became a critical point of contention for moderate GOP lawmakers.\n\nThe administration said the bill targets items like migration and refugee assistance that “could be more fairly shared with non-U.S. Government donors,” USAID efforts officials say have been used to “fund radical gender and climate projects,” and development assistance they argued “conflict with American values” and “interfere with the sovereignty of other countries,” among other rescissions.\n\nRepublicans in both chambers have overwhelmingly cheered the cuts. But a few have also voiced concerns about the proposal in recent weeks, sounding alarm over what they see as a lack of information about the accounts being targeted.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) specifically singled out a proposed $2.5 billion in cuts to the Development Assistance account. She noted in a statement that the account “covers everything from basic education, to water and sanitation, to food security,” but said lawmakers still lacked key details as to how those programs would be affected.\n\nRepublicans see the bill as a critical “test run” for the party, as Trump administration officials have already indicated they aim tosend multiple special requeststo Congress to claw back more funding if the first package makes it through.\n\nWhite House budget chief Russell Vought said Thursday that another rescissions package is “likely to come soon,” though he stopped short of offering specifics as to what programs could be on the chopping block.\n\n“Have nothing to announce, but we’ve been talking about it, and there’s certainly an enthusiasm, although,” Vought said. “I spent a good hour with Senate Republicans, there is still a great enthusiasm for these rescissions bills, because Congress wants to be a part of voting for these cuts and making them permanent.”\n\nHardline conservatives have ramped up calls in recent months for the president to use the rare “rescissions” tool – which unlocks a process that Republicans can use to secure funding cuts with GOP-only votes – as the party looks to codify DOGE cuts amid legal challenges over the administration’s efforts to reshape the federal government.\n\nFewer than 20 legislative days stand between Congress and a looming Sept. 30 deadline to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nBoth chambers arerunning behind in marking upand pushing their annual funding bills across the floor — increasing the likelihood Congress will have to resort to a stopgap measure to keep the lights on and buy time for lawmakers to finish their funding work.\n\nSenate Democrats have already warned the passage of the recent rescissions packagethreatens already fragile bipartisan funding talks.\n\nAnd some Republicans are also eager to begin shifting more focus to crafting and approving new funding levels for fiscal 2026.\n\nAsked about the administration’s plansto send Congress additional requests for cuts, Murkowski, a senior GOP appropriator, said, “I do not think that should be our path.”\n\n“It’s not legislating. It’s basically the White House saying this is what we want you to do. Take it or leave it,” she told reporters this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

(res.) Yossi Pinto toldWallaabout the brigade's actions during theIsrael-Iran warin an interview published on Friday.\n\nPinto described how he received a call from Home Front Command's headquarters on June 12 when Operation Rising Lion began. He was told, \"It's happening,\" before he hung up, and immediately called his four unit commanders.\n\nWhile the brigade has been deployed nationwide since the start of theIsrael-Hamas war, Pinto noted that the Home Front Command understood that the risk of damage from Iranian missile strikes was more serious.\n\nThe Search and Rescue brigade, which is ready for immediate action year-round, including boarding a plane and landing in disaster zones, began sharpening its capabilities and increasing readiness and alertness to the highest levels.\n\nWe are always on alert, Pinto stated. \"In every private vehicle, you’ll find a ready-to-use rescue kit. One of the commanders was on his way abroad with his family. He turned the car around and rushed to the designated place according to the combat procedure. What was on my mind at that moment? Long days, for a month of fighting. That’s what I told everyone. I imagined heavy destruction events. On the first day, at the first situation assessment, I told everyone: This is the test of our lives. The brigade was designed for this moment.\"\n\nMaj. A, is a 37-year-old reserve officer, married to a software engineer and a father of three, who is a mechanical engineer in his civilian life. However, he is also a company commander in the brigade. When a ballistic missile from Iranfell in Bat Yam, he was nearby in Holon with his soldiers.\n\n\"We heard the booms and understood that there's been an impact,\" A said.\n\n\"Our procedure is clear, to act. I arrived at the site carrying initial rescue equipment and search tools. We ran hundreds of meters to the impact site. There was chaos at the scene, destruction, injured people, civilians, a lot of people,\" he added.\n\n\"We started working. Our goal is to rescue as quickly as possible. I started to climb the impact site, seeing a 10-story building, with parts of the building, about one and a half floors in height, destroyed. Ten apartments, gone. There are a lot of response units, but you feel alone, in a deathly silence, a silence that you can't explain,\" he continued.\n\n\"What's the hardest part of searching through damaged apartments? Children,\" A stated. \"There were two kids in the rubble. Later, we found an elderly woman who was dead. Dealing with the deceased is a difficult event.\"\n\n\"These are people whose home this was. There are worried civilians, and I need to get them to help us with the rescue, to know where to search. There’s always that one person looking for their mother. We will get them to a safe place, treat them briefly, gain details from them, and continue the search,\" A added.\n\n\"They have to ignore background noise. They could easily get sucked into a civilian screaming in hysterical stress. The teams are trained for these situations.

    "News_title":"Discover Avola, the Italian town that feeds the world’s almond craze",
    "News_text":"Avola, set in the heart of Sicily’s Ionian coast, might be unknown to many at first glance. But behind its humble name lies the beating heart of a successful business, where the almonds produced are considered among the finest in the world. With its strategic position, overlooking the Gulf of Noto, it has a rich history intertwined with the art of the almond cultivation (from Italian‘mandorla’) that has been shaped by the influence of Phoenician and biblical symbolism, creating a one-of-a-kind cultural and gastronomic legacy.\n\n“Centuries of tradition and hard-work, passed down from generation to generation, are rooted in Avola’s fertile lands” says Salvatore Rizzo, a third-generation farmer raised in the town. “The quality of these almonds is the result of intensive irrigation techniques first introduced by the Arabs, that helped turn this nut into a cornerstone of the Italian patisserie”.\n\nAvola, commonly known as the hexagonal city, preserves a deep identity typical of a true Mediterranean melting pot. The town was once seen as a golden land for its position along the Sicilian coastline, which inevitably attracted Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines, each of whom left an indelible mark. With an earthquake in 1693, much of this legacy was shaken, making Avola a living mosaic of Sicily’s layered past.\n\nToday, the past can be seen through its still-standing Baroque places of worship, historical buildings, old recipes, and stunning landscapes.\n\n“I’ve always been drawn by Avola’s quiet resilience, seen through the eyes of locals. It feels like being suspended between past and future,\" says Rizzo. “On a normal day, you’ll spot kids enjoying almond biscuits and elders pouring soap mixture into molds, still makingscibinaby hand.\" Over the centuries, there’s still a creativity that doesn’t come prepackaged and it’s rare in nearby bigger cities.\n\n(10 must-do experiences in Sicily)\n\nThe method of growing almonds from Avola’s almond trees—also known asmandorlo—follows the rhythms of nature. Trees are carefully planted by hand, spaced far apart to allow their root systems to stretch deep into the volcanic soil. A testament to meticulous selection can be seen in the harvesting process, done by hand, aided by gently shaking off the branches to loosen the ripe Pizzuta almonds. Today, farmers manage the work without any artificial tools, unlike in ancient times when irrigation was essential.\n\nMuch of Avola’s almonds are used to make traditional Sicilian sweets, from marzipan and rich cassata to sugared almonds. Beyond the kitchen, they are used by the cosmetic industry, where their oils and creams are renowned for their soothing properties.\n\n(Ancient ruins, city tours and cannoli on a family tour of western Sicily)\n\n“The almond tree of Avola is still nurtured thanks to methods that have nothing to do with modern agriculture and is probably one of the first introduced crops by conquerors of the Sicilian coast” says Rizzo. \"Avola’s porous soil lives in symbiosis with Southern Italy’s dry summers and mild winters, which create great conditions for the healthy blooming of its prized almonds.”\n\nOne of the oldest and most renowned almond producers in Avola is Nastasi Mandorle, a family-run business with two locations in town, just a few miles from Syracuse. The company’s roots date back to 1898, when entrepreneur Lorenzo Nastasi, together with his two sisters, began cultivating almonds in the surrounding countryside.\n\nNastasi practices a dry-farming approach, which relies entirely on natural rainfall and the nutrient-rich soil of Avola. Given the particular terrain and the summer blossoming, almonds are harvested from July to September, carefully hulled and sun-dried for three days, in order to preserve their sweet oils and woody hull, also namedmallo.\n\nNastasi: A trusted name in the almond business, Nastasi’s factory is a stop you can’t miss if you’re a food enthusiast. The well-stocked store offers a wide range of products, from silvered and whole-peeled almonds to fragrant almond pastes, pistachios, and hazelnuts. A visit to this place guarantees a full immersion in Avola’s almond history.\n\nNama: Nama is a family-run business founded by the Tiralongos. If you are looking for a sweet snack, head here. This centuries-old factory welcomes its visitors with a curated selection of Avola’s finest nuts, including fresh almonds, organic products (creams, almond oil), and nut pestos, all made with devotion to the land.\n\nPippo Si Pappa Bar: This lovely cafe is famous for its silky and fresh almond granita (rated the best in town), warmed brioche, local ricotta, and artisanal ice-cream.\n\nAvola offers countless charming accommodations for a relaxing stay.Morfeo Charming Rooms & Relaxis the best option to quickly reach the city center, and it features a private pool, a spacious garden, and suites with private balconies.Le Torrette Rooms and Apartmentsis a cozy bed-and-breakfast with its own restaurant and a bicycle rental service, which is a perfect way to explore the coast.\n\nAvola is an urban jewel year-long, but it’s best enjoyed in summer (July-September), when you can sunbathe on beaches with crystal-clear waters and witness the almond harvest. October is a good compromise for those who are more inclined toward tasting tours. The temperature is pleasantly breezy, and never too hot.\n\nAvola is easy to reach from major Italian metropolises. Flights from Catania Fontanarossa (CTA) or Comiso Airport operate all year-long. Alternatively, you can take a high-speed train to Catania (Italo or Frecciarossa), followed by a bus to Avola that takes about 1.5 hours.\n\n(How chocolate went from rough to refined in one Sicilian town)\n\nMaria Salvati is an Italian freelance journalist and copywriter.

    "News_title":"From dying reefs to flooded graves, Vanuatu is leading a global climate case",
    "News_text":"PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) — When John Warmington first began diving the reefs outside his home in Vanuatu’s Havannah Harbor a decade ago, the coral rose like a sunken forest — tall stands of staghorns branched into yellow antlers, plate corals layered like canopies, and clouds of darting fish wove through the labyrinth.\n\n“We used to know every inch of that reef,” he said. “It was like a friend.”\n\nNow, it’s unrecognizable. After Cyclone Pam battered the reef in 2015, sediment from inland rivers smothered the coral beds. Crown-of-thorns starfish swept in and devoured the recovering polyps. Back-to-back cyclones in 2023 crushed what was left. Then, in December 2024, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake shook the seabed.\n\nWhat remains is a coral graveyard — bleached rubble scattered across the seafloor, habitats collapsed, life vanished. “We’ve come out of the water in tears,” said Warmington, who has logged thousands of dives on this single reef. “We just see heartbreak.”\n\nThat heartbreak is becoming more common across this Pacific island nation, where intensifying cyclones, rising seas and saltwater intrusion are reshaping coastlines and threatening daily life. Since 1993, sea levels around Vanuatu’s shores have risen by about 6 millimeters (.24 inches) per year — significantly faster than the global average — and in some areas, tectonic activity has doubled that rate.\n\nInternational court to opine on nations' obligations to address climate change\n\nOn Wednesday, Vanuatu will get its day in the world’s highest court. The International Court of Justice will issue an advisory opinion on what legal obligations nations have to address climate change and what consequences they may face if they don’t. The case, led by Vanuatu and backed by more than 130 countries, is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law.\n\n“Seeing large, polluting countries just continue business as usual and not take the climate crisis seriously can get really sad and disappointing,” said 16-year-old climate activist Vepaiamele Trief. “If they rule in our favor, that could change everything.”\n\nThe opinion won't be legally binding, but could help shape future efforts to hold major emitters accountable and secure the funding and action small island nations need to adapt or survive.\n\nIt comes after decades of frustration for Pacific nations who’ve watched their homelands disappear. In Tuvalu, where the average elevation is just 2 meters (6.6 feet), more than a third of the population has applied for a climate migration visa to Australia. By 2100, much of the country is projected to be under water at high tide. In Nauru, the government has begun selling passports to wealthy foreigners — offering visa-free access to dozens of countries — in a bid to generate revenue for possible relocation efforts.\n\n“The agreements being made at an international level between states are not moving fast enough,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister for climate change. “They're definitely not being met according to what the science tells us needs to happen.”\n\nVanuatu has already sought opinions from other international courts and is pushing for the recognition of ecocide — the destruction of the environment — as a crime under the International Criminal Court. “We have to keep fighting till the last bit,” Regenvanu said.\n\nHow climate change is decimating Vanuatu\n\nFor children in Vanuatu, climate change isn’t a theory — it’s a classroom, or the lack of one.\n\nAt Sainte Jeanne D’Arc school on Efate Island, elementary school teacher Noellina Tavi has spent two of the last three years teaching her students in tents — first after the 2023 cyclones and again following the 2024 earthquake.\n\nWith a shortage of emergency tents, her class was combined with another. Students fidget and lose focus. “It’s too crowded,” Tavi said. “We can’t work peacefully.”\n\nWhen it rains, the tents turn cold and muddy. Tavi often sends students home so they don’t get sick. Anytime a storm approaches, the tents must be dismantled, the furniture carried to shelter and the children sent home. “That disrupts their education for a whole week,” she said.\n\nIn rural areas, extreme weather hits something even more basic: food security. On Nguna Island, farmer Kaltang Laban has watched cyclones wipe out the banana, cassava and taro crops that feed his community.\n\n“After a cyclone, we would have nothing for months,” he said. Now, with support from Save the Children, Laban and other farmers are storing preserved fruits and vegetables in a facility beside their gardens. “But not every community has this,” he said.\n\nMore than 70% of Vanuatu’s population lives in rural areas and depends on small-scale farming.\n\nIn 2025, USAID cut funding for a rainwater harvesting initiative designed to improve water access at cyclone evacuation centers in one of the country’s most remote, drought-prone provinces, said Vomboe Shem, climate lead for Save the Children Vanuatu. The materials had already been shipped and distributed, but the project was halted.\n\n“These disasters are happening over and over again,” Shem said. “It’s pushing our communities to their limits.”\n\nNot all of these impacts can be pinned solely on climate change, said Christina Shaw, CEO of the Vanuatu Environmental Science Society. Coastal development, tectonic sinking, volcanic eruptions, deforestation and pollution are also contributing to ecosystem decline.\n\n“Vanuatu’s environment is quite fragile by its inherent nature in that it’s young with narrow reefs, has small amounts of topsoil and is insulted regularly by natural disasters,” she said. “But we do have to think about the other human impacts on our environment as well.”\n\nThe damage isn’t limited to homes, gardens and reefs — it’s reaching into places once thought to be untouchable.\n\nOn the island of Pele, village chief Amos Kalsont sits at his brother’s grave as waves lap against broken headstones half-buried in sand. At high tide, both his brother's and father’s graves sit just a few arm's lengths from the sea. Some homes and gardens have already been moved inland, and saltwater intrusion has tainted the community’s primary drinking water source. Now, the community is considering relocating the entire village — but that would mean leaving the land their grandparents cleared by hand.\n\n“The sea is catching up and we don’t know what else to do,” Kalsont said. “It’s not fair that we have to face the consequences when we didn’t contribute to this in the first place.”\n\nMany in Vanuatu remain committed to building something stronger and hope the rest of the world will support them.\n\n“This is our future, and it’s particularly our children’s future, our grandchildren’s future,” said Regenvanu. “We just have to keep pushing for the best one we can.”\n\nBack in Havannah Harbor, John Warmington still dives the reef he considers part of his family. While much of it is gone, he and his wife Sandy have begun replanting coral fragments in hopes of restoring what’s left.\n\n“Our friend is still here,” he said. “Life is coming back.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Annika Hammerschlag on Instagram@ahammergram.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "News_title":"Explainer-Why China's neighbours are worried about its new mega-dam project",
    "News_text":"By David Stanway\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) -China has broken ground on what it says will be the world's largest hydropower project, a $170 billion feat capable of generating enough electricity each year to power Britain.\n\nThe scheme dwarfs the mighty Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's largest, and Chinese construction and engineering stocks surged after Premier Li Qiang unveiled it on the weekend.\n\nFor Beijing, the project promises clean power, jobs and a jolt of stimulus for a slowing economy. For neighbours downstream, it stirs old anxieties about water security: the Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra in India and Bangladesh, a lifeline for millions.\n\nWHAT EXACTLY DID CHINA APPROVE?\n\nThe plan involves five dams along a 50‑km stretch where the river plunges 2,000 metres off the Tibetan Plateau. First power is expected to be generated in the early‑to‑mid 2030s, but beyond that and the price tag, China has published little information about how it intends to build the project.\n\nWHY ARE NEIGHBOURS CONCERNED\n\nThat lack of information is compounding fears about water security in India and Bangladesh, which rely on the Brahmaputra for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.\n\nThe chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China, said earlier this year that the dam could dry out 80% of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas such as neighbouring Assam state.\n\nIn addition to water, the dam will also mean less sediment flowing downstream, according to Michael Steckler, a professor at Columbia University. That sediment carries nutrients essential for agriculture on floodplains downstream.\n\nIndia and China fought a border war in this region in the 1960s, and the lack of transparency from Beijing has helped fuel speculation it might use the dam to cut off water in another conflict, according to Sayanangshu Modak, an expert on the India-China water relationship at the University of Arizona.\n\n\"The construction of the Yarlung Zangbo hydropower project is a matter within the scope of China’s sovereign affairs,\" Beijing's foreign ministry said on Tuesday, adding the dam would provide clean energy and prevent flooding.\n\n\"China has also conducted necessary communication with downstream countries regarding hydrological information, flood control, and disaster mitigation cooperation related to the Yarlung Zangbo project,\" the ministry said.\n\nIndia's foreign and water ministries did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWILL IT STARVE INDIA OF WATER?\n\nBut the impact of the dam on downstream flows has been overstated, in part because the bulk of the water that enters the Brahmaputra is from monsoon rainfall south of the Himalayas, and not from China, said Modak.\n\nHe added that China's plans are for a \"run of the river\" hydropower project, which means the water will flow normally along the usual course of the Brahmaputra.\n\nIndia itself has proposed two dams on the Siang river, its name for the Yarlung Zangbo. One, an 11.5-gigawatt project in Arunachal Pradesh, will be India's largest if it goes ahead.\n\nThose have been proposed, in part, to assert India's claims on the river and bolster its case should China ever seek to divert the water, Modak added.\n\n\"If India can show that it has been using the waters, then China cannot unilaterally divert,\" he said.\n\nCONTROVERSY IS COMMON\n\nQuarrels over dams and water security are not new. Pakistan has accused India of weaponising shared water supplies in the disputed Kashmir region after New Delhi suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty, which regulates water sharing between the neighbours.\n\nIn Egypt, a senior politician was once caught on camera proposing to bomb a controversial Nile river dam planned by Ethiopia during a long-running dispute over the project.\n\nEARTHQUAKE AND EXTREME WEATHER RISKS\n\nThe dam will be built in an earthquake zone also prone to landslides, glacial‑lake floods and storms. A spree of dam building in the area sparked concerns from experts about safety following a devastating earthquake in Tibet earlier this year.\n\nA much smaller hydropower project on a nearby tributary has been limited to four‑month construction windows because of engineering challenges in high altitudes and vicious winters.\n\n​\n\n(Reporting by David Stanway in Singapore; Additional reporting by Colleen Howe in Beijing; Writing by Lewis Jackson; Editing by Saad Sayeed)",

    "News_title":"State Comptroller warns of serious flaws in buildings' earthquake and missile preparedness",
    "News_text":"The State Comptroller reports alarming gaps in buildings' earthquake preparedness, highlighting serious risks of missile hits and blasts to apartments and structures in the event of a disaster.\n\nTheState Comptroller’s Officefound a serious lack of involvement by local authorities in treating dangerous structures when it comes to earthquake preparedness, which carries implications for protection from missile hits and blast impacts, it said in its comprehensive annual report on local governance released on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the State ComptrollerMatanyahu Englman, “Even after we repeatedly warned the government, it has not internalized the inherent danger in the 810,000 apartments that cannot withstand an earthquake. More than anything, theIranian missilesexemplified the gap between older structures and newer ones.”\n\n“Our estimate is that only 10% of the buildings were included in municipal renewal plans. This is yet another critical red flag to the government, which must propose a solution as soon as possible, and not wait for the next emergency situation, the results of which could be disastrous,” he said.\n\nA 2021 State Comptroller report pointed the finger specifically at the Interior and Construction and Housing Ministries, as well as at the Prime Minister’s Office. It also found no working, functional relationship between local authorities and government offices on the matter, which had not been righted since.\n\nSince the last report, only 10% of the buildings that neededstructural reinforcementshad been included in municipal plans.\n\nThroughout the Israel-Hamas War and the missile barrages from Iran and its Yemeni proxy Houthi group, 1,342 buildings were struck in a significant way, as of March. Alarm bells were already sounded by the State Comptroller in 2022 regarding the dangers embedded in the old buildings’ structures, when there were about 810,000 apartments that required structural reinforcements.\n\nOf these, 10% – 84,532 units – were slated for reinforcements. Yet, 45 local authorities did not pass supplementary legislation to advance such reinforcements, and the Interior Ministry did not ensure that these laws would be updated. So far, only 17 local authorities have passed such legislation, including Bat Yam and Kiryat Yam.\n\nEighty-eight percent of the buildings in this category were built prior to 1992 – before new regulations kicked in. Four hundred and thirty-nine were located in Bat Yam, while 17 were located in Beersheba.\n\nOf the buildings marked as lacking since 2015, between 60% and 100% of the structures in Beersheba were treated within the first two years, while in Bat Yam, between 59% and 89% of these buildings were not treated. In fact, 53 of these buildings – 25% – are not slated for improvements.\n\nPer media reports and ones from local authorities, hundreds of buildings were struck or declared dangerous in the last missile volley series from Iran.\n\nAs of last month, in Ramat Gan, 257 buildings were directly or indirectly hit and damaged; five of them received demolition orders, four were destroyed, five more were declared dangerous, and 64 were given the status of limited access.\n\nIn Bat Yam, about 110 buildings were struck, which translates to roughly 2,000 apartments. Estimates are that most will be reconstructed and usable again eventually, but it is estimated that some will be destroyed.\n\nIn Beersheba, about 154 apartments were struck and deemed unsuitable for living. In Holon, five buildings were designated for destruction. As for Ness Ziona, 300 homes and apartments were hit, and in Haifa, 64 apartments were struck, along with dozens of businesses and offices with damages estimated at tens of millions of shekels.\n\nIn Petah Tikva, one building that was directly hit will likely be populated again in a year following renovations. One hundred and fifty buildings were damaged in Tel Aviv overall.\n\nThe report also found that the Interior and the Construction and Housing Ministries failed to update the requirements for employees working on these structures, and also did not provide supplementary training.\n\nThese buildings are also not being inspected periodically and consistently, despite committee recommendations to do so, dating back 16 years. This extends to public buildings as well, not just residential ones, including schools.\n\nOverall, the report did find that the municipalities had righted some of the wrongs from the last report, but that this was still lacking; further government involvement is needed.\n\nAlon Hachmon, Batya Giladi and Moshe Cohen contributed to this report.",

    "News_text":"Earthquakes areviolent eventsthat alter the face of the planet. In many cases, those changes occurbeneath the surfaceand onlygradually become visibleover thousands of years. Occasionally, however, an earthquake’s effects aren’t just felt—they’re seen. It’s even rarer to actually capture one of those moments on camera, but according to seismologists at Japan’s Kyoto University, the footage highlights thefirst-known videoof a strike-slip fault. Their analysis, published inThe Seismic Record, has led to new findings based on real-time visual evidence of tectonic motion.\n\nThe magnitude 7.7event took placeon March 28 along the Sagaing Fault with an epicenter near Myanmar’s second-largest city, Mandalay. Although the initial rupture process lasted barely 80 seconds, it and numerous aftershocks were ultimately responsible for 5,456 confirmed deaths and over 11,000 injuries. Later evaluations indicated the quake was the second deadliest in modern history, as well as the most powerful to hit Myanmar in over a century. According to aseparate group’s paperpublished in the same journal, the southern portion of the rupture occurred at an astonishing 3.7 miles per second—fast enough to qualify as “supershear velocity.”\n\nAmid the catastrophe, an outdoor CCTV camera about 74.5 miles south of the epicenter recorded a visceral illustration of its power. Over just a few moments, what at first looks like a single chunk of the ground appears to suddenly divide and horizontally shift past one another in opposite directions. Completely by accident, the camera recorded a direct look of a strike-slip fault, something previously analyzed by remote seismic instruments. To researchers at Kyoto University, the clip wasn’t just a jaw-dropping scene—it was an opportunity to study a strike-slip fault using visual data.\n\n“We did not anticipate that this video record would provide such a rich variety of detailed observations,” corresponding author and geologist Jesse Kearsesaid in a statement. “Such kinematic data is critical for advancing our understanding of earthquake source physics.”\n\nKearse and colleagues utilized a technique called pixel cross-correlation to analyze the fault movement on a frame-by-frame basis. Their findings showed the fault slipped horizontally by 8.2 feet in only 1.3 seconds, with a maximum speed of about 10.5 feet per second. While the movement matched experts’ existing knowledge of strike-slip ruptures, the short duration and speed were new developments.\n\n“The brief duration of motion confirms a pulse-like rupture, characterized by a concentrated burst of slip propagating along the fault, much like a ripple traveling down a rug when flicked from one end,” Kearse explained.\n\nAdditional examinations also proved that the slip path was slightly curved, confirming previous observations recorded elsewhere in the world. This means subtly curving strike-slips instead of totally linear ones may be the rule, not the exception.\n\n“Overall, these observations establish a new benchmark for understanding dynamic rupture processes,” the study’s authors wrote, adding that the video offers real-time confirmation of curved slip paths while helping “deepen our understanding of the physical mechanisms that control rapid fault slip during large earthquakes.”\n\nSuch discoveries may also help seismologists, geologists, and urban plannersdesign more resilient architectureto ensure that when major earthquakes inevitably occur, their damage is minimized as much as possible.",

    "News_title":"Texas flood survivors offer mixed reviews of FEMA as the agency awaits uncertain future",
    "News_text":"As contaminated Guadalupe River water receded following the deadly flooding in Kerrville, Texas, this month, residents returned to find their homes, vehicles and businesses destroyed. Shelled-shocked and in urgent need to rebuild, many turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the embattled organization created to assist people in the aftermath of natural disasters.\n\nThe responses they received ranged from “fantastic” to unhelpful to frustrating, residents told NBC News. Their experiences come as FEMA faces a future in which it may be dramatically reshaped or shuttered altogether at the direction of the Trump White House and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the agency.\n\nTimothy Gloria, of Kerrsville, said his FEMA experience has been exasperating. He was called home from his job the morning of the floods by a neighbor who was hanging onto a tree as waters rose. Gloria arrived around 6 a.m. to find his friend safe, but Gloria’s and his father’s cars, his motorcycle and an outside air conditioning unit were washed away, and the fence around his home was destroyed.\n\nA few days later, on the phone with a FEMA worker, he said he answered 21 questions about the damage to his property to receive emergency relief.\n\nFEMA initially awarded him $50, he said.\n\n“That’s like gas money,” Gloria, 41, told NBC News. “And I didn’t even get the $50. It was approved, but I still haven’t seen it.” He said the FEMA website indicated the money had been transferred to his account.\n\nFurther frustrating him, he said, his initial contact with a FEMA representative stopped answering his calls.\n\n“She was nowhere to be found,” he said. “I was expecting a lot more from FEMA.”\n\nJohn Mroczek lost a motorhome and two motorcycles in the flood. His head spinning, he sought out FEMA, which had set up a response center in the gymnasium at a church on Washington Street. Upon arrival, he was immediately struck by the agency’s presence.\n\n“FEMA is there waiting for you,” he said. “They were fantastic. They sign you in, you sit down, and they get right to it. They’ll do anything, from setting up your phone with its app to guiding you to whatever you need.”\n\nThe stark contrast in experiences with FEMA in Kerrville serves as a case study for the agency that President Donald Trump has said hewants “remade.”DHS Secretary Noem has said the agency “should not exist” as is. On Monday, the head of urban search and rescue at FEMA, Ken Pagurek, announced he would step down amid sweeping changes at the agency, including the requirement that Noem approves contracts over $100,000. Meanwhile, despite somestaff cuts, the agency plows ahead in Texas, where132 people died.\n\nAll of this comes as 20 states have announced a lawsuit againstFEMA over the termination of a pre-disaster mitigation program that, over the last four years, provided nearly $4.5 billion in funding to 2,000 projects across the country.\n\nFEMA and DHS did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nBut former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told NBC News that the contrasting reaction to the agency’s efforts is not surprising. ​​\n\n“Recovery is really complex,” she said. “There is a tendency by many to oversimplify what it takes to recover and rebuild a community, and especially to rebuild it in a way that makes it more resilient.”\n\nCriswell added that FEMA is not an agency that comes in and takes over. Rather, it supplements local and state authority before, during and after natural disasters. “It really takes a partnership between either the individual and their case worker or the local emergency manager and the state with their FEMA representative,” she said. “They have to work together to help rebuild the community in a way that is going to also make it stronger and more resilient to future weather events like the one they experienced.”\n\nShortly after the flooding disaster in Texas, Rob Kelly, the county judge, or chief executive, said businesses’ losses in Kerrville are likely to hover around $240 million. The county is reportedly consideringraising property taxesto help with the infrastructure rebuild, which has prompted local protests. Kelly saidFEMA would reimbursethe city for emergency response costs. “But they’re slow,” he noted. “The last time we had a big FEMA project, it took at least two, if not three years” to receive funding, he said.\n\nTeresa Offut, the office manager at Rio Robles RV Park in Kerrville, said FEMA’s most glaring response failures — includingHurricane Katrinain New Orleans and Mississippi in 2005, Hurricane Maria 2017 inPuerto Ricoand Hurricane Helene in westernNorth Carolinain 2024 — were not apparent in Kerrville.\n\n“It seems they are determined to get this one right,” Offut said. “They’ve been incredible in helping people get settled after this tragedy. They are helping with insurance claims, walking people through that process to make sure all forms are complete, all processes are done correctly. They’re helping with contacting the right people and just settling people down because they’ve lost so much and it’s so overwhelming.”\n\nMroczek said he has been in hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico, wildfires in Montana and an earthquake in California. “I hope these natural disasters aren’t following me,” he joked.\n\nBut in the aftermath of each case, he did not have to work with FEMA; only insurance companies.\n\nMroczek said FEMA’s response in Kerrville has been so strong that he “can’t even describe how helpful they are,” he said. “They’ll rearrange your phone, if you’re old and not very tech savvy. They will stay with you for hours until you understand what can happen and what they can do. They give you the websites and they lead you off to the right agency to help with your concerns.”\n\nPublic perception of FEMA is sometimes fueled by a misunderstanding of what it does, Criswell said. Lorena Guillen, owner of Blue Oak RV Park and Howdy’s restaurant in Kerrville, for example, was expecting FEMA to aid in the recovery of her businesses. All 28 motor homes on her property were washed away in the floods and her restaurant next door suffered severe damage. The land could not be insured against damage from a flood, she said.\n\nHowever, FEMA typically does not provide businesses with cash but guidance and other resources. In this case, itdirected her to the Small Business Administration, which Guillen said could supply her with a loan.\n\n“How the heck am I going to get a freaking loan that I have to pay back on top of my mortgage?” she said. “My business is gone. It’s going to take about a year to get it up and running again.”\n\nHer restaurant suffered damages from the flooding, including “holes the size of buses in the walls,” and electricity and plumbing outages that Guillen has paid to fix. She was astounded to learn FEMA does not help small businesses with financial assistance.\n\n“But what about us?” said Guillen, whose restaurant employs 16 workers. “We bring in the tourists. We hire local residents. Many, many, many businesses are in the same boat. So to get nothing from FEMA? Crazy.”\n\nFollowing disasters, FEMA becomes “a reimbursement agency,” Criswell said. States and local governments spearhead rebuilding and FEMA reimburses them for rebuilding damaged infrastructure that everyday people deal with. On top of that, individuals can also ask for assistance, which pays for things like a place to stay.\n\nAfter a few days, the “waist high” water that infiltrated Gloria’s home receded, he said, leaving a filthy collection of mud and water under his 11-year-old daughter’s bedroom.\n\n“You walk into my house and you smell some dirty river water that we’re just living on top of,” he said.\n\nLike most residents in Kerrville, he did not have flood insurance on his home. And he is desperate to have the potentially hazardous “gunk” removed from beneath his daughter’s bedroom. At the end of last week, FEMA said he would receive $6,719 toward home repairs, which have been estimated to cost $50,000, he said.\n\nHe called the FEMA support of his home “a joke.”\n\nGloria said he’s applied for five different types of aid, but has been frustrated by the bureaucracy and red tape he’s encountered every step of the way.\n\nCriswell, though, said FEMA is set up this way for a reason.\n\n“There are checks and balances, and so people get kind of frustrated with the type of documentation that FEMA might ask for to prove occupancy or to prove home ownership, or the types of losses,” Criswell said.\n\nThe overall losses and the back-and-forth with FEMA have taken a toll on Gloria, he said. “I fall into depression, so I keep working because if I sit still, I have to look at the flood damages,” Gloria said. “And I don’t know when it will ever get back to normal — or if FEMA will help me get back to normal.”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_title":"Five incredible new World Heritage Sites everyone should visit",
    "News_text":"There are various obvious clues that summer has arrived in full: the end of the school year; the inevitable travel chaos at our main airports; traffic jams on the way toCornwall.\n\nBut one of the more high-brow indicators is the revelation of the latest list ofUnesco World Heritage Sites. This generally arrives in July, as the UN’s cultural arm gives its official rubber-stamp to locations “around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity”.\n\nAs of this year, this amounts to 1,248 significant places in 170 countries – ranging from palaces in France to coral harbours in Micronesia.\n\nThe newest announcement, made this week, has added a further 26 “inscribed properties” to this gleaming portfolio – some of them in relatively remote corners of the planet such as Tajikistan and Malawi, others closer to hand in Italy, Greece andGermany.\n\nThe following fresh inductees are all worth at least a long weekend:\n\nThe preposterous idea that German architecture is dour and lifeless is rebutted with the firmest flourish by the castles that were strewn across the hillsides and high places of Bavaria by its monarch, Ludwig II, between 1864 and 1886.\n\nA man of flamboyant tastes, Ludwig commissioned three separate country properties – Neuschwanstein, Linderhof, Herrenchiemsee – during his 22-year reign, envisaging each of them as a refuge from the apparent mundanity of court life in Munich.\n\nAll three of them (plus a villa on Schachen hill, near Garmisch-Partenkirchen) are part of the new Unesco listing – although it is Neuschwanstein, with its dreaming spires, which has become the region’s postcard icon.\n\n“Drawing inspiration from Versailles, German fairy tales and Wagner’s operas, the palaces showcase historicist styles and advanced 19th century techniques. Carefully integrated into stunning landscapes, they embody Ludwig’s artistic vision.”\n\nNeuschwanstein Castle is one of the highlights of the 12-day Fairytale Bavaria & Three Rivers Cruise offered byGreat Rail Journeys(01904 734 152). From £3,399 per person, including return train travel in and out of London.\n\nOf all the tales to emerge from Ancient Greece, the story of Theseus stalking and slaying the bull-headed Minotaur in a labyrinth is perhaps the most fantastical. But there is solid matter behind the myth. Knossos, the supposed site of this magical maze, was very real.\n\nThe city’s foundations still exist outside Heraklion, the modern capital ofCrete– baking in the sun as an echo of the Minoan civilisation which held court on the island from 3100 to 1100BC. Knossos is one of six Cretan archaeological sites to receive the Unesco seal of approval this year; the ruins of Zakra, Phaistos, Kydonia, Zominthos and Malia are the others. All of them offer good reason to climb off your lounger during a summer holiday.\n\n“The sites represent the Minoan civilisation. They served as administrative, economic and religious hubs, featuring advanced architecture, urban planning and vibrant frescoes. They reveal early writing systems, maritime networks, and cultural exchanges.”\n\nMartin Randall Travel(020 3936 0353) runs a nine-day escorted tour of the island – Minoan Crete: History & Archaeology – which peers at this era in depth. Next departure March 27 (2026). From £3,510 per person, flights extra.\n\nAlmost every year, one of the new Unesco locations is so special that you cannot believe it has not been part of the club for decades. The standing stones of Carnac are the 2025 example – 3,000 slabs of hand-hewn granite that were put in position, near the south-west coast of what is now theBrittanypeninsula, in about 3300BC (though some may date to 4500BC).\n\nMany of the megaliths had clear purposes – laid out to createdolmens(tombs) andtumuli(burial mounds). In this, they are perhaps better understood than Stonehenge, which, built in around 3100BC, they pre-date – but they share its air of Neolithic mystery.\n\nThese monumental stone constructions – arranged in relation to one another, and to features like terrain and waterways – reflect a sophisticated understanding of their environment. Rich engravings and other assorted artefacts further illustrate the cultural complexity of the societies that inhabited this part of the European Atlantic coast.\n\nAndante Travels(01722 466 243) offers Brittany: Carnac and Beyond; a seven-day escorted tour of the region. Two departures are still in the diary for this year (September 1; September 7), from £3,790 a head (including trains).\n\nNot every new Unesco site is a tribute to humanity’s best instincts. The arrival on the heritage list of the key places associated with the Khmer Rouge – the brutal regime which tortured and killed around two million people during a reign of terror over Cambodia that endured from 1975 to 1979 – is stark proof.\n\nTwo of these vicious hellholes – Tuol Sleng and Choeung Ek – are in the capital Phnom Penh. While now devoted to remembrance, they do not hide the brutality of what they witnessed half a century ago. Visitors do not step out of them in a bright frame of mind, but the story they tell should not be ignored.\n\nThe three component parts represent the widespread violence during this period – the former M-13 prison (early repression), the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (former S-21 prison) and the Choeung Ek Genocidal Center (former execution site of S-21). These places have been preserved, and memorialised, since the regime’s fall.\n\nInside Asia Tours(0117 409 0270) sells a 12-day itinerary, Into the Heart of Cambodia, which looks at the country’s darkest hours in Phnom Penh, and its most remarkable at Angkor Wat. From £2,340 a head (flights extra).\n\nIt is quite the achievement to be remembered as “the wickedest city on Earth” more than three centuries after effectively ceasing to exist.

    "News_title":"Eaton fire could wipe out California's $21-billion wildfire fund, documents show",
    "News_text":"Damage claims from the Eaton wildfire in Altadena could wipe out the $21-billion fund California created to shield utilities and their customers from the cost of wildfires sparked by electric lines, according to newly released state documents.\n\nInvestigators are seeking to determine whether Southern California Edison's equipment sparked the Jan. 7 inferno, which killed 19 people and destroyed 9,000 homes. If Edison is found responsible, “the resulting claims may be substantial enough to fully exhaust the Fund,” state officials who administer the wildfire fund wrote in a draft annual report to the Legislature.\n\nThe seven-member state Catastrophe Response Council, which oversees the fund, is scheduled to meet Thursday to discuss how potential damage claims from the Eaton fire could affect it.\n\nConcerns are already emerging that, should Edison be found liable, it would have little incentive to keep damage claims from becoming excessive since the utility itself would be spared from covering most of the costs.\n\n“Are we impressing on the utilities that they need to settle claims with diligence?” wrote one of the council members, according to meeting materials released ahead of Thursday's meeting. “Since the claims they settle are just passed on to us, they don’t have much incentive to keep claims low.”\n\nAsked for comment on that statement, Edison spokeswoman Kathleen Dunleavy said that officials \"need to be wise and cautious about how this money is spent.\"\n\n\"We agree that the wildfire fund should go to those directly affected by wildfires,\" she said.\n\nThe council member who raised the concern wasn't identified by name.\n\nWade Crowfoot, California’s secretary of Natural Resources, holds one of the nine council seats. His spokesman, Tony Andersen, said Crowfoot is \"engaged very closely\" on the wildfire fund issue, but had no additional comment at this time.\n\nOther council members include Gov. Gavin Newsom, other state leaders and their appointees.\n\nAccording to the state documents, the insured property losses alone could amount to as much as $15.2 billion, according to materials released ahead of a Thursday meeting.\n\nThat amount does not include uninsured losses or damages beyond those to property, such as wrongful-death claims. An earlier study by UCLA estimated losses from the fire at $24 billion to $45 billion.\n\nNewsom and legislative leaders are now talking about how to shore up the fund. TheTimes reportedlast month that one option under discussion behind closed doors is to have electricity customers pay billions of dollars more into the fund.\n\nNewsom and lawmakers created the wildfire fund in 2019, saying it was needed to protect the state’s three biggest for-profit utilities from bankruptcy if their equipment sparked a catastrophic fire.Newsom saidat the time that the legislation, known as Assembly Bill 1054, would “move our state toward a safer, affordable and reliable energy future.”\n\nSix years later, however, utilities’ electricity lines continue to be a top cause of wildfires in California. And in 2024, the state had thesecond highestelectric rates in the country after Hawaii.\n\nEdisonsaid in Aprilthat a leading theory of the cause of the Eaton fire is that one of its decades-old transmission lines, last used in 1971, somehow became reenergized and sparked the fire. The investigation into the cause of the fire is continuing.\n\nAlready lawyers have filed dozens of lawsuits against Edison on behalf of families who lost their homes, nearby residents who say they were harmed by toxins in the smoke and governments that lost buildings and equipment.\n\nUnder the 2019 law, Edison would be allowed to settle those lawsuits. Then the state fund would reimburse the company for all or most of those costs.\n\nThe Palisades fire, which also ignited Jan. 7, isn't covered by the wildfire fund because Pacific Palisades is served by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, a municipal utility.\n\nNewsom's staff didn't respond to questions about how the fund's life could be extended and whether he believed AB 1054 should be amended so that excessive settlements or attorney fees aren't allowed to deplete the fund.\n\nOne idea being debated is to have the 30 million Californians served by Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, and San Diego Gas & Electric pay billions of dollars more into the fund. That plan could involve extending a monthly surcharge of about $3 on electricity bills beyond its planned expiration in 2035.\n\nOfficials at the California Earthquake Authority, which serves as administrator of the wildfire fund, say they are also worried that attorney fees could eat up a large portion of the money.\n\nAttorneys can receive 30% to 40% of the victim settlements, according toa 2024 study. An additional 10% to 15% can go to lawyers defending the utility from fire claims, the study said. That means as much as 50% of settlement amounts could go to legal fees, the paper said.\n\nThe consolidated lawsuit against Edison in Los Angeles County Superior Court lists more than 50 law firms involved in the litigation.\n\nOfficials at the Earthquake Authority say the Legislature may have to change the 2019 law to limit attorney fees or give priority to some settlements over others.\n\nFor example, Wall Street hedge funds have been offering to buy claims that insurance companies have against Edison. Thefunds are gamblingthat they can get more from the state’s wildfire fund in the future than they are paying insurers for the claims now.\n\nCouncil members discussed in May whether AB 1054 should be amended so that claims from Californians who lost their homes be given precedence over those owned by Wall Street investors trying to profit from the fire.\n\nThis story originally appeared inLos Angeles Times.",

    "News_title":"How AI helps solve a big problem with small earthquakes in Yellowstone",
    "News_text":"Yellowstone earthquakes that occurred during 2010-2019. Blue symbols indicate events that occurred as part of swarms, while red indicates non-swarm seismicity. Map courtesy of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations. (Public domain, USGS)\n\nAlthough they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region.\n\nUsingconventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refineearthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.\n\nEarthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stationsoperates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when: 1) there are not enough measurements; or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem duringswarms of small earthquakesbecause the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after theylocate the earthquake, but not always. About 2% of the earthquakes in the University of Utah Seismograph Stations catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99.\n\nTo solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!\n\nMost people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples—sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.\n\nThere is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In arecent study, University of Utah scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.\n\nIn the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal—such as the amplitude—and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are as many as four times the measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.\n\nThe new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, seismic station scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.\n\nThese machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches.\n\nYellowstone Caldera Chronicles is a weekly column written by scientists and collaborators of the YellowstoneVolcanoObservatory. This week’s contribution is from Alysha Armstrong, graduate student at the University of Utah Department of Geology and Geophysics.",

    "News_text":"Seeking to avoid lengthy litigation, Southern California Edison said Wednesday it will offer to compensate Eaton fire victims directly for damages suffered, even though it has yet to formally concede that its equipment ignited the blaze on Jan. 7.\n\nEdison said it planned to launch a Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program this fall that would be open to those who lost homes, businesses or rental properties in the fire that killed 19 people and destroyed more than 9,400 homes and other structures in Altadena. It would also cover those who were harmed by smoke, suffered physical injuries or had family members who died.\n\n“Even though the details of how the Eaton Fire started are still being evaluated, SCE will offer an expedited process to pay and resolve claims fairly and promptly,” Pedro Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, the utility’s parent company, said in a press release. “This allows the community to focus more on recovery instead of lengthy, expensive litigation.”\n\nThe utility said it had hired consultants Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros, who had worked on the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, to help design the program.\n\nDozens of lawsuits have been filed against Edison in the wake of the Jan. 7 fire that videos captured igniting under a transmission line in Eaton Canyon. The cause is still under investigation, but Pizarro has said a leading theory is that an idle Edison transmission line, last used in 1971, somehow became reenergized and started the blaze.\n\nAn attorney who represents fire victims expressed skepticism of the plan, saying it could lead to reduced compensation for fire victims.\n\n“In the past, the utilities have proposed these programs as a means for shorting and underpaying victims,” said attorney Richard Bridgford. “Victims have uniformly done better when represented by counsel.\"\n\nEdison said the program would be designed to quickly compensate victims, including those who were insured. People can apply with or without an attorney, it said. The program is expected to run through 2026.\n\n“The architecture and timing of the SCE direct claims program will be instrumental in efficiently managing funding resources, mitigating interest costs and minimizing inflationary pressures so funds can address actual claims and fairly compensate community members for their losses,” Pizarro said.\n\nIf Edison is found responsible for the fire, the state’s $21-billion wildfire fund is expected to reimburse the company for all or most of the payments it makes to victims. Brigford said he believed the wildfire fund would be enough to cover the Eaton fire claims.\n\n“They are trying to make people panic so they don’t get adequate representation,” he said.\n\nOthers are concerned that the state wildfire fund is inadequate. Officials at the Earthquake Authority, which administers the wildfire fund, said in documents released in advance of a Thursday meeting that they fear the costs of the Eaton firecould exhaust the fund.\n\nState officials plan to discuss what can be done to lengthen the life of the fund at the meeting.\n\nEdison said more information on eligibility and other details of the compensation plan would be released in the coming weeks.\n\nThis story originally appeared inLos Angeles Times.",

    "News_text":"Sign up for the Slatestto get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nJuly has been a month of floods. First came the July 4 deluge in the Texas Hill Country, which killed 135 people. Deadly flooding in New Mexico followed the next week. Then a record day of rain pummeled New York City, killing two people in New Jersey and sending waterfalls into the subway system.\n\nMore extreme rainfall is a well-documented consequence of climate change, because a hotter atmosphere holds more moisture. With 3,600 flash-flood warnings in 2025 and the year barely half over, the National Weather Service islikely to passits annual average of 4,000 warnings before long. And yet Americans remain ambivalent about the growing risk of floods.\n\nThis spring, the “Climate Change in the American Mind” survey from researchers at Yale and George Mason University showed that large majorities of Americans believe rising carbon dioxide levels are affecting a variety of environmental problems, especially extreme heat, droughts, wildfires, and flooding.\n\nBut when asked to describe their own personal exposure to those risks, Americans’ concern level drops substantially. In the case of flooding, just 28 percent of respondents were “very” or “moderately” worried about extreme weather–related flooding in their area, a lower score than any other surveyed event except “reduced snowpack.”\n\nThis reverse empathy gap shows up in data about other perceived social problems, such as crime, where respondents justify their media-experience dissonance by concluding that the consequences of an issue are borne primarily by other people.\n\nThe data helps illustrate why it has been so hard to adjust to our new and very rainy reality, an atmospheric shift toward heavier precipitation that threatensrural Texasand New York’s1 trainin equal measure. Rainfall flooding has become an increasingly serious problem, overwhelming social and physical infrastructure. It hasupended our sense of “climate havens,” as places like Madison, Wisconsin; Buffalo, New York; and rural Vermont have been swamped by unprecedented precipitation events in recent years. But if Americans aren’t worried about flash flooding, what’s going to keep us dry?\n\nRain may be a less intuitive consequence of global warming, suggested Jennifer Marlon, a scientist with Yale’s Program on Climate Change Communication, which conducts the survey. Unlike heat waves and melting ice caps, which are obvious consequences of a hotter planet, the new prevalence of extreme rainfall requires “another link in the causal chain,” she told me.\n\nIt can be hard to isolate the cost of rainfall flooding, since much flood damage falls under the umbrella of hurricanes, which have been by far the most expensive category of U.S. disaster over the past 30 years. But 54 percent of their fatalities since 2013 were caused by freshwater flooding, according to a Washington Post analysis—double the historical average of 27 percent.\n\nThePost’s investigation concerns Hurricane Helene, and contrasts the outcomes for coastal Florida counties with those of inland North Carolina, where the storm destroyed towns and killed over 100 people last year. Coastal areas were both better prepared and more sternly warned, even though the potential for deadly flooding inland was also forecast days in advance. In an analysis of cellphone data, the Post found a 36 percent spike in people leaving Florida counties in the run-up to landfall. In North Carolina, there was no meaningful movement at all.\n\nKeri Stephens, an expert in disaster communications at the University of Texas, said that rainfall flooding poses several special challenges. First, hurricanes aside, rainfall flooding is usually a “rapid-onset disaster” akin to an earthquake, where it’s hard to alert people in advance. The messaging problem begins in elementary school. There is no “Stop, drop, and roll” equivalent for a flooding event, she said, and her work shows that young people do not respond to “Turn around, don’t drown.” (The materialist “Keep your car high and dry” has more success.)\n\nAt the same time, she said, people who experience nonfatal flooding events and live with constant warnings start to view them as less serious. This process of “habituation” can undermine a good communication program. In Japan, which has a sophisticated flood warning system, residents accustomed to safety have begun toignore evacuation orders.\n\nRainfall is also hard to predict, which gives pause to officials who are wary of losing the trust of the public. After the deadly Fourth of July floods in Texas, for example, the Kerrville city managersaidthat authorities were reluctant to “cry wolf” and order evacuations.\n\nOne issue for both forecasters and local officials is the variability of extreme rainstorms: Unlike heat waves or storm surges, which tend to blanket the areas they hit, rainstorms can form “mosaics,” in which one neck of a valley or one neighborhood of a city may see much more rain than a neighboring area.\n\n“Specifically for precipitation, the effect of natural variability in the system is larger than the effect of climate change,” Iris de Vries, a researcher at MIT studying climate extremes, told me. These pockets of intense rainfall often take residents by surprise, even if they are part of a familiar-looking storm system. “Most disasters that could happen haven’t happened yet.”\n\nIn addition to putting record amounts of moisture into the atmosphere, which has induced more extreme rainstorms, climate change also makes these calamities harder to anticipate, explained Bernhard Rappenglueck, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Houston. That’s because weather systems appear to be slowing down. A fast-moving storm will drench a large area, but a slow-moving storm (like Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Houston in 2017) will bring outsize consequences wherever it decides to hover. That can “cause drastic changes of rainfall amounts over shorter distances,” Rappenglueck told me.\n\nWhat’s to be done? The obvious step is to adapt our infrastructure to accommodate new expectations of storms, whether through alert systems, storm sewers, floodwalls, or green infrastructure. But that takes money, and unfortunately, things are moving in the opposite direction, with the Trump administration clawing back money from studies on public transit resilience and anything else that mentions climate change. Or we could ask why, despite flooding’s intensity, unpredictability, and ubiquity, Americans seem unworried by the threat of rain. Perhaps it’s just harder to see than other disasters. Unlike the ocean, whose breakers instantly communicate danger, the culprit in a flooding event could be as unimposing as a tiny creek or a clogged storm drain. It doesn’t look like much until the water is at your door.",

But as a child, I remember it being a non-destination with a gritty exterior; a smoggy behemoth of urban sprawl that other Mexicans would joke about never wanting to visit. Still, the oldest and largest metropolis in North America—and a primary gateway intoLatin Americafor travelers worldwide—has always emitted a type of magic, with live folk bands roaming Plaza Garibaldi; the world's largest collection of Mesoamerican relics in the heart of Parque Chapultepec; and lard-rubbed Gaonera tacos slung from crammed streetside stalls. There's an unvarnished vibrancy of Mexican life, beside a swirling mix of global influences and ideas that have historically been embraced. Everything from the food to art of this metropolis has the fingerprint of immigrant communities who have arrived from overseas and within the country. But in recent years, the influx of Americans and Europeans specifically has reached a crescendo.\n\nNow, it seems the city has become too beloved for its own good.\n\nIn early July, hundreds of Mexican nationals took toMexico City’s streets to protest the current realities of a city that now seems to embrace foreigners at the cost of locals’ needs. The protests were concentrated in the upscale neighborhoods of Roma and Condesa, where the biggest cluster of international visitors and residents have flockedin record numbers since the pandemic, drawn by internationally acclaimed restaurants and bars, designer boutiques, and Instagram-friendly façades—and where the cost of living has risen exorbitantly in response. A number of interconnected factors can be blamed (Airbnb, digital nomads themselves, government policy), but demonstrators are clear that their way of living has been altered by this massive influx of people, and something has got to give.\n\nIn the past five years alone, the average rent costs around Cuauhtémoc, a desirable municipality that encompasses the trendiest zip codes, haveswelled by 30%. During that same window, the amount of US citizens who initiated or renewed their residency visas in Mexico Cityincreased by nearly 70%. Yet, as rent and property values have skyrocketed,wages have remained relatively stagnantand in some cases decreased for the Mexican workforce. Some estimates on the averageAmerican salaryplace it at between double and triple the averageMexico City salary. In neighborhoods like Condesa, rents in many apartment buildings are now reflective of what foreigners with higher salaries can afford, rather than what locals are able to pay in pesos. The effects on everyday Chilangos are devastating as the market adjusts to US dollars and euros, and businesses overly cater to the tourists who earn in those currencies.\n\nMany blame the government primarily for overreaching in its attempt to transform the city into a global hub. In 2016, El Distrito Federal de México (DF), as it was formerly known, was legislatively renamed as Ciudad de México (CDMX) to more closely resemble its English-sounding name, Mexico City. It signaled the early stages of a judicial overhaul to clean up the city’s image. The corporate-coded rebranding came packaged with a glossy paint job, in which the city’s taxis and public letterings were cast in bright pink as an effort to soften the city’s appearance for incoming visitors. (The color was selected based on study groups and theperception of safety).\n\nIn a capital known for its gastronomic wonders, restaurants have been a focal point. The city's hardest-to-get tables are often dominated by foreigners, some of whom make restaurant reservations at destination-worthy spots before even booking their flights there. It raises an even bigger question: Who are these restaurants for? At times, the city's beloved restaurants have served as harbingers of oncoming gentrification. In others, they’ve remained as symbols of an enduring past.\n\nSince opening in 2018,Masala y Maiz, named one of TIME’s Top 100 Greatest Places in the world, has tried to bridge those worlds. The restaurant is emblematic of Mexico City’s culinary wealth, and chef-owners Saqib Keval and Norma Listman present a fusion of East African, Mexican, and Indian dishes highlighting the Global South. Their approach is centered on not just cultural sustainability, but on community, fair wages, and workers' rights. Though they admittedly benefit from tourism, Keval and Listman are also impacted by a changing city, and adamantly in support of the protests.\n\n“This isn’t new,” Listman, who was raised in nearby Texcoco, points out. “These neighborhoods were gentrified by wealthy Mexicans before they were by Americans, Europeans, and Canadians. We have been hearing Americans with a lot of hurt feelings. It’s not against [them]—people are just fed up that they can’t live in this city anymore. We can’t afford to go out in this city.”\n\nCity and state officials, they say, have failed in upholding the proper measures for its residents. “This is against shitty government policy,” Keval says. “It’s similar to how gentrification, and government and city policy works everywhere. If you give tax breaks and construction benefits to absentee landlords to build low cost, this is what happens.”[Editor's note: The city office did not reply to the writer's request for a comment.]\n\nToday, when many Chilangos look around, they see swaths of out-of-towners taking up public spaces as if its their city, rather than a community in which they are interlopers. English is everywhere, in the air and on menus. Near Parque Mexico, it's now common for locals to find themselves dodging foreigners who are running with dogs or jogging with strollers, both things that would feel completely out of place in most other parts of Mexico, where the sidewalks are narrow—and public spaces are more often used for gathering or resting rather than working out.\n\nPaul Lara, a financial reporter from Mexico City who lives in Condesa and has written about the ramifications ofAirbnb-impacted gentrificationin his neighborhood, is himself in the process of being evicted from the apartment he has lived in for over 15 years. After the death of the building’s longtime owner, whom Lara had established a familial-like relationship with, the owner’s son took charge and announced he would be flipping the property into an Airbnb or co-working space. Lara’s teenage daughter attends a school within walking distance of their apartment, and the unbeatable access to public transportation is crucial for his own working needs, but now Lara and his family must relocate.\n\n“It’s a theme of classism, that only certain people with certain amounts of incomes can live here. It’s not a level playing field for me to compete against a US worker,” says Lara. “They are pushing out people like me, small business owners, longtime residents. The social fabric of the place starts to deteriorate over time.” Before the pandemic, Lara enjoyed flourishing mechanic shops, tortillerias, and carnicerias around his home, communal spaces where residents could conveniently load up on fresh, handmade tortillas or different types of meats while catching up with neighbors and food vendors. In many cases, neighbors would simply hang out around these businesses to pass time. According to him, most of these familiar neighborhood charms and ways of life have faded as old neighbors are pushed further away from their social networks as they are forced to leave the places they have long called home, due to rising costs of living. \"Many can’t pay the rent because the economy of this neighborhood isn't for them anymore,\" he says.\n\nLara is painfully aware of how his own displacement will also lead to the rippled expulsion of whoever he pushes out in whatever neighborhood he unwillingly lands in next: “It’s not just foreigners; it’s also Mexicans who can gentrify.”\n\nLara points to the earthquake of 2017 as the catalyst for the massive real estate sweep in the city. After many buildings were damaged,some residents we forced to temporarily move out, only to return to higher rent prices. Then during the pandemic, apartments were further vacated and subsequently repriced as residents relocated to the city’s peripheral neighborhoods. Shortly after, in 2022, then-mayor of Mexico City and current Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaumincentivized global online workersto move to the metropolis by announcing a formal partnership with UNESCO and Airbnb. At the time, Tourism Secretary Nathalie Desplas believed the deal would generate $3.72 billion in revenue for the city. But the decision has backfired against longtime community members.\n\nFor anyone who has spent time in the Mexican capital since the pandemic, this is not a new conversation: Messages calling out gringos and gentrification have spread through guerilla-style posters, tagged signposts, and full blown murals. There have been reported cases of taquerias making their salsas less spicy (“even the salsas have been gentrified”); traditional establishments like pulquerias, which serve a traditional alcoholic drink made from fermented maguey sap in humble establishments, are a less common sight.Businesses that have been open for over half a century are suddenly shutting down, with online commenters photoshopping the images of Starbucks onto the empty facades.\n\n“This isn’t racism or xenophobia. Many [foreigners] have been here for a long time from other countries. Mexicans are welcoming,” Lara says, referring to the reported1.2 million immigrants who reside in Mexico. “But the march was important. It was an assembly, a reunion of people who once lived here or want to remain living here.”\n\nFor foreigners who have moved to the city, it's an uncomfortable time. Some feel they've done everything “the right way” and yet they now live in neighborhoods tagged with slogans like “Fuera Gringo” (get out, gringo). They too say city officials are to blame.\n\n“[President] Claudia Sheinbam signed the agreement with Airbnb that has dramatically increased prices in Mexico City,” says Ari Levy, a US citizen who relocated to Condesa fromChicagoas a remote worker in 2022. Levy hasstudied Spanishfor 10 years, and has worked for Mexican companies in Mexico City. He feels he does his part to integrate into Mexican society as much as possible. After nearly three years in the country, Levy is close to attaining his permanent residency. Although he understands the frustration, he points his finger at the property owners and the government, who try to take advantage of foreigners by overcharging them and frequently disregard their own rules.\n\n“Mexican immigration is probably some of the easiest in the world,” he says. “If you overstay your visa there really isn’t any penalty. You might get deported. I know people who have done that, left, and came right back.”\n\nIt's a timely thorn in the current situation: As US citizens move into Mexico without properly following immigration protocols, often using loopholes in visa policies to prolong their stay or work remote in the Mexican capital, the Trump administration has ramped up itsdeportation effortsfrom the US, significantly impacting Mexicans in American cities.\n\nIt doesn't help that, for every diligent newcomer who respects the culture and language, there are plenty of “expats” who are oblivious to this privilege gap. Online, you'll find countless videos with titles like “Excellent Place for Digital Nomads… Houses for Rent in Mexico City” or “Quick & Dirty Digital Nomad Guide to Mexico City,” a majority of which compare the low costs of living to remarkably expensive cities like New York.\n\n“Mexico City [in the past was] more accessible for Mexicans who work Mexican jobs and make Mexican pesos,” says Sandra Blow, a photographer originally from Atizapán who has lived in Mexico City for over a decade and participated in the protests. “But from the moment that we started getting charged as if we’re all making dollars, everything went to shit.”\n\nThe power dynamic is lopsided, which is fueling the anger many locals are feeling. “Mexicans don’t have the opportunity or ability to do the same in the US, or anywhere else in the world,” says Blow of remote workers and expats. “We can’t just go invest in properties or build a business in the US or somewhere outside of Mexico. Maybe the richest Mexicans can, but for the average worker here, that’s not a possibility. But there are plenty of Americans who are middle class who can just come to Mexico and do that, and completely change their lives and live off of Mexicans, all while leaving a country that disparages Mexican workers.”\n\nThough cross-border tensions play a unique role in the situation, the challenges facing Mexico City may feel familiar to other over-loved destinations. As a former resident of theSan Francisco Bay Area, I experienced the loss of culture fueled by the influx of tech money and the ways in which the city bent over itself to adapt to it. Widespread protests in cities like Barcelona and Venice have also given an outlet to residents who have begun to feel like second-class citizens in their own cities due to the outsize presence of Airbnb and large numbers of foreign visitors and residents (in Spain, protesters took matters into their own hands bywalking around with water guns aimed at non-locals). But there's a unique interplay between Mexico and the US—the vast differences in income and privilege, and yet the close physical proximity.\n\nIn many cases,a tourism-based economy is beneficialto Mexico’s profit gains. But that system has been aggressively exploited. (One international tax website says atop its page: “Mexico is a top destination for US expats looking for an affordable and vibrant lifestyle abroad. One of the most significant advantages of living in Mexico as a US expat is the low cost of living.”) And it's all changing the city that people came for. “It’s a simple view to say ‘just go live somewhere else if you can't afford it,” says Lara. “But it’s a loss of a friend, a family member. It changes social patterns.”\n\nWith more marches scheduled, Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada hasannounced a planto address the widespread concerns around gentrification. Brugada’s outline includes a $31.8 million investment in public housing, and a proposal to build and renovate 20,000 new rental units that will allegedly prioritize the city’s most at-risk populations. The initiative is arriving at a crucial moment, when the city’s social fabric is unraveling after years of city and federal mismanagement and neglect. Though it’s a start, local experts are wary of how it will be regulated and enforced.\n\n“A lot of people who have hurt feelings, specifically in the US, wouldn’t have those hurt feelings if these protests were happening in their community,” says Keval, an Indian-American who arrived in Mexico City from Oakland in 2016. “It’s justified to put pressure on oppressive systems and governments. Some people left the US because they got priced out, and then they came here and didn’t do a power analysis of the power we bring. The privileges of class, mobility. My passport carries weight. That all needs to be taken into account in this conversation.”\n\nOriginally Appeared onCondé Nast Traveler\n\nThe Latest Stories from Condé Nast Traveler\n\nWant to be the first to know?Sign up to our newslettersfor travel inspiration and tips\n\n45Abandoned PlacesAround the World That You Can Visit\n\nTheCheapest Nicest Hotels in Paris\n\nTheWomen Who Travel Power List 2025",

    "News_title":"Trump tells Israel to ‘finish the job’ against Hamas weeks after suggesting ceasefire deal in sight",
    "News_text":"Only a few weeks ago,President Donald Trumpseemed confident a deal was days away that would endthe fighting in Gaza, secure the release of hostages and allow aid to flow into an enclave where people are starving to death.\n\nNow, Trump’s optimism seems to have vanished. The president pulled back his negotiators from ceasefire talks this week after the US deemed Hamas neither “coordinated” nor “acting in good faith.” Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, said he was looking into “alternative options” for getting the hostages out.\n\nAnd Trump, rather than urging an immediate return to the negotiating table, signaled Friday it was time for Israel to escalate its military campaign, even as images of starving children in Gaza lead to mounting global outrage.\n\n“I think they want to die, and it’s very, very bad,” Trump said of Hamas before leaving for a weekend trip to Scotland. “It got to be to a point where you’re gonna have to finish the job.”\n\nWhether Trump’s shift in posture is a true reflection of the talks breaking down — or, as some Western officials suggested, a tactical step meant to jolt Hamas and break a deadlock — wasn’t clear.\n\nBut his words suggested he would do little to pressure Israel to pull back on its 21-month-long military campaign in Gaza, despite a growing humanitarian crisis that led one UN official this week to label Gazans “walking corpses.”\n\nTrump declined to describe his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — whose actions in Gaza and Syria this month havesurprised and frustrated him— beyond calling them “sort of disappointing.”\n\n“They’re gonna have to fight and they’re gonna have to clean it up. You’re gonna have to get rid of ‘em,” Trump said of Israel going after Hamas.\n\nIt was a stark acknowledgement from the president that his attempts to broker a new ceasefire — which seemed earlier this month in its final stages — had fallen off course. A failure to end the Gaza conflict, along with his parallel struggles to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, have proven frustrating for Trump as he jockeys for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHis pessimism did not entirely match other signals emerging from the region. Egypt and Qatar said they would move forward in mediating for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, calling the latest suspension in talks “normal in the context of these complex negotiations,” according to a joint statement posted by theEgyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nA senior Israeli official told CNN that the talks have “not at all” collapsed, and said there is still an opportunity for the negotiations to resume.\n\nAnd some US officials said they hoped both the president’s comments Friday, paired with the decision by Witkoff on Thursday to pull back from the ceasefire talks, would push Hamas into a more conciliatory negotiating stance.\n\nStill, the United States’ sudden pull back sent shockwaves Thursday night through Doha, the Qatari capital where the negotiations have been taking place.\n\n“This is an earthquake,” said one source with direct knowledge of the talks. “We’re dealing with the aftershock.”\n\nAs has been the case for months, the sticking points in the talks include how and when the war will end permanently, the number of Palestinian prisoners who will be released and where the Israeli military will redeploy in Gaza, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday on the South Lawn as his helicopter awaited, Trump blamed the breakdown in talks squarely on Hamas, which he said had seen its leverage diminished after dozens of its hostages were either released or died in custody.\n\n“Now we’re down to the final hostages, and they know what happens after you get the final hostages, and basically, because of that, they really didn’t want to make a deal,” Trump said, echoing a sentiment that one US official said Netanyahu conveyed when he met with Trump for dinner at the White House earlier this month.\n\nWhether Trump’s comments will actually pressure Hamas into agreeing to the existing proposal to end the war remains to be seen, but they did appear designed in part to try to jog Hamas back to the realm of what is achievable.\n\nIn the wake of Witkoff’s Thursday statement, the senior Israeli official said Israel hopes Hamas will “reconnect itself to reality” so the remaining gaps can be bridged.\n\nSpeaking to CNN on Friday, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce predicted Trump and Witkoff’s efforts would eventually yield results, though she declined to indicate what direction the talks would head next.\n\n“We’ve tried. The world has watched this. What the options are — clearly there are many tools in President Trump’s tool chest, many options that Special Envoy Witkoff has,” Bruce told Kate Bolduan. “So, they are very smart, adept individuals who know the players. And I expect that we’ll have some success.”\n\nNeither Bruce, nor Trump, nor any other administration official seemed willing to place a timeline on when that success might come, perhaps wary after Trump predicted in early July that a deal would be struck within a week.\n\nBut as the starvation crisis in Gaza spirals into a humanitarian catastrophe, urgency is growing to complete a deal. During a meeting in Tunis on Friday, Tunisian President Kais Saied presented Trump’s senior Africa adviser Massad Boulos — who is also the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany — with photos of malnourished children, desperate for food and eating sand.\n\n“It is absolutely unacceptable,” Saied could be heard saying, according to AFP. “It is a crime against all of humanity.”\n\nAt the White House, Trump said it was Hamas that was preventing aid from being distributed. And he said the US hadn’t received enough credit for the help it had already provided.\n\n“People don’t know this, and we didn’t certainly get any acknowledgement or thank you, but we contributed $60 million to food and supplies and everything else,” he said. “We hope the money gets there, because you know, that money gets taken. The food gets taken. We’re going to do more, but we gave a lot of money.”\n\nAn internal US governmentreviewfound no evidence of widespread theft by Hamas of US-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, top US allies have adopted a tougher stance on Israel’s military campaign. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whom Trump will meet in Scotland this weekend, on Friday said “Israel’s disproportionate military escalation in Gaza” was “indefensible.”\n\nAnd French President Emmanuel Macron, in a surprise late night social media post, said France would move to recognize a Palestinian state at September’s United Nations General Assembly, a step that angered Israel and that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called “a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th.”\n\nTrump sounded less troubled by the move, which he instead dismissed as pointless.\n\n“The statement doesn’t carry any weight,” he said. “He’s a very good guy. I like him. But that statement doesn’t carry weight.”\n\nCNN’s Jeremy Diamond and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this story.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Sean Penn Reveals Why He Feels Like a “Plumber” at 2025 THR Social Impact Summit: “Tell Me What’s Broken and We’ll See If I Can Help Fix It”",
    "News_text":"Hundreds of guests gathered at the Directors Guild of America headquarters in Los Angeles on Thursday to participate in the 2025 Social Impact Summit: Philanthropy, Power and Purpose. Sean Penn, John Legend and George Lopez were among the speakers and honorees.\n\nThe summit brings together the worlds of philanthropy and Hollywood to discuss ideas and recognize changemakers who create a meaningful impact on the world.The Hollywood Reporterand the Social Impact Fund hosted the event.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nMore Than Cosplay: 'Ghostbusters' Fans Answer the Call to Do Good\n\nHollywood Flashback: When Paul Newman Made Doing Good Delicious\n\nSix Months After the L.A. Wildfires, Here's Who's Still Picking Up the Pieces\n\nWhile the panels covered a range of issues, from maternal health to rights for people with disabilities, the current political situation was never far from anyone’s mind, although Lopez did try to bring some levity to the situation with hiskeynote address.\n\n“People are OK with the detention center in Florida that they call Alligator Alcatraz. I think that’s heartbreaking,” he said, before joking, “but I also think as a Latino that the fences are there more to protect the alligators because as a Latino, if you let them loose, those alligators will be shoes and belts in an hour.”\n\nHe also spoke about the ICE raids that are sowing fear in immigrant communities across the country.\n\n“The terror is real. Everything they’re going through, they’ll remember for the rest of their lives,” Lopez said. “And when you’re a kid being separated from your family, the only thing you should be afraid of is the dark. They’re going to traumatize these people forever, for no other reason than for looking like me. The only crime that those people have committed is to do so much for so little money.”\n\nOlympic gold medalist Allyson Felix spoke on the panel “Who Runs the World? Trailblazers in Women’s Health and Wellness,” which explored wellness, mental health, sexual health and Black maternal health.\n\nShe detailed the challenges she faced during the birth of her child and how that helped her learn more about maternal mortality in the U.S.\n\n“I gave birth to my daughter two months early, and she spent a month in the NICU, and I had a severe case of preeclampsia. I had no idea about the crisis that we were facing in America and what was going on,” she said. “And when I was doing my research, I saw that it did not discriminate. It didn’t matter that I was an Olympian. It didn’t matter that I was in the best shape of my life. I still found myself in a hospital fighting for my life and my child fighting for hers. And I think that that just shows what a huge issue this is.”\n\nLegend was honored with thePhilanthropist of the Year awardfor his work to advance equity and criminal justice reform.\n\nDuring his speech, Legend also referenced the current political climate, criticizing the Trump administration for its immigration policies.\n\n“Our government is kidnapping and disappearing our friends and neighbors — our kids’ caregivers in the park — and then occupying our streets to silence the voices of those exercising their constitutional rights (and responsibilities, I might add) to dissent,”Legend said in part. “Our government is stealing from the poorest children in our communities … to line the pockets of the wealthiest. Day after day, our government is abandoning the shared values that have inspired us to become our best: To serve as a beacon for the world, to serve as the hope of the tired, of the tempest-tossed, of all who yearn to breathe free. To say nothing of the corruption and the cruelty and the malice and the seeming impunity. And the arsonists, the ones who ignite and stoke this destructive fire, are the ones we elected. The ones who swore to protect this house, to defend its people, its constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nIn his acceptance speech, he spoke about how his family motivated him to keep fighting for justice.\n\n“Redemption is possible; it’s not inevitable, but it is possible with grace. I see my family: Chrissy, Luna, Miles, Esti, Wren — the names that fill my life with faith, hope and love. The Bible says the greatest of these is love. Love has to power everything we do. Everything we fight for and seeing and loving my babies reminds me why I keep fighting for their future, our future.”\n\nFollowing his speech, Legend’s foundation was awarded $25,000 by Craig Cichy, executive director of the Social Impact Fund.\n\nLabor organizing legend Dolores Huerta participated in the panel “Protect the Block: Safeguarding Communities.” She addressed what she saw as the troubled state of America’s democracy and spoke to the direct action she felt citizens must take to protect their freedom.\n\n“All of us becoming organizers and messengers, we can take that responsibility and be very vocal and start spreading messages of support that people need,” Huerta said. “We can really save our democracy because we are in a really crucial moment, a critical moment. We’re losing our democracy. Make sure that the people that we know, our family, our neighbors, our organizations, that everybody is involved. We need everyone.”\n\nFollowing the panel, she led the audience in a call-and-response session that ended with the crowd chanting, “Si, se puede.”\n\nThe program ended with CORE co-founders Penn and Ann Leereceiving the honorfor Philanthropic Organization of the Year.\n\nPenn shared his philosophy, which drove his desire to help in regions ranging from Haiti after the island’s devastating 2010 earthquake to his current workrebuilding Los Angelesfollowing the Palisades and Eaton fires.\n\n“I think often about the people who work with us, and they’re humanitarians,” he said. “I feel much more like a plumber. I don’t really want to talk to babies or sick children or their parents, just tell me what’s broken and we’ll see if I can help fix it.”\n\nHe was also candid about what his organization needed to continue thriving in the future, particularlyin light of recent federal government funding cuts.\n\n“We God damn well need money. And then if you want to volunteer or offer a skill set of support in some other way to us, we’ll God damn well take that,” he said. “When we get money, and I think it’s our strength, I think we’re really good at casting from those communities, people who are leaders already or can be built into leaders. We spend money, I think, very well.”\n\nIn addition to presenting sponsor Gilead, the event was sponsored by Public Interest Registry, Heineken, Open Water and Bulleit Frontier Whiskey.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter\n\nSeeing Double? 25 Pairs of Celebrities Who Look Nearly Identical\n\nFrom 'Lady in the Lake' to 'It Ends With Us': 29 New and Upcoming Book Adaptations in 2024\n\nMeet the Superstars Who Glam Up Hollywood’s A-List\n\nSign up forTHR's Newsletter.

    "News_title":"Sir David Nabarro, physician who led the UN response to ebola and was the WHO’s envoy for Covid-19",
    "News_text":"Sir David Nabarro, who has died aged 75, was a British physician who led the world’s response to some of the most serious health crises of recent years, including ebola and Covid.\n\nDuring 17 years spent with the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organisation (WHO), Nabarro took on matters of food security and nutrition, malaria, Aids, avian and human flu and climate change.\n\nIn addition he helped coordinate the WHO’s response to the Indian earthquake and tsunami of 2004, oversaw the UN’s response to the cholera epidemic in Haiti, and was stationed in the Canal Hotel in Baghdad in 2003 when a truck bomb exploded outside, killing 23 people, including the UN’s Special Representative in Iraq,Sérgio Vieira de Mello.\n\nHowever, on his appointment as UN special envoy on ebola in August 2014, following an outbreak of the disease in West Africa, he admitted that while he had worked as a public health doctor for 35 years, he had “never encountered a public health crisis like this in my life”.\n\nThe epidemic is believed to have begun in December 2013 with the death of a two-year-old boy in a remote area of Guinea, but was not recognised until March 2014, by which time it had spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. In every one of 33 previous outbreaks of the disease, public health measures had proved able to contain it, so it took until July, when ebola had spread to the capital cities of the three countries affected, for alarm bells to ring.\n\nBy August when the WHO declared an international public health emergency, the situation was truly alarming. The number of people falling sick was doubling every three weeks; facilities were completely overloaded; hospitals were closing and mortuaries were full. Nabarro recalled that, with international airlines withdrawing services to West Africa, “there was a sense not just of despair but of abandonment”.\n\nNabarro galvanised a co-ordinated international response which rapidly turned the tide against the disease. “The world turned from disbelief to concern, to action, to total involvement,” he recalled. “Within months, we saw the numbers of cases starting to decline, mostly because people themselves took over their destiny and owned the response.” In January 2016 the affected countries were declared ebola-free.\n\nNabarro believed that the international community had learnt important lessons from the epidemic and would be better prepared in future. But as he went on to observe in 2021 in an interview with NPR, there had been a “funny shift” in world politics between 2015, when he was working on ebola, and 2020 when he was appointed WHO special envoy on the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of agreeing to co-operate, he found that world leaders were “just no longer apparently able to work together and deal with this problem through a global response”.\n\nNabarro became a critic of the sort of repeated lockdown measures adopted by some governments in response to recurring outbreaks, advising that such draconian measures should only be used to “take the heat out of the system when things are really bad”, but not as a primary response because of the damage caused to economic and social life.\n\n“We just couldn’t understand why so many countries were see-sawing between what was sometimes called freedom and lockdown,” he told an interviewer later. “That is not the way. You keep your number of cases down by having really good surveillance and detection and isolation.”\n\nBy the beginning of 2022, with scientists identifying a pattern of three- or four-monthly surges of the virus, Nabarro concluded that the world would simply have to get used to living with Covid. “The goal we are aiming for,” he told the BBC, “is a situation where this virus is present, but life is organised so that it is not disrupted.” But, he added, “we need to be humble, this virus is continuing to evolve and we’re never quite sure that we know exactly where it’s going to go next.”\n\nDavid Nunes Nabarro was born on August 26 1949 to John (later Sir John) Nabarro, an eminent physician and endocrinologist (and cousin of the flamboyant Conservative MP Sir Gerald Nabarro), and his wife Joan, née Cockrell, also a doctor.\n\nAfter education at Oundle School, he spent a gap year as a community service volunteer in York, during which he was the subject of a BBC documentary about volunteers. He then read animal physiology and biochemistry at Worcester College, Oxford, staying on to read medicine before completing his clinical training at University College Hospital, London, and qualifying as a physician in 1973.\n\nAfter brief stints working as a medical officer in northern Iraq for Save the Children (SCF), and for the NHS in Britain, from 1976 to 1978 he worked as a district child health officer in east Nepal. He then moved to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, qualifying in public health, and in 1982 was seconded back to SCF as regional manager in South Asia, covering India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nIn 1985 he was appointed senior lecturer in International Community Health at the University of Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Four years later he moved to Nairobi as a strategic adviser for health and population in East Africa for the Overseas Development Administration. The following year he returned to London as the ODA’s chief health and population adviser, moving on to become director of human development in 1997.\n\nHe stayed in this role until he moved to the World Health Organisation, a specialised agency of the UN, in 1999.\n\nOn the afternoon of August 19 2003 Nabarro was attending a meeting with colleagues in the Canal Hotel, the UN’s headquarters in Baghdad, on the floor below the suite of Special Representative Sérgio Vieira de Mello, when the hotel was largely destroyed by a devastating truck bomb.\n\nAlthough he and his colleagues were hit by shards of flying glass they managed to make their way out of the building to a tiny lawn where, he recalled, they found “people dying and dead… people with cuts, people with whole sides of their faces off because of glass. There was a guy with a [metal] pole into his head that went… right through, who was just talking but who was obviously dying. And there was screaming and moaning.”\n\nNabarro himself had been hit in the neck by glass and some colleagues had sustained more serious injuries, but they found some first-aid kits and in the 20 or 30 minutes it took for outside help to arrive, they did what they could to assist the injured.\n\nIt was only later that he learnt of the extent of the damage and the deaths of many close UN colleagues. Yet he took issue with the observation in one obituary of Sérgio Vieira de Mello that “evil triumphed”.\n\n“It is my view,” he said, “that it is not so much evil, it’s actually ignorance, that the people who do this kind of stuff have no understanding at all of what a man like Sérgio … what these people, and their Iraqi colleagues… what they stand for… They just don’t know about absolute goodness. Because if they did, they’d never, ever think of killing these kinds of persons.”\n\nIn 2017 Nabarro was nominated by the British government to succeed Margaret Chan as director-general of the WHO but came second to Tedros Adhanom. He then became a special envoy for the organisation. In 2018 he was appointed professor and co-director of the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.\n\nAs an employer he insisted on high standards – at his daily 9am meetings the doors were shut on the dot and locked to latecomers – but was well-liked by colleagues.\n\nNabarro’s awards for his public health work included the 2015 Helen Keller Humanitarian Award. In 2018 he shared the World Food Prize (often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Agriculture) with Lawrence Haddad. He was appointed CBE in 1992 and knighted KCMG in 2023.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Flo and by five children.\n\nSir David Nabarro, born August 26 1949, died July 26 2025\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"First step in the revival of the county's mothballed General Hospital building set to start",
    "News_text":"The assignment was to reimagine the mothballed and dilapidated General Hospital building that towers over the Eastside as the centerpiece of a vibrant new health-oriented community.\n\nEighteen months after securing anexclusive negotiating agreement,the team selected for the job has completed a conceptual plan and is set to take the first concrete steps in a redevelopment program that could take a decade.\n\nWith an authorization of $120 million for remediation, Centennial Partners has begun design work on upgrades to prepare the 93-year-old building for its new life as a mixed-use center with medical offices, commercial space and up to 824 residential units.\n\nIn its concept plan, Centennial Partners outlined an overarching vision for its proposal to remake the 19-story hospitaland its adjoining 41.9-acre campus into a mixed-use neighborhood of affordable, workforce and market-rate housing, retail stores, health services, open space and connections to public transit.\n\nCalling the project \"a national model for equitable urban development,\" it proposed a phased development with a wide latitude in scale, providing scenarios ranging from as few as 1,480 mixed-income residential units to as many as 4,954, and from 2.1 million to 4.6 million square feet of commercial space.\n\nThe preliminary plan, issued in February, is the basis for a detailed master plan and environmental report Centennial Partners is expected to complete by the spring.\n\nAn item before the Supervisors on Tuesday would set aside $3.3 million to fund that detailed plan. The motion, by Supervisor Hilda Solis, who has championed the project, would also authorize county staff to seek inclusion of the iconic building — long featured in the title scene of the 62-year-old soap opera of the same name—on the National Register of Historic Places. Though loaded withhistoric and cultural significance,the hospital was never nominated.\n\nThe designation would ensure the preservation of its historic character and add another piece of financing, in the form of tax credits, to a plan that would meld private investment with public grants and low-income housing and climate tax credits.\n\nRead more:A new General Hospital: Turning an iconic L.A. landmark into homeless housing\n\nIn June, the supervisors authorized a no-cost lease of the hospital property to the development team to undertake the two-year remediation that would include a seismic upgrade of the hospital building, demolition of 18 structures spread across the campus, decommissioning and replacement of obsolete utilities, and testing to identify soil and materials hazards that would require abatement. Existing tenants of the building, including a community wellness center, would have to be relocated.\n\nThe funds, largely coming from state housing grants and the federal American Rescue plan, would provide $106 million to Centennial Partners, a joint venture led byPrimestor Venture Partners, the Latino-owned company that built the retail center in the city’s redevelopment of the Jordan Downs housing project in South Los Angeles. Of the remainder, $9 million would be held in contingency and $5 million reserved for county management.\n\nThe county would be responsible for relocating tenants that currently occupy the lower four floors of the hospital building, including the nonprofit wellness center that offers free health programs to the surrounding community and the Violence Intervention Program Community Mental Health Center.\n\nThe preliminary report draws a sobering picture of challenges facing the project. Among them are seismic risk, hazardous materials contamination, deteriorating infrastructure, aging and inefficient buildings, parking deficiencies, disconnected streets, fragmented green spaces and Americans With Disabilities Act hurdles. It calls for the engagement of environmental experts, access planners, historical preservation consultants and arborists to work out solutions early in the planning.\n\nThe fundamental problem is a division of the property by a 40-foot drop between the hospital building and its expansive forecourt and the remainder of the campus to the west.\n\nThe plan calls for the forecourt to become \"the programmatic heart of the campus\" that \"serves as the entry into the renovated hospital and functions as a community porch, inviting engagement and interaction.\"\n\nA circulation plan with new entries to the campus from the surrounding streets on all sides would \"allow more gracious approaches to the forecourt and the heart of the campus. A new parking structure would take advantage of the grade, concealing the parking below the forecourt and extending community uses over its roof.\n\nAdditionally, \"a coordinated development, circulation, and green space network\" would help bridge the 40-foot grade.\n\nThe plan divides the campus into seven areas for phased development. First would be the hospital building itself. Its ground floor would become an \"interior street\" while upper floors would be refashioned as housing in chunks of 100 to 250 units to take advantage of public funding sources.\n\nThe remainder of the campus would follow with a mixture of open spaces, new office and retail space and residential buildings that could vary from 49 to 991 units.\n\nInitial remedial work on the unoccupied floors of the hospital building should begin in December. Major work will follow in the spring after completion of the master plan and draft environmental impact report.\n\nThrough its dominating presence on the Eastside and service to low-income residents there,the hospital holds an emotional bond to many who have since risen to prominence.\n\nFunded by a 1923 bond issue, the city’s then-largest building was completed in 1932 and opened the next year with a lofty mission inscribed in stone at its entrance: “To provide care for the acutely ill and suffering to whom the doctors of the attending staff give their services without charge in order that no citizen of the county shall be deprived of health or life for the lack of such care and service.”\n\nOver the years, General Hospital continued to succor the city’s indigent.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, the facility was straining to keep pace with the demands of new medical technology. Lacking air-conditioning and fire sprinklers, it was no longer compliant with tightening air quality and fire standards.\n\nThe supervisors voted in 1990 to begin construction of a replacement.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1994, the Northridge earthquake forced thepermanent closureof a 166-bed psychiatric unit and led tonew state seismic standards for hospitalsthat would require structural upgrades of the massive building.\n\nWith the new nearby County-USC Medical Center finally completed,General Hospital closed on Nov. 7, 2008.\n\nTo a limited extent, it has remained a community asset with its Art Deco vestibule still open to the public. The wellness center occupies much of its vast first floor, and several research teams and training programs use space up to the fourth floor. But the remainder of its 19 floors have been abandoned and fallen into a state of dangling ceiling tiles, broken light bulbs, peeling paint, rusted piping and gathering dust.\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

    "News_title":"How AI helps to solve a big problem with small earthquakes in Yellowstone",
    "News_text":"This is the Kaleidoscope Geyser in the Lower Geyser Basin. George D. Marler and Donald E. White wrote in their 1975 journal paper that “In 1963, about 18 m northwest of Kaleidoscope Geyser, a violent eruption that may have been a single event scattered scores of blocks of sinter about a newly created crater about 3 m in diameter” but suggested that the event was either directly or indirectly related to the Hebgen Lake earthquake. (Photo by George Marler\/ Yellowstone National Park in 1965)\n\nAlthough they mostly go unnoticed by humans, small earthquakes occur much more frequently than large earthquakes, and knowing more about these tiny seismic events can help us better understand the earthquake hazard and geological processes occurring in a region. Usingconventional methods to measure the magnitude of small earthquakes in Yellowstone, however, can be challenging. But perhaps artificial intelligence (AI) approaches offer a solution. After all, AI is already helping to refineearthquake location procedures in Yellowstone.\n\nEarthquake magnitudes are calculated from the energy released by the earthquake as recorded by a seismometer. In Yellowstone, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations (UUSS)operates a network of seismometers to monitor earthquakes in the area. Generally, magnitude measurements for a single earthquake are made at several stations in the network independently, and the estimates are then averaged into the final magnitude that is reported. Accurately computing magnitude values for small earthquakes becomes challenging when 1) there are not enough measurements, or 2) earthquakes are happening close together. This is a particular problem duringswarms of small earthquakesbecause the signals from individual seismic events can overlap. Usually, this can be fixed by a seismic analyst after theylocate the earthquake, but not always! About 2% of the earthquakes in the UUSS catalog do not have a magnitude computed, likely because of a combination of these issues, so the value is reported as -9.99. To solve this problem, let’s reach into our AI toolkit!\n\nMost people are likely familiar with complicated “deep learning” models, like ChatGPT, that accept and output complex data like long text sequences and images. The deep learning models we use in processing small earthquakes are similar, and they take ground motion data from seismometers as the input. Deep learning models like these are a type of machine learning, which describes algorithms that learn patterns in a dataset to estimate values of interest for new data. The models learn the patterns during a training phase, in which the model is provided with examples — sort of like a test with an answer key. After training, the model can accept inputs it has never seen before and estimate the output, given what it learned from the training data.\n\nThere is also a somewhat simpler, though still powerful, type of machine learning that relies on human-defined features that describe the data instead of the more complicated, raw data to make predictions. In arecent study, UUSS scientists used this method to train models to calculate earthquake magnitudes based on short windows of data, so it won’t generally be a problem if earthquakes are close together.\n\nIn the new approach, the UUSS scientists trained one machine learning model for each station in the Yellowstone region using data from the UUSS earthquake catalog. Each model uses features describing the earthquake signal — such as the amplitude — and the location of the earthquake to estimate a magnitude value. The new method makes better use of the available data by accounting for multiple types of seismic waves, and the method also can take advantage of data from more seismic stations because of the rigorous training step. The net result is that there are up to 4 times as many measurements available to calculate a magnitude. Like in the conventional approach, these measurements are combined to determine a final magnitude.\n\nThe new method will ultimately complement, and not replace, the traditional approach for magnitude calculations. This is because traditional methods work very well most of the time (except for these small, nearby events), and because the machine learning approach does have its limitations, mostly because the models are only going to work well for earthquakes that are similar to the training dataset. So, for example, a model may fail to estimate the magnitude of an earthquake occurring near Hebgen Lake if it saw very few training examples from that area. Similarly, if most training examples were greater than M0.5, the model may perform poorly when applied to earthquakes with a magnitude less than 0.5. Combining predictions from multiple station models can help us to remove and identify poor magnitude estimates, but it can be challenging to know when the models are uncertain. In the future, UUSS scientists plan to expand the approach to not only provide a magnitude, but also an assessment of the confidence in that magnitude.\n\nThese machine learning methods are at the current cutting edge of seismology, and Yellowstone provides the perfect location to train and test the new approaches!\n\nYellowstone Caldera Chronicles is a weekly column written by scientists and collaborators of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_title":"Ukraine sees glimmer of hope as Trump shortens deadline for Putin to talk peace",
    "News_text":"US President Donald Trump has said he willslash the 50-day deadlinehe gave for Russia’s Vladimir Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine by weeks, to just “10 or 12 days” from now. But does a shorter deadline make a difference at all, if, as Trump says, his Russian counterpart has already made up his mind to not make peace?\n\nPossibly. Ukraine is facing its most challenging moment on the front lines since the start of the war. By September 3 – when the original 50-day mark would have passed – many of the gains Moscow is in the midst of making would likely be realized.\n\nGiven the pace and strategic nature of the advances Moscow has made in just the past fortnight, it is likely that in the coming weeks its forces will have gotten close to encircling the eastern hubs of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and Kupiansk in the north.\n\nThat would massively change the dynamic of the front lines and bring Putin’s goal of taking the Donetsk region within reach. It would also make the defense of the land between the east of Ukraine and Kyiv a much greater challenge for the winter ahead. Ukraine would have lost control of most of the towns it relies on now to hold the east, and be struggling to retain a grip on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.\n\nTrump’s words were welcomed in Kyiv, where Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said he was “standing firm and delivering a clear message of peace through strength.”\n\n“(The US President) has already said he’s shortening the timeline he gave Putin, because he believes the answer is obvious. Putin respects only power – and that message is loud and clear,” Yermak said on X.\n\nWhat comes in 10 to 12 days is key. Another empty threat or altered Trump deadline would play into theTACO(Trump Always Chickens Out) sensitivities of his administration and be a gift to those who doubt that Trump is willing to really play hardball with the Kremlin.\n\nImposing the secondary sanctions, or tariffs, that Trump has threatened would, however, have enormous global impact. These involve punishing India and China for buying Russian oil and gas.\n\nIndia is a US ally, hugely dependent on Russian energy and allowed to buy it through various complex mechanisms to prevent its demand on other energy markets causing oil prices to soar, damaging the American economy too. China is a Russian ally, even more dependent on Russian energy, and caught in a complex, at times symbiotic, economic relationship with the United States, which often teeters towards a trade war.\n\nIf Trump sanctions either, it will damage the US and the global energy market, and mean his actions have likely been more pronounced and aggressive than any of the actions of his predecessor, US President Joe Biden.\n\nChinese pressure could influence Moscow’s behaviour, but Beijing has also told European diplomats itcannot afford for Russia to losebecause the US would then turn its entire attention to China. China may bank on a weakened Trump rather than rejig its entire geopolitical approach.\n\nAnd so, we have a fortnight in which Moscow must persuade its allies and customers to hold fast in buying the energy they so badly need. Ukraine must try to hold whatever positions it can, in the face of a furious and successful Russian assault. And the Trump administration must decide whether its threats mean something.\n\nAnd if they are unwilling to impose and endure a vast economic earthquake, they must find a convincing off-ramp so their deadlines and threats continue to carry some weight.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_text":"The Big One.\n\nFor most residents of the world, particularly in California, the threat of a gigantic earthquake is always looming – one that would devastate communities, upend life as we know it, cause billions in damage, and take with it untold multitudes of casualties.\n\nScary stuff. But with some earthquakes, there’s also the aftermath, aka tsunamis. And scientists have been looking at one specific fault line off the west coast of North America, with regards to its imminent shifting, and the resulting, potential “mega-tsunami.”\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/K7w_rwArH7s\n\nArecent studyfrom the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences looked at the Cascadia Subduction Zone, an offshore fault line that stretches from North Vancouver Island in Canada to Cape Mendocino in California. The team primarily looked at the flood risks, coupled with sea level rise, in relation to the Cascadia Subduction Zone.\n\nAccording to the study, there’s a 15% chance of a rupture in the Cascadia Subduction Zone in the next 50 years, and a 29% chance by the year 2100.\n\n“Today, and more so in 2100 as background sea levels rise, the immediate effect of earthquake-driven subsidence will be a delay in response and recovery from the earthquake due to compromised assets. Long-term effects could render many coastal communities uninhabitable,” said lead author of the study, Tina Dura.\n\nRelated: Tsunami Drones Deployed at Surf Beach in Japan\n\nThe team also looked at past “mega-tsunamis” to better evaluate the potential carnage in the Pacific Northwest. For example, by examining marine sediments, experts were able to confirm a 1,312-foot tsunami that struck the Hawaiian island of Lanai 105,000 years ago. That one was different, however, as it was created by a volcanic landslide.\n\nAs for the Cascadia Subduction Zone, the last time that tectonic plate shifted was in 1700. It triggered an earthquake registering somewhere between 8.7 to 9.2 on the Richter scale.

    "News_text":"A fault line on theCanadianborder, thought to be dormant for tens of millions of years, could cause a majorearthquake, a new study has revealed.\n\nThe Tintina fault stretches about 600 miles from northeasternBritish ColumbiaintoAlaska. It was previously thought to have last been active around 40 million years ago.\n\nBut a study published inGeophysical Research Lettersearlier this month found signs of more recent activity.\n\nNew topographic data collected from satellites, airplanes and drones showed about an 80-mile-long segment of the fault where 2.6 million-year-old and 132,000-year-old geological formations are laterally shifted across the fault.\n\n“We further show that the fault has not ruptured in a major earthquake for at least 12 thousand years, and could generate an earthquake of at least magnitude 7.5 in the future,” the study read. “The Tintina fault therefore represents an important, previously unrecognized, seismic hazard to the region.”\n\nAn earthquake with a 7 to 7.9 magnitude is considered major and can create serious damage, according toMichigan Tech. These types of earthquakes are fairly rare, with only 10 to 15 estimated to occur each year.\n\nMichigan Tech warns earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 or greater, which typically occur only once every year or two, can destroy communities near the epicenter.\n\n“Based on the data, we think that the fault may be at a relatively late stage of a seismic cycle, having accrued a slip deficit, or build-up of strain, of six meters in the last 12,000 years,” Theron Finley, a recent University of Victoria phD graduate and lead author of the new study, explained inSciTechDaily. “If this were to be released, it would cause a significant earthquake.”\n\nTheDaily Mailreported, citing seismologists, there are fears the fault line could send tremors into British Columbia,AlbertaandMontana.\n\nDr. Michael West, state seismologist at the Alaska Earthquake Center, told the Mail, “It is one of the least studied fault systems in North America, and that needs to change.”",

    "News_text":"TheLos Angeles wildfiresand severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according toa new report from the insurance company Munich Re.\n\nOverall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.\n\nBy this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.\n\nOf the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\n\nThe L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.\n\nClimate changeplayed a role in the wildfiresby increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive,according to scientists.\n\n\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.\n\nAs more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.\n\nAnother major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.\n\nWeather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.\n\nIn seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.\n\n\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.\n\nWith hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.\n\n\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas.

    "News_text":"Jul. 29—GRAND FORKS — A former Kittson County sheriff's deputy and his wife have been bound over to a Giles County, Tennessee, grand jury for allegations of labor trafficking and animal cruelty.\n\nJames Edward Hewitt, 65, and Kelli D. Hewitt, 64, were arrested in early July. The couple are charged with involuntary labor servitude, trafficking for forced labor or services, aggravated cruelty to animals and three counts of cruelty to animals.\n\nCourt documents say the couple harbored a child from a Haitian orphanage and subjected her to involuntary servitude or manual labor. They also allegedly possessed and concealed the girl's birth certificate while forcing her to perform manual labor.\n\nThe documents do not specify a time period of the alleged labor crimes, nor the girl's age then or now.\n\nWhen the Hewitt property, located in Pulaski, Tennessee, was searched July 2, law enforcement alleged in affidavits of complaint they found a dog severely flea-infested, anemic and at a substantial risk of death; no fewer than 31 dogs residing primarily outdoors without doghouses; no fewer than 44 dogs confined without water; eight chickens, one duck and a turkey in states of starvation, lacking necessary food; and one deceased turkey.\n\nAlthough nothing in the court documents confirm the Hewitts are the same as the Hewitts who previously lived in northwest Minnesota, a search of a LinkedIn profile for \"Jim Hewitt\" indicates they are the same.\n\nThe profile says he retired from the Kittson County Sheriff's Office for 15 years, where he worked from 2002 to 2017.

    "News_title":"20 years later, NatGeo’s ‘Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time’ docuseries exposes failures and heroes",
    "News_text":"The systems meant to protect Americans failed in August 2005 — but everyday people and quick-thinking National Guard and military service members rose above the flood waters and proved that small acts of courage can save lives.\n\n“In order to prevent something [horrible], you have to understand why it happened in the first place,” intones a voice in the trailer for National Geographic’s powerful new documentary series “Hurricane Katrina: Race Against Time,” now streaming on Hulu and Disney+.\n\nFromLightbox, Executive Producer Ryan Coogler, and Oscar®-nominated director Traci A. Curry, this five-part series offers the most intimate and comprehensive telling of the Katrina story to date — told entirely through the voices of those who lived it.\n\nOne of those voices is that ofShelton Shakespear Alexander, a United States Marine Corps veteran and poet who pressed record on his personal camera as the winds started picking up in Katrina’s advance. When the levees broke, he evacuated to the Superdome, where his footage captured what it was like for the most vulnerable people during the deadly hurricane.\n\nHe showed people how to eat MREs and revealed what it was like during the hours they waited for rescue, and he lifted one another up.\n\n“I wish more people had a chance to learn survival skills like swimming or preparedness,” he shared, reflecting on the senseless lives lost because of a lack of preparation or early warning. “They didn’t give us a fair warning. We need to do a better job of caring for our elders, our parents, and the secluded. I hated to learn about all the people who passed alone.”\n\nAs the documentary shows, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina was exacerbated by man-made errors. When the levees broke, eighty percent of the city and ninety-five percent of St. Bernard Parish were flooded, leaving over 100,000 people vulnerable to catastrophe. New Orleans, six feet below sea level and surrounded by multiple bodies of water, was known to be at risk of flooding, which is why Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to overhaul the region’s hurricane protection system.\n\nYet, due to budget cuts and delays,the project was not finishedby the time Katrina hit in August 2005. In the immediate aftermath, the federal response was also sluggish. Luckily, quick thinkers in the Coast Guard and other military units acted independently.\n\n“Sarah Faulkner was a badass Coast Guard Rescue Diver who helped save 40 people in one night,” beamed director Traci A. Curry.\n\n“What was really interesting about the Coast Guard’s response was that they acted outside of the chain of command,” Curry explained. “While the rest of the military was tied up in bureaucratic red tape, the Coast Guard could go into action right away. They went straight to New Orleans and got to work, and I thought it was so important to highlight their actions.”\n\nWhen asked what Shelton is hoping this documentary will teach audiences, he emphasized the importance of uniting together aspeople,especially in a time when our country feels particularly divided:\n\n“Let’s focus on coming back together. Being American. Being together. We don’t know who’s gonna get a wildfire, who’s gonna get an earthquake, who’s gonna get a storm, who’s gonna get a flood. We just need for the sake of humanity — it’s not a political thing, it’s individual — and we need to check our hearts and help out when we can.”\n\nThis five-part series premiered on National Geographic across two nights beginning July 27, 2025.

    "News_title":"With Biden gone, and faced with indescribable famine, the Democratic consensus on Israel and Gaza shifts",
    "News_text":"The crisis in Gaza reachednew horrific levels this weekas the world’s leading authority on famine and food security declared thatmass starvation and death is imminentwithin the enclave unlessIsraeli forces begin allowing more aid into the Strip.\n\nIn Washington, the mood among Democrats on the issue is dark. Having chained their party to support for Israel under the Biden administration, the party suffered a devastating defeat in 2024 and are now being forced to watch a resurgence on the progressive pro-Palestinian left.\n\nDespite breathless insistences to the contrary by center-left commentators, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the base of the Democratic Party is shifting away from the pro-Israel consensus long upheld by the DC foreign policy establishment.\n\nIt’s not just the left, either; new polling shows a generational divide across all party lineson the issue of sympathy forsupportof Palestinian statehoodand an end to the slaughter in Gaza.\n\nFew will say it openly, but no one is denying it on the left: there has been an earthquake within the party.\n\nThe upstart victory of Zohran Mamdani in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor came amid a barrage of coverage from the mainstream media — including his hometown papers, theNew York TimesandNew York Post —whichoften insinuatedthat Mamdani harbored anti-Semitic beliefs orfalsely accusedhim of expressing them. It also rebuked the endorsements of aging Democratic would-be kingmakers Bill Clinton and James Clyburn, who issued late-game endorsements of New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo.\n\nIn a poll out Tuesday from the IMEU Policy Projectconducted by Data for Progress, a clear portrait of the race emerges. Nearly eight in 10 New York mayoral primary voters said they believed Israel was committinga genocide in Gaza.\n\nPutting aside the mayoral race entirely for a moment — how does a candidate in the ideological vein of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris fare among an electorate like that?\n\nIn the same poll, 63 percent of Democratic primary voters in the city supported what could easily be described as Mamdani’s most hardline position on the matter of Israel-Palestine: his support for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were he ever to visit the city. A lower figure than the number that are willing to assign the term “genocide” to the conflict, but far from insignificant.\n\nA news article in the Jewish magazine Forwardput the question plainly on Monday:“After Mamdani and Gaza, are Democrats turning against Israel?”\n\nDemocrats in New York and across the country are quickly waking up to the rapidly shifting ground beneath them.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat and vocal critic of his colleagues in the so-called “Squad,” bluntly assessed that he could not win a Democratic primary for governor in the state after Mamdani’s victory.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House Minority Leader, reportedly told allies that hedoubts his abilityto win the speakership with Mamdani in play.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand, New York’s junior US senator,issued a humbling apologyto Mamdani after accusing him (falsely) of supporting “jihad.”\n\nThe efforts to dodge what could be a historic wave of primary challenges fueled by progressive rage over the next three years are hastily getting underway.\n\nJoe Biden’s departure from the White House and Netanyahu’s close alliance with Trump make criticizing Israel a much easier prospect for Democrats. The mass starvation and shocking killings of Palestinians at aid reception areas by Israeli troops have accelerated the criticism of Israel from Washington Democrats in the past week.\n\nIn the Senate, a large coalition of Democrats led by Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Trump administration to publicly break with the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and return to reliance on neutral international groups to provide aid. Van Hollen, who was a lonely voice for Palestinian suffering under the Biden administration, now has the backing of nearly half of his caucus.\n\nOne unsurprising holdout was John Fetterman, the Pennsylvania senator and vocal supporter of Israel, including some of its most controversial war-fighting methods that have been denounced as war crimes by the International Criminal Court and others.\n\nFetterman, up for reelection in 2028, has vultures circling him. Conor Lamb, his former primary opponent, is punching him relentlessly on social media and in a series of public appearances he’s made at town hall-style events across the state.\n\nLamb, who tweeted in support of destroying Hamas and supporting Israel after the October 7 attacks, lost out on endorsements from the progressive left that now despises Fetterman when they ran against each other in 2022. Another Pennsylvania congressman, a Democrat,tweeted (publicly!)that he hopes Fetterman doesn’t run for president.\n\nThis past week, Lamb tweeted that he hopes Pope Leo, the first American pontiff, “continues to speak against starvation and barbarity in Gaza.”\n\nMembers of the House are speaking out as well.\n\nRep. Andre Carson, a Democrat from Indiana, came out in support of an arms embargo against Israel on Monday while accusing Netanyahu’s government of “starving” the population of Gaza.\n\nOthers, including Madeleine Dean, demanded another ceasefire be hammered out. Torres attacked a Republican colleague for making repeated Islamophobic remarks about Rep. Ilhan Omar, and in an interview with Chuck Todd blasted Netanyahu for doing “irreparable” harm to the relationship between Israel and the Democratic Party.\n\nLeadership is lagging behind but clearly feels the wind shifting: Minority Whip Katherine Clark and Jeffries released statements on Friday on the starvation, each condemning the crisis, neither one using the word “Israel” at any point.\n\nEven Barack Obama, hesitant as he typically is to speak out on the issue of the day in his post-presidency, put out a statement seemingly critical of Israel, writing in part: “There is no justification for keeping food and water away from civilian families.”\n\nThe only Democrats who are being truly silent on the issue are tied directly to the former administration. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris are widely seen as two of the most likely to contend for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination. Neither has issued a word about Gaza for months. Harris, also thought to be considering a run for governor of California, hasn’t sat for a long-form interview this year.\n\nIn the end it could be difficult to determine exactly how much of the stink attached to former Biden-world figures relates to Gaza, as opposed to the year(s?)-long coverup of the president’s declining faculties.\n\nOne thing is for certain: something shifted in the past week, something beyond just the fallout from election of a charismatic Muslim candidate in a prominent but isolated primary race.",

    "News_text":"Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, along with the entire West Coast were under atsunami alertissued after a massive 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Tuesday afternoon in Eastern Russia.\n\nThe quake, according to theU.S. Geological Survey, hit at 4:25 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time at a depth of around 11 miles, some 80 miles southeast of Petropavlovsk Kamchatka, Russia, and was one of the strongest tremblers ever recorded.\n\nSeveral large aftershocks were recorded after the initial quake, though despite tsunami waves that hit Japan and moved across the Pacific, prompting evacuations in Hawaii and heightened warnings in Northern California, there were no reports of substantial damage.\n\nKTLA Interactive Weather Radar\n\nJust before 1 a.m., officials with the National Weather Servicereportedthat the tsunami had reached the Northern California coastline and was showing up in the Arena Cove tide gauge as it continued its path southward.\n\nAlong the Southern California coastline, where an initial “Tsunami Watch” wasupgradedto a “Tsunami Advisory” just after 7 p.m., NWS appeared most concerned about areas north of Point Conception.\n\n“We are carefully monitoring the situation for ports and harbors north of Point Conception as tsunami waves will likely be larger in that area,”NWS said in a post to X. “Go away from the coast, or if in a boat, go out to deep water!”\n\nResidents in coastal areas were urged to stay abreast of additional updates and be aware of estimated tsunami start times, some of which included the following:\n\nL.A. Harbor, July 30 at 1:05 a.m.\n\nSanta Barbara, July 30 at 12:50 a.m.\n\nNewport Beach, July 30 at 1:10 a.m.\n\nLa Jolla, July 30 at 1:15 a.m.\n\nSan Francisco, July 30 at 12:50 a.m.\n\nHuntington Beach,Seal Beachand Laguna Beach closed their beaches and piers in response to the advisory. While L.A. County beaches remained open a little later, officials with the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department were seen in aerial footage captured by Sky5 clearing local beaches and piers, including in Santa Monica.\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass said in astatementthat port police and the city’s emergency officials were “actively responding to tonight’s Tsunami Advisory,” before urging workers and residents in the area to avoid the waterline and follow any instructions issued by officials.\n\nNo evacuation orders were issued for any Southern California coastal communities, though the tsunami advisory remained in effect until further notice.\n\nHistorically, Angelenos are unlikely to experience serious damage from tsunamis. A similarly strong quake off the coast of Chile in 1960 created the“most significant remote tsunami”to hit Southern California.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"A tsunami has hit coastal areas ofRussia’s Kuril Islands and Japan’s large northern islandof Hokkaido after a powerful, 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia early Wednesday. Warnings are also in place for Alaska, Hawaii and other coasts south toward New Zealand.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said a tsunami as high as 40 centimeters (1.3 feet) had been detected in 16 locations as the waves moved south along the Pacific coast from Hokkaido to just northeast of Tokyo. Officials urged caution, saying that bigger waves could come later.\n\nDamage and evacuations were reported in the Russian regions nearest the quake’s epicenter on theKamchatka Peninsula.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nThe earthquake at 8:25 a.m. Japan time had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japan and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its measurement to 8.8 magnitude.\n\nIt appears to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the March 2011 quake off northeast Japan that was 9.0 magnitude and caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant.\n\nOnly a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.\n\nInternet and phone connections have been restored in Kamchatka following the massive earthquake, according to the Russian news agency Tass.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed the façade of a collapsed kindergarten in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. No casualties were reported.\n\nA port in Severo-Kurilsk, on the Kuril Islands in the Pacific, was flooded after a tsunami wave hit the area.\n\nRussian news agencies quoting the regional Health Ministry said several people sought medical help in Kamchatka after the earthquake, but no serious injuries were reported.\n\nFerries connecting Hokkaido and Aomori on the northern tip of Japan’s Honshu island were suspended, as well as those connecting Tokyo and nearby islands.\n\nSome local train operations have been suspended or delayed as well, according to operators.\n\nSendai airport says its runway has been temporarily closed.\n\nJapan Meteorological Agency says a tsunami as high as 40 centimeters (1.3 feet) has been detected at 16 locations as the waves have moved south along the Pacific coast from Hokkaido down to just northeast of Tokyo.\n\nOfficials urge residents to use caution as bigger waves could come later.\n\nNew Zealand authorities issued warnings of “strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges” along coastlines throughout the country.\n\nThe alert by the government emergency management agency said people should move out of the water, off beaches and shore areas, and away from harbors, marinas, rivers and estuaries.\n\nJapanese nuclear power plants along the Pacific coasts have suspended their work schedule in response to the tsunami alert, but so far no abnormalities have been reported.\n\nTokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which operates the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, said about 4,000 workers are taking shelter at higher grounds on the plant complex while monitoring remotely to ensure plant safety.\n\nIts release of treated radioactive wastewater into the sea is also temporarily suspended as a cautionary step.\n\nThe 8.8-magnitude earthquake was the strongest to hit that area in Kamchatka since 1952, according to the local branch of the Geophysical Survey of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn a statement posted on their Telegram channel, they called the earthquake a “unique event.” They said the epicenter was near a recent earthquake that struck the peninsula on July 20.\n\nWhile the situation “was under control,” they said there are risks of aftershocks, which could last for up to a month, and warned against visiting certain coastal areas.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Emergency Managementsaid on Facebookthat small tsunami waves were expected to reach parts of the state’s coastline starting around 11:40 p.m. local time, with wave heights between 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimeters).\n\nIt urged people to stay away from beaches, harbors and marinas and to remain in a safe location away from the coast until the advisory is lifted.\n\n“This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,” the department said.\n\nOregon is under a tsunami advisory, along with much of the U.S. West Coast spanning British Columbia, Washington state and California.",

If it is, learn the fastest way to higher ground.\n\nWalk it. Time it. Memorize it. You’ll need an evacuation plan in place to get your family to a safe place regardless of where they are.\n\nA tsunami can come minutes after a large earthquake. If the shaking lasts longer than 20 seconds and you are near the coast, don’t wait for an alert. Move to higher ground right away. Do not go back for anything.\n\nDo not waste time getting your car unless it is part of your plan and ready to go. Roads will be crowded or damaged.\n\nYou need to have an evacuation plan in place. If you don’t, then walk, quickly, to a safe zone.\n\nTsunami waves can reach several stories high. You need to move at least 100 feet above sea level or one mile inland, whichever is closer and safer. Look for signs marked “Tsunami Evacuation Route” and follow them. Do not stop.\n\nGet Hawaii’s latest morning news delivered to your inbox, sign up for News 2 You\n\nTsunami waves travel up rivers and streams connected to the ocean. Stay away from bridges, harbors and waterways. Head inland and keep moving until you are well outside the danger zone.\n\nBring a portable radio or HAM radio. Do not count on phones or the internet to work. Stay tuned until the threat is over.\n\nRemember that some tsunamis have more than one wave. Do not return home until officials say it is safe.\n\nMake sure your whole family knows where to meet. You need to have a meeting place that is easy to access for everyone and practice regularly. If you get separated, go to the agreed location and wait. Keep a contact list with you at all times.\n\nHow to prep: Keep a small emergency kit packed and ready. It needs to include food, water, flashlight, first aid supplies, radio, clothes, documents and cash. A go-bag should be light enough to carry for long distances.\n\nEven after the first wave, danger may not be over. Roads may be flooded, and structures may be unsafe.

    "News_title":"Along California coast, waiting for tsunami waves with concern, curiosity, comedy",
    "News_text":"From the Santa Monica Bay to Hawaii and beyond, coastal residents had their day upended by a faraway, massive earthquake in Russia that brought tsunami alerts to a wide swath of the Pacific.\n\nTsunami waves were expected to hit Hawaii and, later, the California coast. Southern California is expected to see only modest waves, but the most-northern parts of the state could see larger ones.\n\nAt Dockweiler, Aaron Travis and Maris Vellavura, two Australians who were visiting California for a work trip, had been unaware of the tsunami advisory as they hung out.\n\nStrolling alongside the beach, they said they were enjoying the final days of a U.S. trip that had lasted for a couple of weeks.\n\nThey were surprised but not worried.\n\n“It would have been nice to know about it,” Travis said, laughing. “It isn’t too bad really. Like, you never know how big they’re going to be, whether it’s a fail or not.”\n\nConnor Cunningham said he left his phone at home but began to regret that after learning of the advisory. A Playa Vista local, he pondered the possibilities.\n\n“Like, do I even have a plan? Like, what if this happened?” he said. “Playa Vista is a little bit low. If I was up the hills, I wouldn’t really be thinking about it, but like, maybe I should plan.”\n\nSiblings Bianca and Josue Mendez and their friend Miguel Silva were walking and biking alongside the sand. Bianca was on a visit from Nebraska to visit her brother, and thought visiting the beach could be fun.\n\nShe was sorely disappointed when the advisory threatened to put a crimp in those plans.\n\n“I asked AI, like, ‘Is it OK to go to the beach?’” Bianca said.\n\nThe three were surprised at the number of undisturbed beachgoers.\n\n“I don’t think it’s stopping anyone,” Josue said.\n\nIn Crescent City, a remote Northern California harbor townwhere tsunamis are a way of life, the Tuesday evening barflies gathered at Port O'Pints Brewing Co. were decidedly blasé about the possibility of impending disaster.\n\nThe TVs on the wall were still playing the Giants game and the CBS sitcom “Young Sheldon” instead of cable or local news. And the roughly two dozen patrons were drinking and relaxing, though plenty were looking at their phones.\n\n“People really don’t start doing much until you hear the sirens. Right now, most people are just hanging out, waiting to see if it progresses. And if it progresses, you gotta go, go go,” said bartender and Crescent City native Jacob Swift.\n\nThis was far from his first tsunami-alert rodeo.\n\nWhen the tsunami advisory in the region was upgraded to a tsunami warning, patrons commented on it, then returned to their business, Swift said.\n\n“We get these fairly often. Often enough to where nobody's really panicking right now,” Swift added.\n\nPort O'Pints owner John Kirk picked up the phone and noted that despite being a ways from the rugged coastline, the bar was technically in the flood zone.\n\nKirk, who works by day delivering babies as the county’s only OB-GYN, said he wasn’t drinking that night because he was on call.\n\nThe vibe in his Irish brewpub remained fairly chill, he added.\n\n“If the water starts rolling up on us, well, somebody will probably run,” he noted dryly.\n\nManny Jimenez has worked at Old Tony’s, a classic bar and seafood restaurant on the Redondo Beach Pier, for 42 years.\n\nFeaturing souvenir mai tai glasses and faded photos of celebrities on its walls, the old-fashioned watering hole was built over the Pacific Ocean in 1952.\n\nJimenez, 65, is now bar manager at Old Tony’s, where he was at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday. He told The Times that he had never heard of a tsunami damaging businesses on the pier.\n\n“Big waves, yes, but not tsunamis,” he said, noting that “15-, 20-foot waves” occasionally would cause some damage before the pier was rebuilt following a catastrophic fire on May 27, 1988.\n\nJimenez said the laid-back nightspot would not be taking any extra precautions due to the looming tsunami and would close at midnight as usual.\n\n“Anything can happen. You never know. It’s Mother Nature,” he said as he gathered empty glasses patrons had left on the bar. “But I’m confident we’ll be fine.”\n\nThe approaching tsunami was the topic of discussion outside the entrance of the Queen Mary, the iconic ship that has been docked in the Port of Long Beach since 1967.\n\n“You got three hours until the tsunami hits,” a man told his friends outside the entrance as they prepared to leave.\n\n“We better get out of here then,” a woman responded.\n\nNearby, Madison Aguilera, 21, and her two friends, Azalia Ortiz, 23, and Omar Mora, 20, stood outside the ship.\n\nThe trio were driving from Pico Rivera on the 710 Freeway to Long Beach when they got an alert about a tsunami.

    "News_text":"One of thestrongest earthquakesever recorded struck Russia’s Far East early Wednesday, causing tsunami waves to wash ashore in Japan and Alaska and calls for people around the Pacific to be on alert or move to higher ground.\n\nThe 8.8 magnitude temblor set off warnings in Hawaii, North and Central America and Pacific islands south toward New Zealand, with officials warning that the potential tsunami danger may last for more than a day.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey believes Wednesday’s earthquake would potentially tie with the sixth largest earthquake recorded, which happened in Chile in 2010, but said it needs more data to verify that.\n\nHere's a glance at some of the most powerful earthquakes recorded previously, according to the USGS.\n\n1. Biobío, Chile\n\nA 9.5 magnitude earthquake struck in a central region of Chile in 1960. Known as the Valdivia or Great Chilean earthquake, the largest ever recorded temblor resulted in more than 1,600 deaths in Chile and beyond, most of them caused by a large tsunami. Thousands of people were injured.\n\n2. Alaska\n\nIn 1964, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake jolted Alaska’s Prince William Sound, lasting for almost 5 minutes. More than 130 people were killed in the largest recorded earthquake in the U.S. and subsequent tsunami. There were huge landslides and towering waves that caused severe flooding. The event was followed by thousands of aftershocks for weeks after the initial quake.\n\n3. Sumatra, Indonesia\n\nA 9.1 magnitudeearthquake and resulting tsunamidevastated Southeast and South Asia and East Africa in 2004, killing 230,000 people. Indonesia alone recorded more than 167,000 deaths as entire communities were wiped out.\n\n4. Tohoku, Japan\n\nA magnitude 9.1 earthquakestruck off the coast of northeastern Japan in 2011, triggering a towering tsunami that smashed into the Fukushima nuclear plant. It knocked out power and cooling systems and triggered meltdowns in three reactors. More than 18,000 people were killed in the quake and tsunami, some of whom have never been recovered.\n\n5. Kamchatka, Russia\n\nIn 1952, a magnitude 9.0 quake caused significant damage but no reported deaths despite a tsunami that hit Hawaii with 9.1-meter (30-foot) waves.\n\n6. Biobío, Chile\n\nAn 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit central Chile in 2010, shaking the capital for a minute and half and setting off a tsunami. More than 500 people were killed in the disaster.\n\n7. Esmeraldas, Ecuador\n\nIn 1906, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami killed about 1,500 people. Its effects were felt for miles along the Central American coast and as far away as San Francisco and Japan.\n\n8. Alaska\n\nIn 1965, a magnitude 8.7 quake struck Alaska’s Rat Islands, causing an 11-meter (35-foot) -high tsunami. There was some minor damage, including cracks in buildings and an asphalt runway.\n\n9. Tibet\n\nAt least 780 people were killed when a magnitude 8.6 earthquake struck in 1950. Dozens of villages were destroyed, including at least one that slid into a river. There were also major landslides that jammed the Subansiri River in India. When the water eventually broke through, it resulted in a deadly 7-meter (23-foot) wave.\n\n10. Sumatra, Indonesia\n\nIn 2012, a powerful 8.6 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of northern Sumatra in Indonesia. Though the quake caused little damage, it increased pressure on a fault that was the source of the devastating 2004 tsunami.",

It is a warning. Which means we have to evacuate the coastal zones right away.”\n\n10 tips when you need to evacuate for a tsunami\n\nThe wave is the result of a powerful earthquake in the Pacific, with ocean data confirming a tsunami will follow. Sirens have already sounded across the islands and will sound again at 6:10 p.m. and 6:40 p.m. to mark one hour and 30 minutes before landfall.\n\n“We had a 9.0 earthquake, which is very significant,” Gov. Green said. “That created a seven-foot wave that hit Maui, causing $7.5 million of damage.”\n\n“If you stay on beaches, you could risk death,” Gov. Green said. “You must stay off the beaches and away from harbors, rivers, and low-lying areas.”\n\nResidents in tsunami evacuation zones must leave immediately. Those in multi-story buildings can go up at least four stories to stay safe.\n\nWhat’s the difference between tsunami warning, watch?\n\n“Please know where the tsunami evacuation zone is and have a route to get out to higher ground,” Gov. Green said. “If you are in a building, you can go up four stories. You will be safe in that case.”\n\nThe expected wave is not expected to hit just one part of the islands.\n\n“It will wrap around the islands very likely, therefore causing a wave in Hilo and in Kona and Kauaʻi and on Maui,” Gov. Green said.\n\nHow to prepare for a tsunami\n\nAdjunct General Major General Stephen Logan confirmed major infrastructure actions already underway.\n\n“Hilo Airport is the only one that is closed,” Adjunct General Major General Logan said. “The United States Coast Guard has already closed all of the major ports.”\n\n“All ships have been ordered out to sea,” he continued. “State highways is staging vehicles and equipment throughout their island and county.”\n\nOn Molokaʻi, Kalaupapa Airport personnel are ready to evacuate to the lighthouse. On the Hawaii Island, Hilo Airport has suspended commercial operations to help with evacuations.\n\nAdjunct General Major General Logan said military assets are ready and positioned across the islands.\n\n“With the approval of Gov. Green, I’ve activated two medevac aircraft for the island of Oʻahu,” he said. “They carry with them a search and rescue capability with an infrared radar system that can see throughout the night.”\n\nHigh-water and heavy-vehicle troops are also standing by.\n\n“I’ve also ordered the activation of numerous troops and soldiers on all of the counties to provide a heavy vehicle capability,” Adjunct General Major General Logan said.\n\nOfficials are still waiting for the wave to pass Midway Island for more precise data.\n\n“In about five minutes, we’ll reconvene a statewide meeting, and we will hear an update on the size of the wave,” Gov. Green said.\n\nReadings from ocean buoys between Russia and Midway confirmed the threat.\n\n“It was clear to us that there was going to be a wave,” Gov. Green said. “We don’t know how large a wave, usually until it passes Midway.”\n\nOnce the wave passes, emergency teams will begin damage assessments. But officials stress that no one should return to the coast until the all-clear is given.\n\nResidents can check their evacuation zones by clickinghere.\n\nGet news on the go withKHON 2GO, KHON’s morning podcast, every morning at 8\n\n“Please do not put anyone in a situation where General Logan has to search and find you with a helicopter,” Gov.

Travellers are being warned to follow the advice of local authorities and watch for updates if they are in a place where an alert has been issued.\n\nTsunamiwaves reached Hawaii, with a 1.2 metre swell recorded off Oahu. A 1.74 metre was recorded at Kahului, Maui, while one of 1.5 metres was recorded in Hilo.\n\nHawaii Governor Josh Green has asked people to follow evacuation orders and stay calm.\n\nThe tsunami warning has since been downgraded, and evacuees have been permitted to return home.\n\nA 1.3 metre wave reached Japan's northern Iwate prefecture, according to the country's weather agency, with others showing up in the Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures.\n\nThe tsunami has also hit the coast of California, according to the US National Weather Service.\n\nIn Indonesia, residents and tourists in Papua, North Sulawesi, North Maluku and Gorontalo have been advised not to approach coastal areas.\n\nFerries connecting Hokkaido and Aomori on the northern tip of Japan’s Honshu island were suspended, as well as those connecting Tokyo and nearby islands.\n\nSome local train operations have been suspended or delayed as well, according to operators.\n\nSendai airport says its runway has been temporarily closed with two domestic flights, one from Fukuoka and another from Osaka, diverted to other airports.\n\nJapan Airlines and All Nippon Airways have cancelled all flights to Sendai airport.\n\nHundreds of delays have been recorded at other Japanese airports including Narita International, Tokyo International (Haneda), Kansai International and Fukuoka.\n\nSeveral flights were diverted away from Hawaii followingtsunamiwarnings, according to FlightRadar24.

As a safety precaution, Alaska Airlines said that flights en route to Hawaii are returning to the mainland or diverting as needed.\n\n\"Guests with travel to, from or within the Hawaiian Islands should check the status of their flight before heading to the airport.

Under this advisory, people should stay out of the water and away from beaches and coastal waterways. Officials have cautioned that the first waves to arrive may not be the largest, however, and that there is still risk over the next 24 hours.

It is the strongest earthquake of the year and is believed to be among the six strongest quakes on record.\n\nThe resultingwaves first hit Japan’s Hokkaido and Russia’s Kuril Islands, before racing across the Pacific Ocean.\n\nTsunami warnings were in effect for Hawaii, Alaska's Aleutian Islands, and parts of NorthernCalifornia, while most of the West Coast was placed under a less severe tsunami advisory.\n\nThe first waves reached Alaska and Hawaii early Wednesday morning, with other Western U.S. states bracing for impact. Here’s what you need to know about how the tsunami could impact the U.S:\n\nJust before 7.20 p.m. local time, waters could be seen gradually receding in Kauai’s Hanalei Bay and at Haleiwa Boat Harbor on Oahu’s North Shore.\n\nThe first waves reportedly arrived in Hawaii about ten minutes later.\n\nWaves up to 4 feet tall crashed into the shores of Haleiwa, while water levels rose by 2.8 feet at Hanalei Bay and reached 2.3 feet above sea level in Honolulu.\n\nAt Midway Atoll, the last buoy measurement site in the central Pacific Ocean before Hawaii, sea levels rose almost 6 feet above normal, implying potential for higher waves in Hawaii.\n\nHawaiians began fleeing coastal areas Tuesday afternoon as officials warned of tsunami waves reaching up to 10 feet.\n\nMountain roads quickly became clogged with traffic as residents raced to higher ground. Flights at major airports were canceled amid the unfolding emergency, with about 200 passengers sheltering in Maui’s Kahului Airport terminal, according to the Hawaii Department of Transportation.\n\nHawaii Governor Josh Green declared an emergency and urged residents to “please take this very seriously,” adding that waves could drown people, cause power outages, and uproot trees.\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged on Truth Social for Americans to “STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!”\n\nHawaii had reported no damage from the waves by late Tuesday, with Governor Green saying there was “no wave of consequence.” The state remained “at least two to three hours” from being in the clear, he told reporters at an 8:20 p.m. press conference.\n\n“So far, though, at the moment, so good,” he added.\n\nThe tsunami waves likely reached their maximum height on Tuesday evening, Chip McCreery, the director of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, told reporters.\n\nA tsunami warning, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s most severe alert, was issued Tuesday for Alaska’s western Aleutian Islands – from Samalga Pass to Attu – and the Pribilof Islands.\n\nForecast models predicted that waves could reach higher than 5ft in parts of the affected areas.\n\nJust before 5.15 p.m. PT on Tuesday, a tidal surge of 1ft was recorded near Alaska’s volcanic island of Amchitka. Other localized reports of wave measurements in Alaska towns have not yet been published.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center confirmed late Tuesday that waves about a foot tall had been recorded in Alaska.\n\nTsunami advisories were issued on Tuesday for California,Oregon, and Washington, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center said most areas along the U.S. West Coast were expected to see wave heights of a foot or less, though some locations could experience significantly higher surges.\n\nIn Port Orford, Oregon, waves are predicted to reach up to two feet, while Crescent City, California, is forecast to see waves between 3.1 and 5.7 feet.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Emergency Management said that while the first waves to hit the coast may not be the largest, conditions can be dangerous “even if no large wave is visible.”\n\nFurther south, Port San Luis could see wave heights ranging from 1.7 to 3.2 feet.\n\nIn San Francisco, officials warned of strong, dangerous currents likely to impact beaches, harbors, marina docks, and finger piers along the shoreline.\n\nEmergency management authorities said they were closely monitoring conditions and assessing whether evacuations would be necessary.\n\nTsunami waves have reached the coast of Washington on Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service’s Seattle officesaid.Residents have been urged to keep away from the water and shore.",

In the morning, those sheltering will be rescreened prior to departures,” the DOT said.\n\nBaggage screening was temporarily suspended at Honolulu’s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport during the first wave arrival; however, baggage screening has now resumed and flights have restarted.\n\n“Please check with your individual carriers regarding flight schedules,” the DOT added.\n\nCarriers such as Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have issued a travel waiver for its passengers, allowing them to change or cancel their trip amid the tsunami.\n\nHawaii Governor Josh Green said on Tuesday that all commercial harbours have been shut, too.\n\nAs the Foreign Office has not warned against non-essential travel to Hawaii, or the US as a whole, there will be no special circumstances in place to be able to cancel a trip for a full refund.\n\nThe conditions for cancelling your trip will be dependent on your holiday provider, so it’s best to contact them if you’re looking to postpone.\n\nThere is no obligation for companies to refund bookings if you want to cancel, and you will not be able to claim on your travel insurance due to safety concerns unless government advice changes.\n\nIf you do have travel insurance, some policies include natural disaster cover for an event that prevents you from reaching your holiday destination.

    "News_title":"How to Stay Safe During a Tsunami",
    "News_text":"More than a dozen countries are on alert for potential tsunami activity after the world’s sixth-biggest earthquake hit eastern Russia.\n\nThe 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday morning has already resulted in the first tsunami waves on Japan’s Hokkaido coast, while residents in Hawaii have been advised to move to higher ground amid blaring tsunami sirens. Much of the West Coast, Alaska, and countries in the Pacific have also received tsunami alerts of varying levels.\n\nRead More:Sixth-Largest Earthquake on Record Triggers Global Tsunami Warnings\n\nHere’s what to know in the event of a tsunami.\n\nA tsunami is a series of massive waves caused by earthquakes or undersea volcanic eruptions, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Ocean Service. Seismic activity can cause sudden ocean water displacement which results in strong currents and powerful waves that build in height as they approach the shore.\n\nThe waves radiate in all directions and can travel as fast as a jet plane over deep waters, slowing down as they get to shallower depths.\n\nTsunamis consist of more than one wave that can occur across an extended period of time. The first wave is also not always the biggest—subsequent waves can build in height suddenly and dramatically. Large tsunamis can also continue for days. Japan haswarnedthat tsunamis resulting from the Kamchatka quake may last more than a day.\n\nWhile several countries have issued tsunami forecasts, each tsunami that results from this quake will likely range in severity. The waves that hit Russia’s port town of Severo-Kurilsk had a height of 10-13 ft (3-4 m), while those that hit Japan’s Hokkaido coast were around 12 in (30 cm) to 16 in (40 cm).\n\nTsunamis are also not possible to precisely predict, according to theU.S. National Weather Service. Instead, tsunami warning centers forecast tsunamis based on the size and location of an earthquake that precedes it, as well as forecast models to estimate wave height, location, and arrival times once a tsunami is already detected.\n\nThe NOAA usesDeep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (DART) systemsin partnership with a broader international network of systems to detect, measure, and report in real-time tsunamis in the open ocean by measuring changes in water pressure as a tsunami wave passes.\n\nThe U.S. follows a four-tier system for tsunami alerts. In descending levels of severity, these are: warning, advisory, watch, and information statement, according to theNWS.\n\nPeople should also be alert to visible natural signs of a tsunami, including a loud roar from the ocean and a sudden rise or fall of water levels. A sudden retraction in water from the shoreline is an indication that a tsunami may occur.\n\nA tsunami warning is the highest alert for a tsunami. The NWS says a tsunami warning means: “Take Action—Danger! A tsunami that may cause widespread flooding is expected or occurring. Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents are possible and may continue for several hours or days after initial arrival.”\n\nIn the event of a tsunami warning, people are advised to evacuate immediately and move to high ground and as far inland as possible (at least 100 ft above sea level or one mile inland), and follow the instructions of local authorities. Some areas under threat,such as Hawaii, also open emergency shelters for those evacuating.\n\nWhile people should move to higher ground, most tall buildings are not built to withstand the impact of tsunamis, according to the NWS. If no other option is available, the upper stories of some tall and strong buildings may provide some protection.\n\nIf you are in a boat at sea at the time of a tsunami warning, you should go out to sea to a safe depth, the Department of Homeland Security’sReady.govsays. If you are in a harbor, you should leave your boat and move to a safe area on land.\n\nA tsunami advisory is the second-highest alert level by the NWS. The agency says a tsunami advisory means: “Take Action—A tsunami with potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is expected or occurring. There may be flooding of beach and harbor areas.”\n\nPeople are advised to stay out of the water and away from beaches and waterways, as well as to follow the instructions of local authorities.\n\nAccording to the NWS, a tsunami watch means:“Be Prepared—A distant earthquake has occurred. A tsunami is possible.” In the event of a tsunami watch, people are advised to stay alert for more information and be prepared to take action if it becomes necessary.\n\nA tsunami information statement is the lowest alert level and means: “Relax—An earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away and the threat has not been determined. In most cases, there is no threat of a destructive tsunami.”\n\nFor international partners in the Pacific and Caribbean, the U.S. issues tsunami threats as opposed to alerts. A threat message outlines the potential impact to people, structures, and ecosystems according to the NWS. Other countries then determine what alert to issue.\n\nOther countries also often use tiered alert systems, although they may use different terms for each. People should check their local emergency management systems for any alerts and instructions.For more information from different tsunami warning systems, visittsunami.govor refer to your local weather or emergency management center, such asJapan’s Meteorological AgencyandHawaii’s Emergency Management Agency.\n\nContact usatletters@time.com.",

As of Wednesday morning, more than 75% of the day's flights at Zhoushan were cancelled.\n\nSome train services in the region were temporarily suspended with others operated under restricted speeds, state media said.\n\nShanghai is rarely subject to direct hits from strong typhoons that generally make landfall further south in China. The most significant typhoon in recent years that landed directly in Shanghai was Bebinca last year, the most powerful tropical cyclone to hit China's financial capital since 1949.\n\nThe arrival of Co-May coincided with a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, about 4,000 km (2,500 miles) from Shanghai.\n\nWhile China's National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center said the tsunami was expected to have \"disastrous impacts\" on some parts of China's coast, Shanghai's municipal earthquake agency later discounted potentially \"disastrous impacts.\"\n\nAlthough nearby coastal regions could see water levels rise by up to 180 cm in the evening, tidal waves around the city will not exceed warning levels, Shanghai's marine forecasting centre said, according to state media reports.\n\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh in Shanghai and Xiuhao Chen and Ryan Woo in Beijing; Editing by Tom Hogue, Raju Gopalakrishnan and Bernadette Baum)",

    "News_text":"Oprah Winfreyis facing online backlash following a tsunami warning in Hawaii, where residents are accusing her of not opening aprivate road in Maui. Following an 8.7-magnitude earthquake near Russia, tsunami warnings were issued across the Pacific. This prompted thousands of Maui residents to evacuate the area, causing traffic jams.\n\nHere are more details.\n\nOprah Winfrey is facing widespread criticism on social media after reports emerged that she has allegedly not opened her private road connecting Wailea to Kula, Hawaii, as residents attempt to evacuate during a tsunami alert.\n\nThe backlash follows an 8.7-magnitude earthquake near Russia, which triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including in Hawaii. As thousands of people rushed to flee low-lying areas and move to higher ground, videos began circulating online showing massive traffic congestion throughout parts of Hawaii, particularly on Maui.\n\nAmid the escalating evacuation crisis, several social media users accused Winfrey of refusing to allow public access to her private road. They argued that doing so could have helped ease traffic and expedite evacuations. As images and footage of jammed highways continue to spread online, the criticism against Winfrey has intensified.\n\nOne user wrote onX (formerly Twitter), “If people die while you’re guarding your private road like it’s treasure, that blood is on your hands. Lives matter more than luxury. Open the damn road, Oprah. This is survival, not a red carpet event.”\n\nAnothercommented, “Families are TRAPPED while Oprah sits behind her PRIVATE GATE doing nothing. One open road could save lives…but when it’s time to act, elites always CHOOSE THEMSELVES over the people.” Many critics insist that the private route could have significantly improved conditions during the ongoing crisis.\n\nAs of now, Winfrey has not issued any public comment regarding the situation.\n\nThe postWhy Is Oprah Winfrey Facing Backlash Amid Hawaii Tsunami Alert?appeared first onComingSoon.net - Movie Trailers, TV & Streaming News, and More.",

Known as the Valdivia earthquake or Great Chilean earthquake, the largest ever recorded temblor resulted in more than 1,600 deaths in the country and beyond, most of which were caused by the resulting large tsunami. Thousands of people were injured.\n\nIn 1964, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake jolted Alaska’s Prince William Sound, lasting for almost 5 minutes. More than 130 people were killed in the largest recorded earthquake in the U.S. and subsequent tsunami. There were huge landslides and towering waves that caused severe flooding. The event was followed by thousands of aftershocks for weeks after the initial quake.\n\nA 9.1 magnitudeearthquake and resulting tsunamidevastated Southeast and South Asia and East Africa in 2004, killing 230,000 people. Indonesia alone recorded more than 167,000 deaths as entire communities were wiped out.\n\nA magnitude 9.1 earthquakestruck off the coast of northeastern Japan in 2011, triggering a towering tsunami that smashed into the Fukushima nuclear plant. It knocked out power and cooling systems and triggered meltdowns in three reactors. More than 18,000 people were killed in the quake and tsunami, some of whom have never been recovered.\n\nIn 1952, a magnitude 9.0 quake caused significant damage but no reported deaths despite a tsunami that hit Hawaii with 9.1-meter (30-foot) waves.\n\nA massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit central Chile in 2010, shaking the capital for a minute and half and setting off a tsunami. More than 500 people were killed in the disaster.\n\nIn 1906, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and resulting tsunami killed about 1,500 people. Its effects were felt for miles along the Central American coast and as far as San Francisco and Japan.\n\nIn 1965, a magnitude 8.7 quake struck Alaska’s Rat Islands, causing a 35-foot-high tsunami. There was some relatively minor damage, including cracks in buildings and an asphalt runway.\n\nAt least 780 people were killed when a magnitude 8.6 earthquake struck in 1950. Dozens of villages were destroyed, including at least one that slid into a river. There were also major landslides that jammed the Subansiri River in India. When the water eventually broke through, it resulted in a deadly 23-foot wave.\n\nIn 2012, a powerful 8.6 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of northern Sumatra in Indonesia. Though the quake caused little damage, it increased pressure on a fault that was the source of the devastating 2004 tsunami.",

A wave of 3.6ft was later observed at Crescent City, according to the NWS.\n\nThe stretch of the west coast is currently under a tsunami advisory, from the British Columbia border down to the Mexican border. Alaska’s peninsula is also under an advisory, from Chignik Bay to Attu.\n\nMeanwhile, a red warning is in place for the Oregon\/California border at Cape Mendocino in Humboldt County.\n\nThe NWS urged those located in coastal areas to move off the beach and out of harbours and marinas across the west coast.\n\n\"Do not go to the coast to watch. Be alert to instructions from local officials,\" the weather service added.\n\nEvacuation orders have been issued for large parts of the US west coast with authorities ordering people to \"take action now\" and get away from the sea.\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged people to “STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!” in a post on his Truth Social account, which was also shared on X:\n\n“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii. A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visithttps:\/\/tsunami.govfor the latest information. STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!”\n\nHawaii wasunder a tsunami warning, but this has now been downgradedto an advisory after several waves hit the coastlines of the islands.\n\nFurther up the west coast into Canada, a tsunami advisory has also been issued for most of British Columbia.\n\nThe UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has advised those along the West Coast to follow the guidance of the local authorities.\n\n“An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 8.7 has struck the eastern coast of Russia in the Kamchatka Peninsula region,” the FCDO said in its latest update.\n\n“A tsunami threat message has been issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.\n\n“If you are in the affected areas potentially affected by the earthquake or tsunami you should follow the advice of the local authorities.”\n\nSan Francisco International Airport, the nearest international hub to Crescent City where the largest wave has hit so far, appears to be operating as normal apart from a few cancellations to and from Hawaii.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport also appears to be carrying on as scheduled, apart from cancelled Hawaii journeys, with the islands temporarily grounding flights in some of its airports.\n\nCarriers such as Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have issued a travel waiver for passengers, allowing them to change or cancel their trip amid the tsunami.\n\nAs the Foreign Office has not warned against non-essential travel to the US, there will be no special circumstances in place to be able to cancel a trip for a full refund.\n\nThe conditions for cancelling your trip will be dependent on your holiday provider, so it’s best to contact them if you’re looking to postpone.\n\nThere is no obligation for companies to refund bookings if you want to cancel, and you will not be able to claim on your travel insurance due to safety concerns unless government advice changes.\n\nIf you do have travel insurance, some policies include natural disaster cover for an event that prevents you from reaching your holiday destination.

    "News_text":"The soft glow of moonlight usually guides newly hatched loggerhead sea turtles from the beaches of Georgia’s Little St. Simons Island to the ocean. But massive interstate lights areputting the baby turtles in harm’s way.\n\nHere’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.\n\nAmassive 8.8 magnitude earthquakethat struck off Russia’s far eastern coast on Wednesday local timetriggered tsunami wavesthat coursed across the Pacific. Tsunami advisories and warnings urging millions to move away from coastal zones and seek higher ground were issued in Russia, Japan, the Philippines, Chile, Peru, Indonesia and Ecuador, as well as in Hawaii, Alaska and the US West Coast. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, tsunami waves began reaching Hawaii’s coast in the early evening local time. One wave, reported in Kahului on the north-central shore of Maui island, was over 5 feet high. Smaller waves arrived along the Washington, Oregon and California coastline early this morning; however, dangerous currents and additional surges are possible for hours after the initial waves. So far, minimal damage has been reported.\n\nThe New York Police Department is sending investigators to Las Vegas to learn more about a possible motive for Monday’sdeadly mass shooting in midtown Manhattan. Shane Devon Tamura, 27, left Las Vegas, where he lived, on Saturday and drove to New York City. On Monday evening, he used an assault-style rifle to shoot five people,killing four of them, inside a Park Avenue skyscraper that housed numerous corporate offices, including the NFL. Tamura was later found in a stairwell on the 33rd floor, dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. A suicide note in his pocket expressed grievances with the NFL and alleged that he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a brain disease linked to head trauma. According to sources, Tamura was a competitive football player in his youth. NYC Mayor Eric Adams said investigators believe Tamura was headed for the NFL offices, but took the wrong elevator. The medical examiner’s office said it plans to examine Tamura’s brain for CTE during the autopsy.\n\nSenate Republicansconfirmed Emil Bove, who defended President Donald Trump in his criminal indictments, to a lifetime appointment as a federal appellate judge. Bove’s nomination to the bench for the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals was highly contentious. Several whistleblowers came forward to accuse him of improperly overseeing cases for the Trump administration. Democrats protested by walking out of a vote on his nomination. And more than75 former federal and state judges, both conservative and liberal, called for his nomination to be rejected, saying his “egregious record of mistreating law enforcement officers, abusing power, and disregarding the law itself disqualifies him for this position.” Bove repeatedly rebuffed such claims and a Justice Department spokesman previously told CNN that he “will make an excellent judge.”\n\nThe Trump administration plans todestroy nearly $10 million worth of contraceptivesthat were procured by USAID rather than deliver the supplies to women in need overseas. The contraceptives, which are mostly long-lasting types of birth control such as IUDs and injectables, are currently stored in a warehouse in Belgium. The “preliminary decision” to destroy the family-planning supplies was confirmed by a State Department spokesperson. Doing so will cost $167,000. “They have to double incinerate the products because they contain high levels of hormones and they don’t want to risk leaking the byproducts out in the environment, which likely adds to the cost,” a congressional aide told CNN. “The Trump administration is quite literally burning taxpayer money.”\n\nWhen COP30, the annual UN climate summit, opens in Brazil this November,the US doesn’t plan to have an official presence. The Trump administration has fired all of its climate negotiators and eliminated the State Department’s Office of Global Change. Without the department’s climate staff in place, even Capitol Hill lawmakers who usually attend the summits have been unable to get accredited, a source told CNN. COP30 is expected to be a landmark summit, one that will set the global climate agenda for the next 10 years. While some experts fear the US’ absence from the talks may derail other nations’ climate ambitions, it could also hand a geopolitical advantage to China. “It is likely that China’s voice will be heard more loudly (at COP30), as they haveidentified growth in green technologiesas a key pillar of their economic strategy,” said Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.\n\nIf your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.Sign up here for the ‘5 Things’ newsletter.\n\nThe strapped budget carrier expects toenact major staffing changesto match its downsized schedule.\n\nThe country’s government has decided to include the world’s largest video platformin its social media banfor children under 16.\n\nOzzy Osbourne’s last rideThe “Crazy Train” singer’sfuneral processionwill travel through Birmingham — his hometown in England — today.\n\nThe 76-year-old singer has been in a few car accidents, butnot for the reason many people believe.\n\nThe fourth installment of the “Meet the Parents” film franchise just announcedits catchy new title, cast and release date.\n\n$1 billionThat’show much of a hitProcter & Gamble says its profits will take due to President Trump’s tariffs.

    "News_text":"Tsunamiwaves of up to1.3m have hit areas of Japan’s Pacific coastfollowing a powerful 8.8 magnitudeearthquakein eastern Russia.\n\nAlmost one million residents were told to evacuate coastal areas ahead of the tsunami's arrival. Tsunami alerts have been downgraded across the country’s municipalities; however, tsunami advisories are still in place across much of Japan’s eastern coast.\n\nHawaii, the west coast of theUS, and several other Pacific islands have also been placed under tsunami warnings or advisories following the quake, while damage and evacuations have been reported in the Russian regions nearest the epicentre.\n\nOver in Hawaii,waves reaching 5.6fthave been recorded, whileCalifornia has witnessed a 3.6ftwave breaking on its shoreline.\n\nHere’s what to know if you are travelling in or out of Japan as the tsunami hits the shoreline.\n\nAtsunamihit coastal areas of Russia's Kuril Islands andJapan's large northern island, Hokkaido, after theearthquakestruck early on Wednesday morning (local time).\n\nTsunami advisories are in place along much of Japan’s coastline, while its western coast has an even lower alert over the risk of slight sea level changes.\n\n“As of 8.45pm on the 30th, a tsunami advisory is in effect. Tsunamis may strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or approach the coast until the advisory is lifted,” theJapan Meteorological Agencysaid.\n\nAuthorities in Japan issued an evacuation advisory to more than two million people across 229 municipalities on Wednesday afternoon local time, NHK reported.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said a first tsunami wave of about 30cm reached Nemuro on the eastern coast of Hokkaido.\n\nA 1.3m tsunami was recorded at Kuji Port in Iwate prefecture, while an 80cm wave was observed at Nemuro, Hokkaido. High waves have also been reported in other areas along the coast.\n\nThe earthquake is one of the strongest ever recorded, leaving several people injured in Russia, according to authorities, and at least one person injured in Japan.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has asked British travellers in Japan to follow the guidance of local authorities amid tsunami alerts.\n\n“Following the magnitude 8.8 earthquake off of the eastern coast of Russia, the Japanese Meteorological Agency has issued tsunami warnings of up to three meters along Japan’s Pacific coast from Hokkaido to Wakayama,” theFCDOsaid.\n\n“Please follow the advice of local authorities. For further information in English, please access theNHK website.”\n\nSendai International Airport, which sits on the Pacific coast, said in a recent update: “Due to the issuance of a tsunami warning, all runways have been closed, and both domestic and international flights have been cancelled for the entire day.\n\n“Passengers using aircraft are requested to check the latest flight information on the airline's website or other sources.”\n\nSome local train operations have also been suspended or delayed, while ferries connecting Hokkaido and Aomori on the northern tip of Japan's Honshu island were suspended, as well as those connectingTokyoand nearby islands.\n\nAs the Foreign Office has not warned against non-essential travel to Japan, there will be no special circumstances in place to be able to cancel a trip for a full refund.\n\nThe conditions for cancelling your trip will be dependent on your holiday provider, so it’s best to contact them if you’re looking to postpone.\n\nThere is no obligation for companies to refund bookings if you want to cancel, and you will not be able to claim on your travel insurance due to safety concerns unless government advice changes.\n\nIf you do have travel insurance, some policies include natural disaster cover for an event that prevents you from reaching your holiday destination.

    "News_title":"Tsunami waves reach Hawaii, West Coast hours after magnitude 8.8 earthquake off Russia",
    "News_text":"Tsunami waves reached Hawaiiand the West Coast afterone of the strongest earthquakes in recorded history, a magnitude 8.8 temblor, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 29 before most of the warnings were downgraded hours later.\n\nThe waves began arriving in Hawaii after 7 p.m. local time, but initial observations were heartening to officials bracing for major damage in the state. By 10:45, authorities announced that the Tsunami Warning System had downgraded risk to the state from a tsunami warning to an advisory. There were no major reports of damage.\n\n\"Evacuations canceled for Oahu. Residents may return home,\" state emergency management officials posted on social media July 30. \"Remain cautious in or near the water. Widespread flooding is NOT expected. Stay away from beaches, shorelines, and out of the ocean.\"\n\nTsunami waves began to arrive at Crescent City, California, and Humboldt Bay overnight,the weather service in Eureka posted on X. Tsunamis can cause a long series of waves, extensively flood coastal areas and present dangers that continue for many hours.\n\n\"Tsunami activity is continuing to build this morning as we approach the 4 AM minor high tide,\" the weather service posted July 30 on X. The post said maximum confirmed heights for the coast included 3.6 feet at Crescent City and urged residents to avoid beaches and harbors \"as tsunami activity will persist.\"\n\nCrescent City is located along a stretch of the West Coast under a tsunami warning, an upgraded risk level from the rest of the West Coast. The area is considered more vulnerable to tsunamis than any other part of the West Coast based on previous events, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The waves get amplified in the area and are higher in the city’s harbor than at other locations along the coast.\n\nMeanwhile, along the Washington Coast, tsunami waves began arriving just after midnight local time, according to the Seattle weather service office, but wave height measurements weren't yet available.\n\nInitial tsunami warnings have been cancelled or downgraded in much of Alaska, but an advisory still exists along the state's Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula along an over 1,000-mile stretch from Attu Island to Chignik Bay, according to the National Weather Service in Anchorage as of 2:45 a.m. local time.\n\nCurrents at beaches and harbors, marinas, bays and inlets can be especially dangerous in the wake of tsunami waves and the danger can last for days, forecasters said.\n\nTsunami waves have been recorded at gauges along the Aleutian Islands, with the highest wave of 2.7 feet near Adak Island at about 10:21 p.m. local time on July 29.\n\n“Impacts from Tsunamis may continue for many hours to days after arrival of the first wave,” forecasters said.\n\nThe earthquake was recorded at 7:24 p.m. ET, about 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. The agency stated that the quake was shallow, occurring at a depth of approximately 12 miles.\n\nA wall collapsed in a kindergarten in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, but there were no casualties, the Russian news agency Tass reported. Elsewhere, several people sought medical assistance, Tass said. And a tsunami wave made landfall on the coast near Severo-Kurilsk, the government of the Sakhalin Region told Tass.\n\nThe United States is served by two tsunami centers operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center serves the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific and Caribbean territories and the British Virgin Islands. It also covers the international forecast for nations in the Pacific and Caribbean Basins. It’s located on Hawaii’s Ford Island, on the south side of Oahu near Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe other, the National Tsunami Warning Center, serves the mainland United States, Alaska and Canada. The warning centers are staffed 24\/7 to monitor for tsunamis or earthquakes that could cause them, issue tsunami messages and work to improve warnings.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center was first established in the wake of official tsunami warnings that began in 1949, in response to a 1946 tsunami that devastated Hilo, Hawaii, known as the April Fools Day Tsunami.\n\nShortly before 11:30 p.m. ET, a tsunami advisory was upgraded to a warning for the coastal areas of California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon-California border, the weather service said.A tsunami warningmeans significant inundation is possible.\n\nEarlier in the night, President Donald Trump took to social media to warn of the tsunami.\n\n\"Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,\" he posted on X. \"... STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"\n\nMost areas along the U.S. Pacific Coast can expect a tsunami of less than 1 foot, the National Weather Service said just after 10:30 p.m. E.T. But even a tsunami of that size can generate deadly currents, the weather service warned.\n\nWhat is a tsunami warning?What to know after huge earthquake.\n\nAfter authorities urged residents and tourists to move to higher ground and evacuate from coastal zones, initial data showed waves arriving on the evening of July 29 were less than the potential projected maximum of 9.8 feet.\n\nTsunami waves in Hawaii reached amplitudes of up to 5.7 feet in Kahului, Maui, a measurement that compares the wave to height above normal sea level, the weather service said. In Hilo, the wave amplitude reached 4.9 feet.\n\n\"Look, everything has been OK so far. We haven't seen a big wave,\" Green said at around 8:30 p.m. But he said officials were concerned about an earlier pullback of water, which can signal a tsunami risk.\n\nContext:Hawaii has a long history with tsunamis, thanks to the 'ring of fire'\n\nThe state of Hawaii is one of the more tsunami susceptible spots in the world, thanks to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by the infamous seismic activity known as the \"ring of fire.\"\n\nTsunami waves can arrive in the islands from any location around the ocean, including Russia, South America and Alaska and the Aleutian Islands,according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. On average, Hawaii experiences destructive tsunamis about once every 11 years.\n\nThe earliest historical accounts emerge from oral histories of the islands, includinga 16th century chantabout a wave that struck the coast of Molokai'i.\n\nRead more:Hawaii has a long history with tsunamis, thanks to the 'ring of fire'\n\nA tsunami warning was issued for Hawaii, according to the state's Department of Emergency Management. The agency estimated that the first tsunami wave will arrive at around 7:17 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.\n\n\"A tsunami has been generated that could cause damage along coastlines of all islands in the state of Hawaii,\" the agency said in a bulletin. \"Urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property.\"\n\nThe Honolulu Department of Emergency Management called for the evacuation of some coastal areas in Hawaii. \"Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,\" the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said onX.\n\nIn a video update at 5:50 p.m. local time, Green said authorities were prepared and noted that county officials were “fully involved” in emergency management. The governor warned residents and visitors to not be outside on all shorelines when the wave strikes, adding that warning sirens will be used within the next hour.\n\n“(The earthquake has) caused a wave we believe that will be significant,” Green said. “People need to evacuate — that’s very clear. They have to be out of the evacuation zone or up four stories.”\n\nShortly after the initial tsunami warning sirens went off at around 3 p.m. local time in Hawaii, the streets of Honolulu, including the tourist hub Waikiki, were congested as people quickly tried to move to higher ground and away from coastal evacuation zones. Some reported long lines at gas stations, as sirens continued to go off on the hour to the estimated first wave.\n\nOahu local Megan Lee said she hit more traffic than usual on her commute home from work. “It’s nice to see everyone taking it seriously,” Lee told USA TODAY. “It’s always scary to get an alert like that.”\n\nSome felt desensitized to the warning following the 2018false missile alert, when residents woke up to an emergency alert notification that a ballistic missle was headed their way. Residents across the islands scrambled to find shelter before learning it was sent as an error.\n\nLee, who was living on Oahu during the false missile alert, said she feels desensitized to these types of warnings. “It makes me not take the sirens as seriously, unfortunately,” she said. “We get a lot of alarms in Hawaii, and you see people going surfing because there’s a tsunami warning.”\n\nThose living more inland said they’re not as concerned about the warning, like Honolulu resident Julie Shimer. “I think it’s great (the state) is being more cautious,” Shimer told USA TODAY. “It’s always better being more prepared just in case.”\n\nIn a statement sent on the afternoon of July 29, Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said, “Residents and visitors are urged to monitor local media for updates and stay away from the coastline. For those flying in or out of Hawaii today please check with your airline for the status of your flight.”\n\n— Kathleen Wong\n\nIn San Diego County, officials were monitoring the situation on the evening of July 29. San Diego County spokesperson Chuck Westerheide said the county would issue an alert if necessary, but stressed that so far, a tsunami advisory was all that was in place.\n\n“As of 8:08 p.m. (local time) we are in an advisory area, meaning strong currents and a tsunami are possible and waves and currents can kill or injure people who are in the water,” Westerheide said. “But that’s key — people who areinthe water.”\n\n“Currents at beaches in harbors, marinas, bays and inlets may be especially dangerous,” he added.\n\nIlya Zaides, who lives on the beach in La Jolla, said he was monitoring X while also waiting to see if an official alert would be issued.\n\n“We’re going to wait and see if there’s an alert, and hopefully there will be enough time to leave if we need to,” Zaides said.\n\n— Will Carless\n\nThe tsunami warning for Alaska includes coastal areas from Attu to Samalga Pass. The tsunami advisory has been expanded to areas from Samalga Pass to Chignik Bay. Expected tsunami start times in Alaska include the following: 6:45 p.m., Unalaska; 7:25 p.m., Sand Point and 8:00 p.m. Cold Bay.\n\nThe National Tsunami Warning Center advises that tsunami activity is possible at Shemya, Alaska beginning at 4:46 p.m., Alaskan Daylight Time, then at 5:46 p.m. at Adak and 7:06 p.m. at Saint Paul, about 760 miles west of Anchorage.\n\nA buoy south-southwest of Attu, Alaska detected a tsunami wave of 3 feet, the weather service reported. The measurements from DART buoys are from the deep ocean and are generally much smaller than the wave would be when it arrives at the coast, the weather service said.\n\nTsunami alerts issued in the U.S.Here's where.\n\nIn San Francisco and Monterey, California, the weather service expects to see tsunami heights of less than one feet, but advises it could present strong and hazardous currents.\n\n\"Move off the beach and out of harbors and marinas,\" the weather service said. \"Do not go to the coast to watch the tsunami.\"\n\nIn San Diego, the weather service said the area should not expect widespread inundation, but advised people in coastal areas under the advisory to stay off the beach and out of harbors and marinas.\n\n\"Dangerous and powerful currents are still expected within the ocean and along the coast,\" said Dial Hoang, a weather service meteorologist in San Francisco. \"In 2011, a man near Crescent City died after he was swept out to sea while trying to photograph the tsunami coming in.\"\n\nThe highest peak wave is forecast for Crescent City, California, where the height could peak at between 2.9 feet and 5.4 feet, with tsunami waves lasting for 36 hours. In Port San Luis, California, the waves could peak at 2 to 3.8 feet and last for 24 hours, the weather service warned.\n\nPossible tsunami start times stretch from 8:20 p.m. local time in Kodiak, Alaska, southward along the coast to La Jolla, California, where tsunami activity would be expected to begin by 1:15 a.m. local time.\n\nEstimated tsunami start times, in local times, for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska: Kodiak - 8:20 p.m., Seward - 8:45 p.m., Sitka - 8:55 p.m., Homer - 9:40 p.m., and Craig - 9:55 p.m.\n\nBritish Columbia: Langara - 10:05 p.m. and Tofino - 11:30 p.m.\n\nWashington state: La Push - 11:35 p.m., Port Angeles - 12:20 a.m. on July 30, Port Townsend - 12:45 a.m. on July 30, and Bellingham - 1:10 a.m. on July 30\n\nOregon: Port Oxford - 11:40 p.m., Charleston - 11:45 p.m., Brookings - 11:50 p.m., Seaside - 11:55 p.m., and Newport - 11:55 p.m.\n\nCalifornia: Fort Bragg - 11:50 p.m., Monterey - 12:15 a.m. on July 30, San Francisco - 12:40 a.m. on July 30, Los Angeles Harbor - 1:05 a.m. on July 30, and La Jolla - 1:15 a.m. on July 30\n\nAlong the West Coast, the weather service warned after 10 p.m. ET that widespread inundation is not expected in most locations. The weather service office in Seattle, Washington has advised that the tsunami waves are expected to arrive on the coast at Moclips at 11:50 p.m. and last for nine hours. The forecast peak of the highest wave is .8 to 1.4 feet, the weather service said.\n\n\"This is a significant, real event,\" said Reid Wolcott, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle. \"The imminent threat is for Alaska and areas near the quake. The National Tsunami Warning Center needs additional observation information before more is known about the threat to the US West Coast.\"\n\nIt will take time for ocean buoys and other observations to come in so that the tsunami warning centers can make a forecast with real data, Wolcott said.\n\nThough the peak of the tsunami could be less than a foot, the weather service has warned that it could still be dangerous. Estimated wave heights for selected sites are:\n\nAlaska: Adak - 1.2 to 2.2 feet; and Unalaska, Saint Paul, Sand Point, and Cold Bay are all less than 1 foot.\n\nBritish Columbia: Langara and Tofino are less than 1 foot\n\nOregon: Port Orford - 1 to 1.8 feet, Charleston - less than 1 foot, and Brookings - 0.8 to 1.5 feet\n\nWashington state: Moclips - 0.7 to 1.3 feet; and Neah Bay, Long Beach, Westport, Port Angeles, Port Townsend, and Bellingham are all less than 1 foot.\n\nCalifornia: Fort Bragg - 0.8 to 1.4 feet; Crescent City - 2.9 to 5.4 feet; Santa Barbara, 0.7- 1.3 feet; and Monterey, San Francisco, Los Angeles Harbor, Newport Beach, and La Jolla are all less than 1 foot.\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists said they are monitoring the \"developing tsunami threat that may impact coastal areas of Hawaii, Alaska, and the western United States.\"\n\n“Any earthquake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 poses a tsunami risk, even thousands of miles away from the epicenter,” said AccuWeather Vice President of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin. “The force of water from tsunamis is incredibly violent and destructive.”\n\nPreliminary data currently indicates that strong currents, wave surges, and possible inundation in low-lying areas are possible in areas where tsunami warnings have been issued, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"This earthquake is likely to be in the top 10 strongest ever recorded. The strongest was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, which was 9.4-9.6 magnitude. The March 2011 earthquake that triggered the tsunami which devastated parts of Japan was a 9.0-9.1 magnitude,” DePodwin added. “Although not all major earthquakes lead to tsunamis, the risk must be taken seriously until the threat has passed.\"\n\nDePodwin noted that a tsunami would not reach Hawaii for at least several hours and advised the public to follow guidelines from local emergency officials.\n\nThe Japan Weather Agency upgraded its warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 10 feet to reach large coastal areas starting around 10:00 a.m. local time. Much of Japan's eastern seaboard, which was devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011, was ordered to evacuate.\n\nTsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan's Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.\n\nThe U.S. Tsunami Warning System also issued a warning of \"hazardous tsunami waves\" within the next three hours along some coasts of Russia, Japan and Hawaii. A tsunami watch was also in effect for the U.S. island territory of Guam and other islands of Micronesia.\n\nIn Guam, the weather service is warning of sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents that could be a hazard along beaches and in harbors. The weather service has advised people to get out of the ocean and move away from beaches and harbors, following the instructions of local government officials. The estimated time of the activity in Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan is 2:37 p.m. local time.\n\nA tsunami advisory is in effect for American Samoa, where hazardous sea level fluctuations and strong ocean currents could occur beginning at 9:39 p.m. local time. Tsunami alerts also are in effect along the coast of Central and South America.\n\nVolcanoes are turning in their sleep:What does that mean for Washington?\n\nThe powerful earthquake generated a tsunami of up to 13 feet in Russia, prompting evacuations and damaging buildings, officials said.\n\n\"Today's earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,\" Kamchatka Gov. Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters.\n\nMultiple aftershocks were also recorded following the major quake, ranging between a magnitude of 5.2 and 6.9, according to the USGS. Kamchatka and Russia's Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nRussia's Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The area was evacuated.\n\nWhile a kindergarten was also damaged, no serious injuries or fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tsunami messages are issued by the tsunami warning centers to alert local authorities and the public of a possible tsunami. There are four levels of tsunami alerts, according to the weather service:\n\nTsunami Warning: \"Take Action—Danger! A tsunami that may cause widespread flooding is expected or occurring. Dangerous coastal flooding and powerful currents are possible and may continue for several hours or days after initial arrival.\"\n\nTsunami Advisory: \"Take Action—A tsunami with potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is expected or occurring. There may be flooding of beach and harbor areas.\"\n\nTsunami Watch: \"Be Prepared—A distant earthquake has occurred. A tsunami is possible.\"\n\nTsunami Information Statement: \"Relax—An earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away and the threat has not been determined. In most cases, there is no threat of a destructive tsunami.\"\n\nA real-time tsunami monitoring system created by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Washington placed buoys at strategic locations throughout the ocean and they play a critical role in tsunami forecasting, according to the NOAA. The buoys are named DART, for Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis.\n\nWhen a tsunami event occurs, the first information available is the seismic information from the preceding earthquake, according to NOAA. As the tsunami wave moves across the ocean, it reaches the DART systems, which report sea level information measurements to the Tsunami Warning Centers. That buoy data is used to refine estimates of the tsunami source and to make the forecasts for watches, warnings and evacuations.\n\nThe Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory is working on a third generation of the buoy system, but the laboratory isone of those proposed to be closed under the budget NOAAhas proposed for the coming year.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post:Tsunami waves reach Hawaii, West Coast after earthquake off Russia",

    "News_text":"One of the strongestearthquakesever recorded struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula July 29.\n\nThe 8.8 magnitude quake promptedtsunami warningsacross the Pacific, including Alaska, Hawaii and the entire U.S. West Coast.\n\nIn Hawaii, authorities urged residents and tourists to move to evacuate from coastal zones. Initial data showed waves were less than the potential projected maximum of 9.8 feet, with some of the highest seen 5.7 feet in Kahului, Maui.\n\nWhile Florida is surrounded by water,tsunamis are possible but extremely rare, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\nTheearthquakethat struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on July 29 is among the 10 largest ever recorded on the planet.\n\nTheU.S. Geological Surveysaid the quake occurred at 7:24 p.m. ET, about 78 miles east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russia.\n\nIt measured a magnitude of 8.8 and was followed by several aftershocks ranging from 5.2 to 6.9.\n\nIt was theeighth strongest earthquake ever recorded, tied with the 1965 earthquake that occurred in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.\n\nAfter the earthquake, tsunami watches and warnings were issued along the Pacific coast, including for the U.S. west coast, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nResidents in Hawaii were encouraged to evacuate coastal areas and head to higher ground.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, initial reports showed waves Tuesday night were less than the potential projected maximum of 9.8 feet. Some of the highest were5.7 feet in Kahului, Maui.\n\n\"A tsunami is aseries of ocean wavescaused by an underwater earthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption that sends surges of water onto land, sometimes reaching heights of over 100 feet,\" according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. \"These walls of water can cause widespread destruction when they crash ashore. Where the ocean is deep, tsunamis can travel unnoticed on the surface at speeds up to 500 miles an hour, crossing an ocean in a day or less.\"\n\nThe most frequent and destructive tsunamis to affect the U.S. have occurred along the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii.\n\n\"Due to thelack of seismic activity near Florida, there is a low chance that a tsunami will threaten our coastline. However, it is not impossible,\" according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Landslide-generated tsunamis pose a greater threatin the Atlantic Ocean\" for Florida, especially in the Canary Islands and along the slopes of the western Great Bahama Bank.\n\nModels have shown landslides in those areas \"could generate dangerous ocean currents and possiblyhazardous tsunami waves along the east coast of Florida.Coastal communities, especially those on barrier islands, are most vulnerable to impacts of a tsunami event.\"\n\nAccording to NOAA and USGS'National Tsunami Hazard Assessment, there have been four reported tsunami events in Florida. All four occurred on the Atlantic Coast:\n\nOne was caused by an Atlantic Coast earthquake\n\nOne was caused by a non-Atlantic earthquake\n\nTwo were caused by a Caribbean earthquake\n\n\"While no known tsunamis have ever affected the Florida Gulf Coast, a tsunami in that location is not impossible,\" according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\n\"While tsunamis have historically affected the Caribbean many times, it is unlikely that those tsunamis will also affect Florida.\"\n\n\"While it wasn’t officially a “tsunami,” a large rogue wave suddenly appeared along the coast in the Daytona area on July 7, 1992. The wave was reportedly about 10 feet above normal waves and stretched 27 miles long, from Ormond Beach to New Smyrna Beach.\n\n\"There was one death, over 75 people injured, and damage to about 100 cars parked near the coastline. The best theory is that the wave was caused by winds from a storm front.\"\n\n\"Another rogue wave event took place in 1995 spanning from Tampa to Naples.\n\n\"Unlike tsunamis that are triggered by seismic activity,meteotsunamisare driven by air-pressure disturbances often associated withfast-moving weather events,such as severe thunderstorms, squalls, and other storm fronts,\" according to NOAA.\n\nThe storm generates a wave that moves toward the shore and is amplified by a shallow continental shelf and inlet, bay, or other coastal features. Most meteotsunamis, which make up about 20% of tsunamis, are small and mostly go unnoticed.\n\nIn June 2023,Clearwater Beach was hit by a meteotsunamifrom the Gulf of Mexico, although people on the beach probably didn't notice it. Southwest Florida sawwater levels jump up a footin 2018 andwaves over seven feetwere recorded off the coast of Naples in 2016.\n\nA9-foot wave hit Daytona Beachin July 1992, injuring 75 people and damaging property.

    "News_text":"A powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula early Wednesday, triggering tsunami warnings for parts of Japan, Alaska and Hawaii, with alerts also issued for the United States West Coast and Guam.\n\nTheU.S. Geological Survey saidthe quake struck around 8:25 a.m. Japan time, about 85 miles off the Kamchatka coast, at a depth of nearly 12 miles. It was followed by aftershocks of 6.3 and 6.9 magnitude.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centerconfirmed a tsunami had been generated, warning of potentially destructive waves.\n\n\"This is the most serious warning that you can have,\" Hawaii Governor Josh Green, M.D. said. \"It is not a watch. It is a warning. Which means we have to evacuate the coastal zones right away.\"\n\nSirens blared in Hawaii's capital on Tuesday evening and people posted videos of the gridlock on Honolulu streets as thousands rushed to evacuate.\n\n\"Any earthquake with a magnitude greater than 7.0 poses a tsunami risk even thousands of miles away from the epicenter,\" Dan DePodwin, AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecasting Operations, said.\n\nTsunami waves led to a maximum height of 3.1 feet at Midway Island in the North Pacific Ocean. Wave activity began in Hawaii around 1-1:30 a.m. EDT with a 5.7-foot wave at Kahului and 4.9 feet measured in Hilo. Waves have subsided, though dangerous currents may persist through Wednesday night.\n\nAround 6:00 a.m. EDT, the Oahua Department of Emergency Managagement said the Tsunami Warning was downgraded to Tsunami Advisory. \"Evacuations canceled for Oahu. Residents may return home. Remain cautious in or near the water. Widespread flooding is NOT expected. Stay away from beaches, shorelines, and out of the ocean,\" the agencyposted on X.\n\nOn the U.S. West Coast, waves reached Monterey Bay around 4 a.m. EDT, peaking at a 1.1-foot surge there and 3.6 feet in Crescent City. Authorities closed some of California's beaches, docks and harbors, warning of strong and dangerous currents.\n\nA tsunami warning is still in effect for a portion of Northern California's coast. Hawaii, South of Fortuna, California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska's Aleutian Islands and the U.S. territory of Guam are under a tsunami advisory.\n\nA tsunami happens when an earthquake shifts the ocean floor, pushing a massive column of water up or down. This sudden movement sends waves racing outward. If the quake is strong enough-usually magnitude 7.0 or higher-and close to the surface, the resulting tsunami can bring water surging onto coastlines, rising quickly and posing serious danger to anyone nearby.\n\n\"Although not all major earthquakes lead to tsunamis, the risk must be taken seriously until the threat has passed,\" DePodwin explained, adding that \"AccuWeather rapidly pushes all official National Tsunami Warning Center watches and warnings to users of the AccuWeather mobile app.\"\n\nThis earthquake is likely to be in the top 10 strongest ever recorded. The strongest was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, which was 9.4-9.6 magnitude. The 2011 earthquake that triggered the tsunami, which devastated parts of Japan, was a 9.0-9.1 magnitude.",

    "News_title":"How to stay safe from a tsunami",
    "News_text":"Tsunami waves have struck the US, Japan and Russia after one of the biggest ever earthquakes struck deep in the Pacific.\n\nMillions of residents in these countries received mobile or television alerts ordering them to evacuate following the 8.8-magnitude earthquake, which struck near Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula at 11.25am local time (00.25am BST).\n\nFootage shows waves causing destruction in parts of Russia, although Hawaii has downgraded its tsunami alert to an advisory level.\n\nThese days public information tsunami alerts are quick, concise and effective, but it is always worth knowing the main signs of an incoming tsunami, and the action to take in such a scenario.\n\nAcross the world, meteorological agencies and tsunami warning centres are on-hand to analyse tsunami threats and to issue emergency alerts if necessary. These alerts take various forms.\n\nThese days, the quickest way to inform the population is via a mobile phone push notification or alarm which can override silent mode.\n\nIn some coastal areas (including in Japan, Hawaii, Alaska and parts of Washington State), loudspeakers and sirens alert citizens of an incoming threat. In instances of a major tsunami alert, TV and radio programming will be interrupted to issue information and advice.\n\nEmergency updates will also be posted on social media channels including X, Facebook and Instagram, and across local government websites, such asFEMA(US) and theJapan Meteorological Agency.\n\nThe first sign of a tsunami is likely to be a very intense or long earthquake. If you are near the coast, you may see a sudden rise or fall of sea level. Be alert for the ocean receding very quickly, revealing reefs, rocks and fauna on the sea bed.\n\nTsunami survivors have also reported a very loud “roaring” sound, similar to a plane or a train, coming from the direction of the ocean.\n\nThe most likely first sign of a tsunami is an earthquake. In this instance, the advice onready.govis to “drop, cover and hold on”. When the shaking stops, you must then look out for signs and alerts for a tsunami and take action.\n\nAll tsunami advisory agencies recommend moving inland or to higher ground if you recognise any tsunami signs (see above).\n\nIf getting to higher ground is not possible, UNESCO’s Tsunami Programme advises to head to a higher floor of a building (at least a third storey): aerial footage shared this morning from Hokkaido, Japan shows people gathered on top of a skyscraper for this very reason.\n\nAs a last resort, UNESCO advises to climb a tree, and to find something that could be used as a raft in case you are swept up by a tsunami.\n\nDo not wait for an official warning. If you feel the signs of a tsunami, as outlined above, take action immediately as the waves might hit land before an emergency alert is issued.\n\nHowever tempting it may be, do not go to the shore to see if you can detect the tsunami coming in. And all advice suggests you should remain in your safe zone even after an initial wave has hit: tsunamis are never just one wave. Many people die not from a first wave, but by being off guard when there are later surges.\n\nTsunamis begin with a large displacement of water, usually caused by a powerful undersea earthquake or a volcanic eruption.\n\nAfter the initial displacement of water, waves moved outwards in all directions from the epicentre. These waves can move faster than a plane, at speeds of up to 500mph, and can be more than 100 miles wide.\n\nJust before the tsunami waves hit land, the decreasing depth acts as a brake and the waves slow down to 20 or 30mph. They compress, grow taller (from 30ft to as high as 100ft), and will either hit land as a crashing wall of water or a rapid surge.\n\nOnce a major tsunami hits land, it can travel for miles inland. It will flood the land, with the ability to uproot trees, destroy buildings, carry cars and topple bridges. After the initial wave recedes, several more will typically hit. Sometimes these follow-on surges can be even bigger and more powerful than the first.\n\nTsunami waves aren’t felt in the open ocean where waters are deeper than 100m. If you are far out at sea, the advice is to avoid attempting to return to port. The biggest risk zone in a tsunami is the more shallow waters nearer to coastlines.\n\nIf you are very close to the shore, the advice is to head to land immediately, abandon the boat and head to high ground, if possible. If this is not possible, the advice is to head out to deeper water if it is safe to do so. It is wise to avoid bridges and narrow infrastructure during a tsunami, as these can collapse.\n\nIf you are on a cruise ship, be aware of the safe zones on the ship and wait for the advice of the captain.\n\nThe aviation industry typically reacts fast to a tsunami alert. During the latest incident, Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines paused flights as a precaution. Affected passengers will be given the option to reschedule their flight or to use credit to buy a new plane ticket.\n\nAfter a tsunami, survivors are advised to be on high alert of the risk of electrocution, as downed power lines can electrically charge water. It is recommended that you limit phone calls to emergencies and to use messaging services to contact loved ones, instead.\n\nOtherwise, stay away from damaged buildings and roads, seek medical attention if required, and listen to local alerts for further information. In the longer term, disease and water contamination are a risk in tsunami-affected areas.\n\nThe websiteready.govadvises to be clued up on community evacuation plans. In some areas, there will be established evacuation routes and shelters. It is also recommended to create a family plan on where to meet, if separated, and to sign up to local warning systems.\n\nThe most at-risk areas are less than 7m above sea level and within 1.24 miles (2km) from the shoreline.\n\nGlobally, the countries most at risk of tsunamis are the ones gathered around the Pacific Ring of Fire, an enormous belt (more a horseshoe than a ring) of active volcanoes that fringes much of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe at-risk countries in this area are the USA, Russia, and Japan, plus Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Solomon Islands, Chile, New Zealand, Guatemala, Canada and Mexico.\n\nAny coastal area affected by earthquakes could be at tsunami risk. The 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake, which took the lives of an estimated 227,898 people across 14 countries, had its epicentre off the coast of Indonesia and a magnitude of 9.2–9.3. This was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history, and the worst tsunami on record.\n\nThere are countless case studies of people surviving the 2004 tsunami. One survivor, Ani Naqvi,recounts what happened when her hut in Sri Lanka was overwhelmed with a water surge.\n\n“I was lucky enough to be thrown into the path of a tree – and though I was winded, I was able to hold on. As much as the water was trying to rip me away at what felt like hundreds of miles per hour, I wouldn’t let go.\n\n“Incredibly, I managed to spot my friends in the distance, and tried to move towards them. The ground was covered in debris and broken glass, and everywhere there was death.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, promptingtsunami warningsin coastal towns in multiple countries.\n\nThe earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"\n\nBoxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"\n\nTwo magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in2011 in Japanand the2004 Sumatra earthquakein Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.\n\nEarthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.\n\nWhile a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 … in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.\n\n\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"\n\nNational Tsunami Warning Center Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.\n\n\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"\n\nWatch: Hawaii Gov.

    "News_title":"New research uncovers major issue with tsunami warning systems: 'It's not a matter of if, but when'",
    "News_text":"Tsunami warning systems have seen significant advancements with the development of new technologies. However, there seem to be limitations in these systems.\n\nResearchers from the University of Western Ontariofoundthat machine learning and advanced decision-making tools could improve how quickly and accurately warnings are issued.\n\nThe study,publishedin the Coastal Engineering Journal, suggests that more advanced artificial intelligence models can improve tsunami warnings — provided they're trained on high-quality, real-world data.\n\nThe researchers built tsunami warning models using three different methods: multiple linear regression, random forest, and neural network. The last two methods worked better, but the quality of data used to train the models made a significant difference in the accuracy of their predictions.\n\nIf the training data doesn't reflect real-world conditions, the model may not perform accurately even if it ran well during standard tests. And that's the key challenge. Not all tsunami-prone areas have real-world data. For instance, there are only four ocean-bottom sensors on the west coast of Canada.\n\nIn Tofino, a popular surfing destination on Vancouver Island, this lack of data poses a huge problem in predicting tsunamis. Although no tsunami has ever hit the town, its topography puts it at a high risk for a huge tsunami.\n\nBeneath the waters near Tofino is a tectonic plate boundary whose movement can produce a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. One big jolt from the Cascadia Subduction Zone could trigger a tsunami up to 30 meters high, capable of reaching the shoreline within 20 minutes.\n\nThe researchers still don't know how large the tsunami might be, but they're certain that it will happen. \"It's not a matter of if, but when,\" said Katsu Goda, a University of Western Ontario associate professor and Canada Research Chair in multi-hazard risk assessment, per Phys.org.\n\nAround the globe, researchers are doubling down on technology that can help predict and mitigate the impact of natural disasters.\n\nOne team has developed a new model to improve the predictions of tsunamis and help address deadly storm surges. Another is developing a futuristic, self-powered seawall that protects against tsunami waves and transforms tidal water movement into electricity.\n\nDo you think our power grid needs to be upgraded?\n\nDefinitely\n\nOnly in some states\n\nNot really\n\nI'm not sure\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nResearchers are also developing artificial intelligence-powered flood vision to predict how flooding from rising seas and severe storms could impact local communities, helping people visualize risks and prepare in advance before the impacts of nature become severe.\n\nThere's still too much uncertainty involved in predicting tsunamis, but these developments represent important progress toward more accurate warning systems that can give people more time to evacuate, save lives, and protect infrastructure andecosystems.\n\nIn the meantime, staying informed oncritical climate issuescan help boost awareness and preparedness for calamities.\n\nJoin ourfree newsletterfor weekly updates on the latest innovationsimproving our livesandshaping our future, and don't missthis cool listof easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

In many regions, tsunami warnings were lifted or downgraded.\n\nThe main quake, which hit at about 11:24 am on Wednesday (2324 GMT Tuesday), was recorded by the US Geological Survey (USGS) at magnitude 8.8 - the strongest globally since Japan's Fukushima disaster in March 2011, and one of the six most powerful earthquakes ever measured. Russian authorities reported a magnitude of 8.7.\n\nAccording to the Russian Academy of Sciences, it was the strongest earthquake to hit Kamchatka since 1952.

    "News_title":"Hawaii downgrades tsunami warning",
    "News_text":"Hawaii lifted an evacuation order Wednesday morning afterbeing struck by wavesfrom a tsunami following an8.8 magnitude earthquakeoff the coast of Russia.\n\nThe earthquake sent shockwaves through Japan, Hawaii and the West Coast of the U.S. An advisory order remains in place for the islands, warning local residents to take heed of harsher winds and rip currents in the ocean.\n\n“A tsunami is not just one wave. It’s a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour — as fast as a jet airplane — in deep water,” Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska,toldThe Associated Press.\n\n“But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that’s where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there,” he added.\n\nThe Department of Transportation canceled all flights to and from Maui on Tuesday as Hilo International Airport was also closed and baggage operations at the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport were temporarily suspended.\n\nAlthough the Hawaii evacuation order has been lifted, authorities are encouraging those returning to remain vigilant.\n\n“As you return home, still stay off the beach and stay out of the water,” said James Barros, administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, per the AP.\n\nBlack Hawk helicopter crews were activated by Gov. Josh Green (D-Hawaii) to ensure vehicles were prepared to rescue any individuals caught in the water.\n\nHowever, Hawaii was not the only U.S. state impacted by the Russian earthquake. Northern California saw waves up to 5.7 feet while water reached a foot above tide level in Alaska, the news wire reported.\n\nSeattle also felt rougher currents due to the aftershock of the earthquake.\n\n“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii. A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way,” President Trumpwrote late Tuesdayin a post on Truth Social.\n\nHe added, “Please visittsunami.gov\/for the latest information.

    "News_title":"Few will remember this earthquake, but something far worse is looming",
    "News_text":"The Kamchatka Peninsula earthquakemay not have brought the same devastation as previous shocks, but a far more deadly seismic event is looming for the US West Coast.\n\nA major 600-mile-long fault line known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone runs from northern Vancouver Island in Canada to Cape Mendocino in northern California.\n\nScientists have predicted there is a 15 per cent chance of a major earthquake there in the next 50 years, which could bring amega-tsunamihundreds of feet high to US coastlines.\n\nA study from Virginia Tech in April showed an earthquake of force eight or above could cause coastal land to sink 6.5 feet within minutes, devastating cities such as Seattle and Portland and flooding hundreds of miles of roadway, airports, schools, hospitals and power plants.\n\nResearchers determined that the most severe effects would hit densely populated areas in northern California, southern Washington and northern Oregon.\n\nLike the Kamchatka quake, the Cascadia fault line lies in the “Pacific Ring of Fire” – a 25,000-mile horseshoe of 452 volcanoes which stretches from the southern tip of South America, along the coast of North America, across the Bering Strait,Japanand New Zealand.\n\nThe ring produces around 90 per cent of the world’s earthquakes.\n\nBill McGuire, the Professor Emeritus of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at University College London, said: “Along with many active volcanoes, great earthquakes are a feature of the so-called Ring of Fire, each one releasing strain that has accumulated over centuries, as an over-riding tectonic plate snags on the one below, and eventually lets go.”\n\nEarthquakes only rarely cause mass devastation because they tend to occur away from major populations, he said, adding: “Although locally destructive, tsunami heights at remote locations such as Hawaii and Japan seem modest, so widespread devastation and loss of life is unlikely.”\n\nThe last great earthquake in the Cascadia subduction zone happened on Jan 26 1700, and geological evidence shows it caused dramatic land subsidence and drowned coastal marshes across the Pacific Northwest.\n\nGeologic evidence from the last six to seven thousand years indicates that 11 great earthquakes have happened approximately every 200 to 800 years, meaning “the big one” may be imminent.\n\n“This is not a distant or abstract threat,” said Tina Dura, the study’s lead author and assistant professor in Virginia Tech’s Department of Geosciences.\n\n“The probability of a great earthquake is growing, and climate change is compounding the risks. We must factor these compound hazards into long-term planning now.”\n\nEarthquakesare now measured on the Moment Magnitude Scale, which is a modern development of the Richter scale, and records the amount of ground shaking and the amount of seismic energy released. The bigger the number, the worse it is.\n\nThe biggest earthquake ever recorded was of magnitude 9.5 and occurred in Chile in 1960, at a fault line where the Pacific plate dives under the South American plate.\n\nIt submerged an entire pine forest and farms, converting them to tidal marshes, and flooded coastal towns, killing thousands and forcing residents to abandon their homes.\n\nEarthquakes are unlikely to get much bigger because there are no fault lines on Earth large enough to generate more force. Some doubt that a magnitude ten quake could ever occur, and it would take a force 11 for true global devastation.\n\nThe earthquake that struck Kamchatka Peninsula was measured at 8.8 and is the largest to have occurred worldwide since the force 9.1 Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011.\n\nIt was powerful enough to send waves as fast as commercial jets across the Pacific and there have been at least 50 aftershocks up to a force 6.9 which will fuel the surge.\n\nLisa McNeill, a professor of tectonics at the University of Southampton, said: “Some fault movements don’t move the seafloor much and so there is no tsunami. In the case of this earthquake, it had a very large rupture and slip, which made the earthquake large, and so a tsunami was generated.\n\n“The waves travel across the ocean - they are small at sea but travelling fast and it is when they reach shallow water that they build in height again.”\n\nThe earthquake occurred in a subduction zone where two tectonic plates meet, beneath the Kamchatka Peninsula, a huge piece of land which juts down out from the north eastern tip ofRussia.\n\nHere the Pacific plate is moving in a roughly north-westerly direction about three inches a year and being forced beneath the Okhotsk plate.\n\nThe area has had large earthquakes in the past, including a very large 9.1 earthquake in 1952, not far from the new earthquake.\n\nThis earthquake was so powerful because it occurred at a depth of 12.8 miles, which is considered shallow, allowing it to release enormous amounts of energy into the waters above, and creating tsunami waves.\n\nForce 8 earthquakes release energy equivalent to 55 million tonnes of explosives.\n\nTsunami waves as high as 10-13 feet were reported in Kamchatka, while four feet waves hitHawaii, and a much smaller 12 inch surge hit a city in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Waves were expected to hit the California coast around 9am.\n\nDr Stephen Hicks, the NERC independent research fellow and lecturer in environmental seismology at UCL, said: “With such large earthquakes, long-period surface waves will continue travelling around the world for several days, with the planet continuing to resonate and ring like a large bell.”\n\nHowever it is unlikely to be as devastating as the 2011 Japanese disaster, in which 18,000 people were killed when an earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves of up to 133ft, and instigated a major nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power station.\n\nRoughly twenty thousand earthquakes occur every year, but only a small percentage of them are classified as high magnitude.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave key interest rates unchanged. And a Missouri furniture maker said his business is in jeopardy amid a yearslong legal battle with his insurance company.\n\nHere’s what to know today.\n\nOne of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations across the Pacific. In Hawaii, visitors and residents alike were forced to seek higher ground as powerful waves threatened the state.\n\nBut the alert level was downgraded to a tsunami advisory soon after the first waves hit after 7 p.m. local time, and evacuation orders were later canceled, allowing people to return to their homes. Tsunami waves up to a foot high reached the U.S. island territory of Guam, authorities said.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign uphereto get it in your inbox.\n\nThe waves were triggered by a 8.8-magnitude earthquake that struck off Russia’s remote Far East. Eyewitness videos showed damage to buildings, and a tsunami hit the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake is tied for the sixth-largest on record, along with a 2010 earthquake off Chile.\n\nTsunami waves in Japan arrived Wednesday afternoon local time on the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu, the country’s meteorological agency said. All workers were evacuated from the country’s Fukushima nuclear power plants, and the discharge of radioactive wastewater from the plant was suspended.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the first tsunami waves reached the California coast overnight at Crescent City and Humboldt Bay and were expected to build and become more dangerous during high tide.\n\nFollow our live blog for updates.\n\nDespite ongoing pressure from President Donald Trump, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to leave key interest rates unchanged, according to market projections and analysts. Powell is set to announce his decision today.\n\nMost data indicates the economy is in good shape, with a relatively low 4.1% unemployment rate and relatively subdued inflation. But in June, the economy began to show prices for apparel, appliances and toys beginning to accelerate, and forecasters suggested tariffs would be likely to continue to drive up consumer prices. In a twist, Powell said the Fed might have already cut interest rates had it not been for Trump’s volatile tariff policy.\n\nLast week, Trump made a rare visit to the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters. That visit, as well as his administration’s calls for lower interest rates, has raised concerns about the central bank’s long-standing independence and immunity to political interference. Meanwhile, two Trump-appointed members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the rate, have openly called for lowering rates. But Powell, who was also appointed during Trump’s first presidential term, has shown no signs he would budge.Read the full story here.\n\nMounting anger over the ongoing war in Gaza has prompted criticism toward Israel, with the U.K.saying it would recognize Palestine as a stateunless the Israeli government agrees to an “immediate ceasefire” and President Donald Trump calling for more aid to be sent to the enclave.\n\nTrump’s move, in particular, puts him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some fellow Republicans in Congress. But one of Trump’s top allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, has called the situation in Gaza a \"genocide\" even though she has advocated for an \"America First\" agenda.\n\nGreene represents a small but growing faction of Republicans who are expressing outrage at the starvation in Gaza, though many still disagree. \"If they would let the hostages go, they’d get a lot more food,\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said \"no,\" he does not believe there is a genocide in Gaza and that Congress shouldn’t provide more relief. Democrats, however, are mostly unified on the issue.Read the full story here.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegsethhas privately discussedthe idea of running for political office next year in Tennessee, sources said, potentially leading to a major shake-up at the Defense Department.\n\nThe GOP-led Senateconfirmed Emil Bove, Trump’s former personal lawyer and a DOJ employee, to a lifetime appeals court perch.\n\nThe House Oversight Committeedeclined a requestfrom Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers to grant her immunity in exchange for testifying to Congress.\n\nTrumpsaid Jeffrey Epstein \"stole\" Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent survivors of Epstein’s abuse scandal, from his Mar-a-Lago club.

Officials familiar with the investigation said the gunman left a note insinuating his mental illnessmay be linked to CTE, and he may have been targeting the NFL’s headquarters, which is in the building where he opened fire.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York City chief medical examiner’s office released the names of the four people killed in the violence: Wesley LePatner, 43, an executive with the management company Blackstone;Didarul Islam, 36, a NYPD officer; Aland Etienne, 46, a security guard at the building; and Julia Hyman, an employee of the real estate firm Rudin Management.

The show had just launched its new series, \"The Cost of Denial,\" which shines a light on the ways insurance companies often fail the very people they’re supposed to protect. He quickly jotted down the email address on screen and wrote to the team explaining his four-and-a-half-year-long insurance battle that he said has put his small business, Goebel Furniture, at risk of going under. He told me he never expected to hear from NBC.\n\nNBC News senior business correspondent Christine Romans and I traveled to St. Louis with a crew to hear Goebel’s story firsthand. His small business was built on the promise of \"Made in America\" — the type of business that was expected to thrive under Trump-era tariffs — but he said it has instead been brought to its knees by its insurance provider after storms damaged his building. Since the piece aired, Goebel’s story has captured the attention of both St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Spencer spoke highly of Goebel’s work, reputation in the community and commitment to American manufacturing.\n\nIndustry experts told us Goebel’s case is emblematic of a much larger problem: insurance companies making it nearly impossible for policyholders to collect after disaster strikes.

    "News_title":"Hawaii residents and visitors evacuate ahead of a tsunami that brought some flooding",
    "News_text":"Over a million Hawaii residents and visitors spent more than seven hours under threat of a potentially highly destructive tsunami Tuesday that triggered evacuations from low-lying coastal areas statewide.\n\nThe all-clear had not been declared by 10 p.m. but was expected following a tsunami warning issued by the National Weather Service around 2 :45 p.m. in response to an 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia.\n\nThe temblor struck at 1 :25 p.m. Hawaii time, 82.8 miles southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Kamchatka, Russia, at a depth of 46 miles, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThe warning resulted in Hawaii National Guard troops being activated, emergency alert sirens wailing several times, closing of the Hilo airport, flights canceled in and out of Maui, a U.S. Coast Guard order for all vessels to leave harbors and thousands of people in inundation zones relocating to higher ground and emergency shelters around the state. Emergency roads including Kolekole Pass on Oahu were opened to accommodate traffic, which did back up in several areas.\n\nGov. Josh Green urged the public to remain calm and safe as he provided several updates to the news media throughout the evening.\n\n“You must stay off the beaches and away from harbors, rivers and low-lying areas, ” Green said. “If you stay on beaches you could risk death.”\n\nWaves from the expected tsunami were expected on all shores statewide, with a projected first arrival time on Kauai by about 7 :10 p.m. followed by Oahu several minutes after that.\n\nGreen said at about 6 :20 p.m. that wave measurements taken off Midway Atoll showed a 3-foot surge, and warned that waves anticipated for Hawaii could be the same size and resembling a wall of water with force able to move cars, trees, power poles and other large objects.\n\nHowever, at about 8 :30 p.m. there was no known damage to report.\n\nBy 9 :25 p.m. the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported waves of 5.7 feet at Kahului, 4.9 feet at Hilo, 3.9 feet at Hanalei, 2.3 feet at Makapuu, 1.2 feet at Waianae and 1.1 feet in Honolulu. Other Hawaii areas listed were about 1 foot or less.\n\nCharles “Chip ” McCreery, director of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, said the first tsunami wave that hit Hanalei about 7 :10 p.m. measured about 1.5 feet above normal sea level.\n\nThe biggest known effect more than an hour later, Green reported, was seawater at Haleiwa Harbor on Oahu receding enough to leave some boats grounded, and the largest ocean buoy reading off Haleiwa measuring a more than 10-foot swell.\n\nStill, Green and emergency management officials said another two or three hours would need to pass and show diminishing tsunami wave cycle readings before the warning would be lifted.\n\n“There have been significant changes in the ocean levels, especially on the North Shore of Oahu, ” Honolulu City and County officials said in a news release around the same time. “Pacific Tsunami Warning Center experts remind everyone that the threat is not over and tsunami impacts could still occur over the next couple hours. … All residents in the City and County of Honolulu are urged to remain in higher elevations out of the tsunami inundation zone.”\n\nThe evacuation orders largely resulted in a safe retreat guided by emergency responders and government leaders, though there were traffic difficulties.\n\nMayor Rick Blangiardi, working from the city’s Emergency Operations Center, said, “This is a moment in time when people need to prioritize the safety of their families. We need everyone to take this situation seriously, act accordingly, evacuate inundation zones, and listen to first responders. We are asking everyone to remain calm and be safe.”\n\nCity transportation crews began a contraflow operation at 6 :30 p.m. to expedite evacuations, reversing lanes to push traffic inland. “If you know somebody who’s stuck in traffic, place that call, ” Blangiardi said, adding that police and traffic officials were stationed across the island to help direct drivers.\n\nActing Honolulu Police Chief Rade K. Vanic urged people to cooperate with officers and avoid unnecessary travel. “If you’ve arrived at a safe location—stay there, ” Vanic said. “And if you don’t need to call 911, don’t. We need our officers to be able to respond to actual emergencies.”\n\nRoger Morton, Director of the Department of Transportation Services, warned drivers on coastal roads such as Kamehameha Highway and Farrington Highway to assess their location immediately. “If you have any doubts, you need to get upslope immediately, ” he said. “Now’s the time to get to high ground.”\n\nTransportation officials also announced a major suspension of public transit operations that started at 6 p.m.\n\n“We are planning to stop operating any trip that was scheduled to start after 6 p.m., ” Morton said. “Up until 6 p.m., we’re going to continue to operate trips.”\n\nMorton noted that some buses might still be in inundation zones after 6 p.m. and could be detoured to higher ground to protect riders.\n\nEmergency Medical Services Director Jim Ireland said EMS crews had been working nonstop, dealing with an “excess amount ” of traffic accidents Tuesday. “We may not be able to respond into inundation zones until we get the all-clear, ” Ireland said. “Get to higher ground. Take your time. Drive safely.”\n\nIreland added that outreach workers had been deployed to coastal homeless encampments to notify people of the threat, but not all areas could be reached.\n\nThe mayor said Honolulu police were working to ease congestion, but acknowledged major traffic snarls across the island.\n\n“I know we’ve gotten some calls, ” Blangiardi said. “It is horrible, and people [are ] in gridlock. All I could ask is for people to keep their calm and we’ll try to move things along as best we can.”\n\nEmergency management officials were expected to provide further updates at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. after press time for this story.",
