    "News_text":"Following a series of aircraft malfunctions,managementmissteps, and astrikeby more than 33,000 machinists in 2024, theBoeingCompany’s C-suite continues to evolve.\n\nBrian West, Boeing’s CFO for the past four years, is stepping down and will become a senior advisor to president and CEO Kelly Ortberg, theFortune 500 companyannounced on Monday. Jesus “Jay” Malave has been appointed EVP and chief financial officer, effective Aug. 15.\n\nMalave will lead Boeing’s finance organization, as well as strategy, business planning, and global real estate, and will serve on the company’s executive council. He was most recently CFO ofLockheed Martinand previously held senior finance roles atL3Harris Technologies. Malave spent more than 20 years at United Technologies (UTC), including serving as CFO of Carrier Corporation when it was a UTC division.\n\nWest, Malave’s predecessor, was appointed by former CEO Dave Calhoun in 2021. Both Calhoun and West areGeneral Electricalumni. Calhoun, who pledged in March 2024 to retire by year-end following the widely publicizeddoor-plug blowoutover Portland, Or., on Jan. 5, 2024, was succeeded by Ortberg, who began his tenure on Aug. 8, 2024.\n\nIn selecting a new CEO, Boeing’s board was determined to appoint an outsider like Ortberg who could reform its culture and refocus on quality and reliability in manufacturing,Fortunereported. The board also sought a leader with a long-term vision, including plans for a long-overdue next-generation aircraft to strengthen Boeing’s position againstAirbusin the narrow-body market.\n\nBoth Ortberg and Malave worked at UTC during their careers and are now strategic partners. “Jay will become CFO at an important time in helping build Boeing’s next chapter,” Ortberg said in astatement. The company continues to make progress on its recovery and implementing fundamental changes rooted in safety and quality, he added.\n\nAny chief executive or finance chief would say that “a strong CEO-CFO relationship is critical” to successful execution—whether the strategy is turnaround, growth, or something in between, Scott Simmons, co-managing partner at executive search firm Crist Kolder Associates, toldFortune. “There must be trust and respect between those two positions to make it all work.”\n\nMalave brings decades of experience developing people and teams across complex aerospace and manufacturing businesses, according to Ortberg.\n\nRegarding Boeing’s challenges, “I’m certain the board empowered Ortberg to ‘fix it’ and provided him with a very long leash,” Simmons said. The most important element Malave brings, beyond his track record at large, complex aerospace companies, is the ability to establish instant trust with Ortberg, he said: “This will allow them to hit the ground running.”\n\nFitch Ratingsannouncedon Monday that it has revised its outlook for Boeing from “negative” to “stable.” The change reflects improved post-strike production, greater financial flexibility—including the Aprilagreementto sell its Jeppesen navigation and digital aviation business and related assets to Thoma Bravo for $10.55 billion in cash—and reduced downgrade risks, supporting the company’s BBB- rating. The stable outlook also factors in Fitch’s expectation of gross debt reduction, including repayment of all 2026 notes at maturity ($7.95 billion).\n\nMalave and Ortberg will need to continue working to maintain positive momentum.\n\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com",

Early reports show that the cause was a disruption of technological processes. The fire was quickly contained... Three employees were killed.

    "News_text":"US stocks were mixed on Tuesday as President Trump's massive budget bill passed in the Senate and Wall Street watchedfor progress on trade talks.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed down 0.1%, pulling back from a record close after finishingabove 6,200for the first time on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell around 0.7%, with Tesla (TSLA)stock sliding5% as CEO ElonMusk's feud with Trump flared upagain.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 1%, largely led by a pop in healthcare stocks including United Healthcare (UNH), which rose 4.5%.\n\nSenate lawmakers voted 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, to pass Trump's signature tax and spending bill, racing to meet the president's desired July 4 deadline. The bill now goes back to the House, which will vote on the Senate's changes.\n\nRepublicans wrangled over the bill's measures overnight, including one amendment that passed with strong bipartisan support: A strike-down of the ban on state-level AI regulation. They also ended up slightly softening a phase out of clean-energy tax credits.\n\nAnother looming deadline has prompted the US to scale back Trump's push for full-blown \"reciprocal\" deals with trading partners, theFinancial Times reported. Instead, officials are racing to find narrower agreements beforeJuly 9, when the president's sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs are set to resume.\n\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\n\nMeanwhile, investors closely watched commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and labor market data as debate intensifies over when the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates.\n\nJerome Powell spoke about the Fed's policy stance at an ECB forum in Portgual on Tuesday,fresh from another Trump attackpushing the Federal Reserve chair to slash interest rates to 1% — a huge 250-point reduction.Powell remarkedthat tariffs are causing the central bank to take its time before cutting interest rates, but he said the US economy remains healthy overall.\n\nFresh data Tuesday showedjob openings rose more than expectedin May. The hiring and quits rates remain near decade lows, reflecting what economists have described asa labor market in \"stasis.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the lone major index in the green on Tuesday led by several healthcare stocks catching bids. UnitedHealthcare (UNH) stock, which had been the worst performer in the Dow this year and down more than 35% to start 2025, rose about 4.5% on Tuesday.\n\nTuesday's market action proved to be positive for a slew of laggards through the first half of this year. The small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT), which had underperformed all three major averages through the first six months of this year, rose more than 1% on Tuesday.\n\nBelow is a look at how every Dow component performed on Tuesday.\n\nStocks stageda historic comebackfrom their April lows, finishing the first half of the year on a high note with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) securing back-to-back all-time records.\n\nA large part of the market's gains has hinged oneasing geopolitical tensionsand tariff-related deescalations,including the emergence of the so-called TACO trade,an acronym for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"\n\nThe phrase captures a belief among some investors that the president often talks tough on tariffs but rarely follows through. That assumption has helped fuel a tailwind for markets in recent months as traders increasingly bet on last-minute policy pivots.\n\nTrade deal frameworks with China and the UKare reportedly now on the table ahead of Trump's self-imposed July 9 deadline. This has led investors to price in a\"Goldilocks scenario\"for stocks, with sustained earnings growth, little effects from tariffs, and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBut Wall Street prosare signaling cautionas they assess the path forward, which still includes many unknowns.\n\n\"Just as Goldilocks awoke from her sleep to confront three bears, there are several areas where this optimism is likely to be challenged,\" JPMorgan's economics and policy team, led by Bruce Kasman, wrote in a recent client note.\n\nKasman cautioned investors not to \"get carried away by inflation momentum,\" warning that tariffs are still set to risedespite ongoing trade negotiations. This will add pressure to a US economy already grappling withsofter consumer demandand signs of stalling global factory activity.\n\n\"The economy is entering the second half of the year on wobbly footing,\" Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams added.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThe latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) released on Tuesday showed 7.76 million jobs were open at the end of the May, the highest level since November 2024.\n\nAfterseveral signs of slowing in the labor markethave emerged over the past months in areas like continuing unemployment claims and slowing hiring, Tuesday's data reminds us that there's a bit of something for everyone in the current economic data being analyzed asinvestors debate when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next.\n\nTuesday's data suggested the labor market remained \"healthy\" in May, Capital Economics North America economist Alexandra Brown wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nOxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note that there was \"nothing\" in the May JOLTS report to shake the Fed's patient approach.\n\nBut Vanden Houten noted that when the Fed does cut the \"risk is growing\" that the Fed's next interest rate cut is a 50 basis point move rather than 25 basis points.\n\nSolar stocks rallied in afternoon trade after the Senate voted to remove an excise tax on wind and solar projects from President Trump’s $3.3 trillion tax bill.\n\nShares of Sunrun (RUN) surged roughly 10% in afternoon trading. Enphase Energy (ENPH), one of the worst-performing stocks this year, climbed about 4%, while SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) gained approximately 7% shortly after the news broke.\n\nSenate leaders pushed the bill closer to passage in a highly anticipated vote on Tuesday.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, the measure passed with a 50-50 split in the Senate, with three Republican defections. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the bill, which marked a significant win for the solar and wind energy sectors.\n\nHere's why: The bill originally included a new tax on wind and solar projects using a certain amount of parts made in China. Some US manufacturers supported this to reduce dependence on China. But renewable energy developers warned it would raise costs for their projects because many still rely on Chinese parts.\n\nTo note, the bill still plans to gradually end subsidies for new wind and solar projects starting after 2027, despite some Republican efforts to delay that cutoff.\n\nCircle (CRCL) has formally applied with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to get a national trust bank charter, the company said Tuesday.\n\nShares of the stablecoin issuer gained 2.8% in afternoon trading after opening in the red. The stock is up 500% since itsJune 5 IPO.\n\nYahoo Finance'sDavid Hollerithreports:\n\nRead more here.\n\nSenate Republicans were able to push President Trump's signature tax legislation over the line to pass it by a thin margin.\n\nYahoo Finance'sBen Werschkulbreaks down the Senate's changes to thecomplex, nearly 900-page billthat are set to reshape the US economy. Here are three major impacts to businesses and the economy:\n\nChanges for both the individual and corporate tax structure:\n\nA focus on energy:\n\nFinal-hour healthcare changes:\n\nRead more here about the bill's impacts on taxes and more.\n\nUS stocks remained a mixed bag on Tuesday after Senate lawmakers voted to advance President Trump's tax and spending bill.\n\nVice President JD Vance broke the 50-50 tie to pass the bill after Republican lawmakers pulled an all-nighter to make several last-minute changes and break through Democratic opposition and the Senate's thin margins. The \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the House for a vote on the Senate's changes.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) briefly pared some losses but didn't break into positive territory following the news. The benchmark index was down 0.1% in midafternoon trading.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led losses, falling around 0.8%, as Tesla (TSLA)stock fellmore than 4% after a feud between Elon Musk andTrump flared upagain.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), on the other hand, rose over 1% in afternoon trading.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's (ISM)manufacturing PMIregistered a reading of 49 in June, up slightly from May's reading of 48.5 Readings above 50 for this index indicate an expansion in activity, while readings below 50 indicate contraction. The manufacturing sector has been in contraction for most of the past two years.\n\nThe price paid index, which is seen as a potential indicator of future prices increases that will passed on by businesses, increased to 69.7 up from 69.4 the month prior. Meanwhile, the employment index registered a reading of 45%, down from 46.8% in May.\n\n\"Despite the modest gain in the ISM manufacturing index in June, the details of the report point to continued struggles for domestic manufacturers,\" Oxford Economics senior economist Matthew Martin wrote in a note to clients. \"Demand uncertainty and bartering over who foots the tariff bill are leading to delays or cancellations in orders. Until tariff policies and geopolitical issues fade, this is unlikely to change.\"\n\nShares of struggling chipmaker Wolfspeed (WOLF) climbed 11% Tuesday, though the stock was priced at less than $1 as the companyfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nThe North Carolina-based semiconductor firm wasbuilding a $5 billion plantthatwould employ 1,800 workersin the state with funding from the CHIPS Act. Delays in receiving its funding from the Trump administration haveamplified the company's financial challenges.\n\nWolfspeed said in astatementMonday that it's looking to slash $4.6 billion from its debt pile through a creditor-backed restructuring plan.\n\n\"By taking this proactive step, the Company expects to be better positioned to execute on its long-term growth strategy and accelerate its path to profitability,\" the company said.\n\nCEO Robert Feurle added, “Looking ahead, we remain laser-focused on delivering cutting-edge products to our customers and working with our vendors in the normal course.\"\n\nApple (AAPL) stock jumped 2% Tuesday following areportfrom Bloomberg that the iPhone maker is considering using AI technology from startups Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) or OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) to power a new version of Siri.\n\nApple has spoken to both companies about using their large language models for its voice assistant, Bloomberg wrote, citing unnamed sources.\n\nApple has struggled to catch up to its peers on AI, and its efforts to launch a new AI-powered Siri have fallen flat. Shares of the company have lagged behind its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, save for Tesla (TSLA), and are down 16% in 2025.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) shares jumped as analysts issued bullish notes on the stock following itslaunch of new crypto servicesat an event Monday.\n\n“HOOD’s incredible product velocity makes it hard to keep up with innovation,” Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a note to clients Tuesday, upgrading his price target on the stock to $99 from $80. Shares traded around $96 on Tuesday morning.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Alex Markgraff also raised his price target on the stock to $110 from $60 following the event, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nRobinhood stock is up nearly 158% in 2025 as crypto-related stocks have rallied on the heels of President Trump’s election. Trump has favored deregulation of the fraud-ridden crypto industry, unlike his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) has risen 40% this year, while bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) is up 34%. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) itself is up 13% in 2025.\n\nJob openings rose more than expected in May while investors closely watch for any signs of slowing in the labor market as debate over when the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates again intensifies.\n\nNew data from the Bureau of Labor Statisticsshowed 7.76 million jobs open at the end of May, an increase from the 7.39 million seen the month prior and the highest level since November 2024. The April figure was revised higher by 4,000 from the 7.39 million open jobs initially reported. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Tuesday's report to show 7.3 million openings in May.\n\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) also showed that 5.5 million hires were made during the month, down from the 5.61 million made during April. The hiring rate ticked lower to 3.4% from 3.5%. In one sign that workers remain cautious about labor market conditions, the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, moved up to 2.1% from 2% in April.\n\nStill, both the hiring and quits rates are hovering near decade lows, reflecting what economists have described asa labor market in \"stasis.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has begun speaking about the Fed's policy stance at an ECB forum in Sintra, Portugal, where he said that tariffs are causing the central bank to take its time before cutting interest rates.\n\nWhen asked if the Fed would have cut interest rates by more by now if it weren't for higher tariffs, Powell stated, \"I think that’s right.\"\n\n\"In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,\" Powell continued. \"Essentially, all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs.\"\n\nPowell noted that the US economy remains healthy overall but that he expects to see the effects of tariffs filter through the economic data in the coming months. In recent days, Powell has faced increased pressure, including in the form of handwritten notes, from President Trump to lower interest rates.\n\n\"Ignore the tariffs for a second,\" Powell said of the economy. \"Inflation is behaving pretty much exactly as we have expected and hoped that it would. We haven't seen effects much yet from tariffs, and we didn't expect to by now.\"\n\nWatch Powell speak live below:\n\nUS stocks pulled back from record highs Tuesday morning as President Trump's massive budget bill made its way through the Senate and investors lookedfor progress on trade talksahead of the July 9 deadline.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 0.3% afterclosing above 6,200for the first time on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded roughly flat.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.4%, with Tesla (TSLA)stock plummeting more than 7%as CEO ElonMusk's feud with Trump reignited.Nvidia (NVDA) fell 1% and Meta (META) dropped fractionally after the two members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" hit fresh records the prior day.\n\nTesla (TSLA) stock sank as much as 6% before the market open Tuesday as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Trumpreignitedovernight, with the president once again threatening to cut government subsidies across Elon Musk’s businesses, including Tesla and SpaceX (SPAX.PVT).\n\n“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trumpwroteon his social media platform Truth Social early Monday.\n\n“No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.

    "News_text":"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli airstrikes and shootings killed 94Palestinians in Gazalate Wednesday and Thursday, including 45 who were attempting to get much-needed humanitarian aid, hospitals and the Health Ministry said Thursday.\n\nFamilies wept over the bodies from a strike that hit a tent camp during the night as displaced people slept in southern Gaza. At least 13 members of a single family were killed, including at least six children under 12.\n\n“My children, my children … my beloved,” wailed Intisar Abu Assi, sobbing over the bodies of her son and daughters and their young children. Another woman kissed the forehead of a dead little girl wrapped in a blanket on the floor of the morgue at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis.\n\nIn central Gaza, a boy stroked the face of his dead sister, 6-year-old Heba Abu Etiwi, in a morgue at Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital. The girl and another of her brothers were among eight people killed when a strike Wednesday evening hit near a stand selling falafel.\n\nA separate strike on a school in Gaza City sheltering displaced people also killed 15 people.\n\nThe toll from strikes emerged as more Palestinians were killed in near-daily shootings while trying to obtain aid.\n\nFive were killed on the roads leading to food-distribution sites run by theGaza Humanitarian Foundation,the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strip’s population. Another 40 were killed while waiting for trucks carrying U.N. aid in several locations around Gaza, according to hospital officials.\n\nWitnesses have said Israeli troops regularly unleash barrages on crowds of Palestinians trying to reach the GHF sites. Witnesses have also reported troops opening fire when crowds of people mass near military-run zones of Gaza, waiting for U.N. trucks to enter.\n\nMore than500 Palestinianshave been killed and hundreds more wounded since the food-distribution sites opened in May.\n\nThe Israeli military, whose forces are deployed on the roads leading to the sites, says it fires warning shots to control crowds or at Palestinians who approach its troops. Armed U.S. contractors guard the sites.\n\nAmnesty says Israel using starvation as a weapon\n\nAmnesty International on Thursdayissued a reportsaying Israel was continuing to “use starvation of civilians as a weapon of war … as part of its ongoing genocide.”\n\nIt said the GHF distribution system appeared intended only to “placate international concerns” even as Israel allows in only a small amount of food for the U.N. to distribute separately.\n\n“By maintaining a deadly, dehumanizing and ineffective militarized ‘aid’ scheme, Israeli authorities have turned aid-seeking into a booby trap for desperate starved Palestinians,” it said.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry denounced the Amnesty report, saying the organization has “joined forces with Hamas and fully adopted all of its propaganda lies.”\n\nIsrael has rejected allegations it is committing genocide in Gaza in the war with Hamas, and it is challenging the accusation filed by South Africa at theInternational Court of Justice.\n\nAmnestyaccused Israel last year ofcommitting genocide, saying it has sought to deliberately destroy Palestinians by mounting deadly attacks, demolishing vital infrastructure and preventing the delivery of food, medicine and other aid.\n\nIsrael intends for GHF to replace the U.N. humanitarian network, which has delivered massive amounts of aid to Palestinians throughout the war. Israel contends that Hamas siphons off large amounts of aid from that system, a claim that the U.N. and aid groups deny. They have rejected GHF, saying it cannot deliver enough aid, endangers Palestinians and is being used by Israel to carry out its war goals.\n\nIsrael cut off all food and other supplies to Gaza for more 2 ½ months this year, driving its populationtoward famine, in what it said was a move to push Hamas to make concessions in negotiations and release hostages.\n\nIt eased the blockade in March. The Foreign Ministry and COGAT, the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, said Wednesday that Israel has facilitated the entry of over 3,000 aid trucks into the Gaza Strip since May 19.\n\nThat amounts to around 28 trucks a day, a fraction of the hundreds of trucks a day aid workers say are needed.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, GHF rejected criticism of its operations and said it has delivered the equivalent of more than 52 million meals. GHF distributes boxes of food staples such as lentils and rice, saying one box holds the equivalent of more than 50 meals.\n\nWitnesses have reported scenes of chaos at GHF sites as desperate crowds race to pick up food boxes, with some taking more than one while many others go empty-handed. Much of the food is sold in markets at astronomical prices.\n\nWork continues on elusive ceasefire\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza has passed 57,000 since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its death count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.\n\nThe deaths come as Israel and Hamas inch closer to a possible ceasefire that would end the 21-month war.\n\nTrump said Tuesdaythat Israel had agreed on terms for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen. Hamas’ response emphasized its demand that the truce lead to an end to the war.\n\nThe Israeli military blames Hamas for the civilian casualties because it operates from populated areas. The military said it targeted Hamas militants and rocket launchers in northern Gaza that fired toward Israel on Wednesday.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages.\n\nThe war has left the coastal Palestinian territory in ruins, with much of the urban landscape flattened in the fighting. More than 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced, often multiple times.\n\n___\n\nChehayeb reported from Beirut.",

    "News_title":"Israel kills more than 300 in Gaza in 48 hours as focus intensifies on GHF",
    "News_text":"More than 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the last 48 hours, according to the Gaza Government Media Office, which says Israel has “committed 26 bloody massacres” in that period.\n\nAt least 118 Palestinians were killed and 581 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s Health Ministry said on Thursday. At least 73 of those were killed since dawn, including 33 aid seekers at the controversial Israeli and United States-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF) aid sites.\n\nThirteen people were killed when Israeli forces attacked a tent in al-Mawasi in the south, while 16 were killed and many wounded in an attack on Mustafa Hafez School, sheltering displaced people west of Gaza City, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmed Mansour, a displaced Palestinian taking shelter in the school building, said, “We woke up to fierce [Israeli] air strikes. It felt like an earthquake. People say it was a drone attack, but the sound was horrifying, relentless shelling. Missiles were so destructive that they set everything on fire. Victims were left burning for hours without help. There is no one here to save us.”\n\nThe Government Media Office statement on Thursday said the attacks over the last 48 hours had targeted civilians in shelters and displacement centres overcrowded with tens of thousands of displaced people, public rest areas, Palestinian families inside their homes, popular markets and vital civilian facilities, and starving civilians searching for food.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah on the latest killings of Palestinians near GHF aid centres, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said, “People described scenes of horror as they wait for hours just hoping to get their hands on basic food supplies, only to be met with sudden and unprovoked gunfire … I’ve been speaking to a number of survivors this morning, and they told me such heartbreaking testimonies and they shared the horrific scenes that unfolded near the GHF-run aid centres.\n\n“They told me that there was no prior warning, no prior indication – just gunfire ripping through the crowd, desperate Palestinians scattered for cover as bullets flew. They told me that emergency services and medical teams were not able to access the area due to the intensity of the gunfire … This absolutely reflects the collapse of the humanitarian landscape here in Gaza,” he added.\n\nUS contractors ostensibly guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza have been using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press news agency.\n\nTwo US contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity, said they were speaking out because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open licence to do whatever they wished.\n\nLater Thursday, GHF released a statement of denial.  “GHF launched an immediate investigation when the Associated Press first brought these allegations to our attention. Based on time-stamped video footage and sworn witness statements, we have concluded that the claims in the AP’s story are categorically false.”\n\n“At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the [Israeli military], who was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF distribution site. It was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured,” it claimed without providing evidence.\n\nA recent report from Israeli outletHaaretzdetailed Israeli troops, in their words, confirming that Israeli soldiers have deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, said the GHF is “not just to replace the humanitarian mechanism run by international organisations for decades in Gaza, but it’s also to apply maximum pressure on the civilian population”. Odeh also noted that Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said this week that too much aid is going to Gaza and that none should enter to ensure an Israeli victory.\n\nDr Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian emergency medicine doctor and professor who has provided healthcare in Gaza for more than 30 years, told Al Jazeera that the GHF operation “is part of the [Israeli military forces]’ and the Israeli government plan to ethnically cleanse and to fulfil their goal of genocide in Gaza”.\n\n“This has nothing to do with alleviating starvation in Gaza,” Gilbert said.\n\nDescribing the aid from GHF as a “drop in the ocean” and a “sham operation”, Gilbert added, “The distribution organisation is aimed at using food as bait to attract starving people, to terrorise them and to kill them. The shooting of people in food lines is a war crime.”\n\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called for investigations into the killings and wounding of Palestinians trying to access food through GHF. UNRWA notes that while it operated about 400 sites across the besieged enclave, GFH has set up only four “mega-sites”, three in the south and one in central Gaza – none in the north, where conditions are most severe. In a post on X, UNRWA called for the UN to “do the work” in distributing aid.\n\nMore than 130 humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Amnesty International, on Tuesday demanded the immediate closure of the GHF, accusing it of facilitating attacks on starving Palestinians.\n\nThe NGOs said Israeli forces and armed groups “routinely” open fire on civilians attempting to access food.\n\nSince the GHF began operations in late May, more than650 Palestinians have been killedwhile seeking aid, and nearly 4,000 have been wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas has said it is studying a new proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, but insisted it is seeking an agreement that would bring an end to Israel’s devastating war.\n\nHamas said in a statement on Wednesday that it had received proposals from the mediators and is holding talks with them to “bridge gaps” to return to the negotiating table and try to reach a ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe Palestinian group said it was aiming for an agreement that would end the Gaza war and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.\n\nThe announcement came a day after US President Donald Trump said Israel had agreed to the ceasefire proposal and urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen. Trump has been increasing pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas to broker a ceasefire and an agreement for the group to release the Israeli captives held in Gaza.",

    "News_title":"Wisconsin Supreme Court abortion ban decision draws mixed reviews",
    "News_text":"GREEN BAY, Wis. (WFRV) – On Wednesday, Wisconsin Supreme Court justices struck down the state’s 1849 abortion ban drawing mixed reviews from Wisconsinites.\n\nThat law had banned abortionsin almost all instances except when the life of the mother was at risk. The law lay dormant for decades after the introduction of Roe v. Wade. in 1973. It reactivated in June 2022 when U.S. Supreme Court justices issued theDobbs decision ending the federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nSince Roe v. Wade fell, Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a Wisconsin obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN), has emerged as one of the faces for Wisconsin’s pro-choice movement. On Wednesday afternoon, she spoke with Local 5 News about her reaction to the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision on this issue.\n\n“It feels like a step in the right direction, but I’m not in this because I’m trying to win battles,” she said. “I’m in this because my patients need healthcare.”\n\nWisconsin Senate passes state budget in rush to help hospitals\n\nPrevious challenges to the ban allowed ‘Planned Parenthood’ clinics to reopen, but many hospital systems and physicians decided to avoid offering abortion care at the time because there was still confusion about what was and wasn’t allowed under the law. Lyerly said the Supreme Court justices’ decision changes all of that.\n\n“Now that the Supreme Court has weighed in many of these hospital systems, these physicians that have been waiting, the message is very clear they can move forward they can offer their patients the care they need and deserve,” said Lyerly.\n\nWith the Supreme Court clearing the way for physicians to provide abortion care to patients, Lyerly said her focus is going to be helping patients in rural Wisconsin communities. She said it was these areas the abortion ban harmed the most.\n\n$29 million sewer renewal project begins in Green Bay and Allouez, brings long-term disruptions\n\n“I took an oath to take care of my patients, we sit in an exam room and we come up with a solution for them,” Lyerly said. “(Finding) a solution that works in their lives that is the greatest joy of being a doctor. When I can’t do that I have to fight for them.”\n\nWhile Lyerly and other pro-choice advocates celebrate the Wisconsin Supreme Court justices’ latest ruling, others condemned it. This includes state senator Andre Jacque.\n\n“Blatant example of judicial activism just simply disregarding those laws that you disagree with personally and that’s extremely dangerous to our state,” he told Local 5 News.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court justices are supposed to be non-partisan, but it’s no secret that some justices lean left and others lean to the right. Liberal-leaning justices hold a 4-3 majority on the state’s high court right now which to many made it feel inevitable that they would eventually overturn the 1849 abortion ban.\n\nJudge Janet Protasiewicz received heavy criticism from Republicans when she constantly talked about her views on abortion rights on the campaign trail back in 2023.\n\n“Given the liberal majority they were going to go through every contortion that was necessary to strike down something that they didn’t agree with,” Jacque said.\n\nThroughout his legislative career, Jacque has strongly opposed abortion rights and has consistently pushed back on attempts for taxpayers dollars to be used for abortion services. For this reason as well, he said the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision disappointed him.\n\n“I believe that both science, reason, and morality point to (preserving) life at every stage of development,” he said. “I think it’s very hard to arbitrarily draw a line where life begins. I want to protect the vulnerable across the board whether that is the unborn, individuals inflicted by domestic violence or sexual assault.”\n\nGreen Bay police, fire departments to face off in ‘Battle of the Badges’ blood drive\n\nA big part of the justices’ argument for throwing out the 1849 abortion ban is that there’s more recent laws that deal with the topic that supersede the 19th century law. These laws allow abortions up to when the child can live outside the womb which is around the 20th week of a pregnancy.\n\nA local prosecutor told Local 5 News that in practice it’s very rare for people to face charges for violating a 20 week abortion ban.\n\n“This is a really important judgement, and it means that women in Wisconsin can access fundamental, reproductive, healthcare,” Lyerly said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Figmapublicly sharedits financials Tuesday, inching the design software company closer to an IPO. And while this initial S-1 is missing details such as number of shares to be offered and what price, the regulatory filing provides the clearest view yet of its financial health — and potential.\n\nIPO experts Renaissance Capital estimate that Figmacould raise up to $1.5 billionin this offering. If it does meet or exceed that, Figma’s IPO will match or beat CoreWeave’s, which raised $1.5 billion and hasbeen the biggest tech IPO of 2025 so far.\n\nThere are some reasons to believe that Figma could pull it off. Its financials are impressive, per the S-1 filing.\n\nThe company brought in $749 million in revenue in 2024, a 48% jump from 2023. Figma’s revenue continued to rise in the first quarter of 2025 with 46% year-over-year growth. The company reported rolling 12-month revenue as $821 million, with a 91% gross margin.\n\nFigma’s profit is interesting, too. The company was profitable in 2023 and then swung to a giant loss of $732 million in 2023. But this was largely due to one-time expenses related to a major employee stock compensation event. (Figma issued 10.5 million stock options, with a strike price of $8.50 per share to eligible employees, it said.)\n\nBy the fourth quarter of 2024, Figma reported profits again, as it did in Q1 of 2025.\n\nFigma has also calculated its total debt to be so negligible that it reports it has none. But again, this is a line item that needs to be filled in. The company, naturally, has a revolving debt line, and left room to update its total debt in association with that.\n\nWe also don’t know yet if any of the executives or VCs will be selling shares. Major backers include Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia.\n\nWe do know that in 2024, executives took part of a big tender offer that allowed employees to cash out of shares. For instance, Figma co-founder CEO and chairman Dylan Field cashed out of $20 million worth of shares as part of that sale.\n\nThe S-1 document made another interesting disclosure, about co-founder Evan Wallace, who left Figma in 2021,according to his website. Wallace is named in the documents as a co-founder. However, Figma says Wallace has given Field full voting rights and control over his shares. Wallace’s family trust holds about one-third of the super-voting rights Class B shares (15 votes per share, Figma says). All told, the S-1 discloses that Field, pre-IPO, controls about 75% of the voting rights.\n\nThe financials certainly look like the kind of company that Wall Street and retail investors typically like to buy. The one black cloud, if you can call it that, is the rise of vibe coding\/designing AI apps.Upstarts like Lovableare targeting Figma’s market and growing fast. Figma, though, has its own set of AI products as well.\n\nFigma acknowledges in the S-1 the risks of failing to stand out in a competitive AI industry.\n\n“While we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to integrate AI, includinggenerative AI, into our platform, AI technologies are rapidly evolving and there can be no guarantee thatour products will remain competitive as new AI technologies are developed, adopted, and integrated intosoftware solutions,” the company says in the regulatory document.",

    "News_text":"Ryanair has cancelled 170 flights because of strikes by French air traffic control (ATC) staff, disrupting travel plans for tens of thousands of people.\n\nMichael O’Leary, chief executive of the Irish budget airline, accused the strikers of holding European families “to ransom” on Tuesday as the company announced that the flights would not take place.\n\nThe cancellations are estimated to affect around 30,000 passengers.\n\nAs well as flights to and from France, flights that pass through French airspace to locations such as Greece and Spain will be affected, Ryanair said.\n\nThe strikes coincide with the start of the European summer holidays, one of the busiest periods for travel every year.\n\nMr O’Leary said: “Once again European families are held to ransom by French air traffic controllers going on strike. It is not acceptable that overflights over French airspace en route to their destination are being cancelled\/delayed as a result ofyet another French ATC strike.\n\n“It makes no sense and is abundantly unfair on EU passengers and families going on holidays.”\n\nATC workers in France have gone on strike for higher pay and more staff. The decision to launch the industrial action was taken after talks with the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) fell apart.\n\nOn Wednesday, DGAC asked carriers to reduce flights at Paris airports by 40pc as a result of the turmoil. Further cuts have been called for at other locations such as Nice, Bastia, Calvi, Lyon, Marseille and Montpellier.\n\nMr O’Leary called on Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, to reform European ATC services by making sure they are fully staffed for the first wave of daily departures and protecting overflights during strikes.\n\nHe said: “These two splendid reforms would eliminate 90pc of all ATC delays and cancellations, and protect EU passengers from these repeated and avoidable ATC disruptions due to yet another French ATC strike.”\n\nIn an update to investors, Mr O’Leary described the strikers as “recreational” as he railed against their activities.\n\nThe businessman has criticised striking French workers many times in the past. In 2023 he urged customers to sign a petition calling on the European Commission to keep the skies open as France battled a similar wave of industrial action.\n\nSpeaking at the time, he said: “People are really f-----g p----d off with flights getting cancelled left, right and centre because the French are on strike.”\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has warned travellers that they may face disruption and delays this week and to seek advice if they plan to travel across France this week.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"By Nidal al-Mughrabi\n\nCAIRO\/GAZA (Reuters) -Hamas is seeking guarantees that a new U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza would lead to the war's end, a source close to the militant group said on Thursday, as medics said Israeli strikes across the territory had killed scores more people.\n\nIsraeli officials said prospects for reaching a ceasefire and hostage deal appeared high, nearly 21 months since the war between Israel and Hamas began.\n\nEfforts for a Gaza truce gathered steam after the U.S. secured a ceasefire to end a 12-day aerial conflict between Israel and Iran, but on the ground in Gaza intensified Israeli strikes continued unabated, killing at least 59 people on Thursday, according to health authorities in the territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S.President Donald Trumpsaid that Israel had accepted the conditions needed to finalise a 60-day ceasefire with Hamas, during which the parties will work to end the war.\n\nHamas is seeking clear guarantees that the ceasefire will eventually lead to the war's end, the source close to the group said. Two Israeli officials said those details were still being worked out.\n\nIn a statement early on Friday, Hamas said it was discussing the ceasefire proposal with other Palestinian factions and would submit its response to mediators once those talks conclude.\n\nEgyptian and Qatari mediators have been working to secure U.S. and international guarantees that talks on ending the war would continue as a way of convincing Hamas to accept a two-month truce proposal, Egyptian security sources said.\n\nA senior Israeli official close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said preparations were in place to approve a ceasefire deal. A separate source familiar with the matter said that Israel was expecting Hamas' response by Friday and that if it was positive, an Israeli delegation would join indirect talks to cement the deal.\n\nThe proposal includes the staggered release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the return of the bodies of 18 more in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, an official familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. Of the 50 remaining hostages in Gaza, 20 are believed to still be alive.\n\nAid would enter Gaza immediately, and the Israeli military would carry out a phased withdrawal from parts of the enclave, according to the proposal. Negotiations would immediately start on a permanent ceasefire.\n\n\"We sure hope it's a done deal, but I think it's all going to be what Hamas is willing to accept,\" U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told Israel's Channel 12 on Thursday. \"One thing is clear: The president wants it to be over. The prime minister wants it to be over. The American people, the Israeli people, want it to be over.\"\n\nHuckabee added that he would be taking part in talks next week at the White House, when Netanyahu is due to meet with Trump.\n\n'WHAT CAN WE DO?'\n\nIn Gaza, there was no sign of immediate relief on Thursday. According to medics at Nasser Hospital, at least 20 people were killed by Israeli fire en route to an aid distribution site.\n\nFurther north, at least 17 people were killed in an Israeli strike at a school in Gaza City, according to medics. The Israeli military said it targeted a key Hamas gunman operating there and that it took precautions to reduce risk to civilians.\n\n\"Suddenly, we found the tent collapsing over us and a fire burning. We don’t know what happened,\" one witness, Wafaa Al-Arqan, who was among the people sheltering there, told Reuters. \"What can we do? Is it fair that all these children burned?\"\n\nThe war began when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael's subsequent military assault has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, while displacing most of the population of more than 2 million, triggering widespread hunger and leaving much of the territory in ruins.\n\nIsrael says it won't end the war while Hamas is still armed and ruling Gaza. Hamas, severely weakened, says it won't lay down its weapons but is willing to release all the hostages still in Gaza if Israel ends the war.\n\n(Additional reporting by Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem and Ahmed Salaby in Cairo; Editing by Aidan Lewis, Alexandra Hudson, Rosalba O'Brien and Daniel Wallis)",

    "News_title":"Environmental agencies, advocates respond to Braun executive orders",
    "News_text":"Gov. Mike Braun sought to strike \"burdensome\" environmental regulations, but an initial review didn't identify many rules to target. (Getty Images)\n\nThe Indiana Department of Environmental Management identified a handful of regulations that could clash with a gubernatorial order to eliminate “unduly burdensome” or costly rules, though nearly all of them appear to be relatively minor tweaks.\n\nStill, Sam Carpenter, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, said Gov. Mike Braun’s mandate to review the agency seems like a decision that “environmental protections are bad for businesses before really, fully understanding and researching the issues.\n\n“… we just need to keep in mind that protections are in place because, often, an event has occurred and we realized that the protections that were currently in place were not sufficient,” he continued.\n\nIndiana Senate approves sweeping administrative rulemaking overhaul\n\nFor example, Carpenter pointed to IDEM’s new recommendation to streamline the process for alternative thermal effluent limits. Carpenter said that those processes were established in response to a 1999 chemical spill that killed more than 4 million fish — something not acknowledged in the review.\n\nJust 14 facilities fall into this regulatory category, according to the state agency, but the process for meeting those water quality standards and getting approval “can be burdensome and create(s) uncertainty.”\n\nThe report recommended the agency revisit the guidelines.\n\nThe17-page regulatory review, submitted by IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods and General Counsel William Anthony on July 1, stems fromdual March 12 executive ordersfrom Braun that targeted environmental justice and overregulation. While one focused on burdens and cost, the other sought to align the state’s rules with federal regulations. The latter report is due later this year.\n\n“IDEM is committed to ensuring that its regulatory actions are consistent with statutory authority, supported by the best available science, and not unduly burdensome,” read a July 1 letter in response to the governor’s mandate. “IDEM has identified several opportunities to clarify or rescind existing policies and regulations, and intends to complete the additional reviews identified above and submit additional reports …”\n\nThe agency said it also hopes to collaborate with its federal counterparts to find ways to meet Braun’s orders. Another half dozenexecutive ordersimpact IDEM’s operations, including ones related to supporting coal generation and advancing nuclear development.\n\nCarpenter criticized the former for being “more expensive … (and the) dirtiest form of energy” that doesn’t meet sustainability or affordability goals set in state statute.\n\n“It’d be interesting to the pose the question to some of the utilities, ‘Would it be burdensome to you to keep open a coal plant that you had scheduled to close?’” posited David Van Gilder, the senior policy and legal director of the Hoosier Environmental Council.\n\nIn a Tuesday release, Braun painted his actions as business-friendly, saying they would create jobs and economic growth while balancing “responsible environmental protection and stewardship.”\n\n“Government naturally drifts toward over-regulation, and it’s important to go through these regulations to make sure they aren’t stifling innovation and raising the cost of living for no benefit,” Braun said. “My agencies have been directed to identify regulations that are raising the cost of living without benefiting our environment so they can be changed or rescinded; we can grow our economy while also safeguarding Hoosiers’ health and preserving our natural resources.”\n\nWe need to unleash the productive side of our economy, while protecting and preserving our state’s natural resources.\n\n– Gov. Mike Braun\n\nBut the report and environmental advocates noted that Indiana’s environmental regulations have been curtailed for decades, leaving little for IDEM to revisit or eliminate.\n\nRescinding certain rules will be a lengthy process, the agency added, because it will need approval from the Environmental Rules Board, a period of public comment and a regulatory analysis.\n\nAt least two actions would need to go through the rule reversal process but may not need any federal approval, according to IDEM.\n\nCurrent state law requires resubmitting underground storage tank notification forms for any change — beyond federal rules surrounding ownership changes or new tank installations. If not properly maintained, tanks can leak, contaminating the ground and nearby water sources.\n\nIDEM also wasn’t sure if eliminating or revising requirements for submitted emissions reduction plans following malfunctions would require federal approval. But this rule depends on the source, and thus could be modified to be less burdensome, the agency said.\n\nJust one change — allowing fire departments to conduct burns for training purposes without prior approval — would explicitly need the federal government to approve a revised state plan.\n\nThe state agency did identify a handful of rules that wouldn’t require any federal action, such as streamlining the permit schedule for pollution discharge elimination and allowing “appropriate feedstock” only in permitting.\n\nRules for the first are inconsistent throughout the state, differing between water in the Great Lakes basin and downstate waters. Rather than having some areas with three-year schedules, IDEM recommended clarifying the state statute to allow for five-year schedules that align with the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nRead thefull report.\n\nAs for the latter, current code requires a land application permit for appropriate feedstock waste but not for waste that’s a mix of appropriate feedstock and biomass — or only biomass — when it comes to certainclasses of crops.\n\nAlso in terms of permitting, solid and hazardous waste permits currently range from three to five years, but could be expanded to 10 to “reduce paperwork burdens … and improve Indiana’s competitiveness.” The agency is already reviewing this as part of an unrelated review of its fees.\n\nAnd while the federal government doesn’t dictate the state’s requirements for certain tax deductions, IDEM also noted that it didn’t have expertise in this area either. The agency determines if certain systems or devices qualify for tax deductions — an “unnecessary” requirement that officials say could be moved to another entity.\n\nThe state division devoted to electronic waste registration and recycling is limited to the expenses of administering the associated fund, but state statute could expand that authority in a way that enhances collection activities, according to IDEM.\n\nThe 10th and final recommendation would seek to codify some of IDEM’s policies.\n\nThe agency received thousands of public comments and included two dozen in the Tuesday report.\n\n“I’m really looking forward to seeing the release of those comments,” said Van Gilder. “It’s important that our elected officials represent us and those concerns and there is a lot of concern (around) having environmental protections in place.”\n\nCarpenter added that he’d like to see unfiltered comments that weren’t “hand-picked” for the report.\n\nThough Braun railed against states with stricter environmental regulations than federal standards — saying he believed the nationwide requirements are an “appropriate baseline” — Indiana hasn’t been in that category in years.\n\nCONTACT US\n\nLike many states, Indiana has “no more stringent than” lawsthat align the state’s ruleswith the federal government, including air and water quality protections — as reflected in IDEM’s report.\n\n“… (IDEM) anticipates, based on prior review with related executive orders, that this universe of regulations is relatively small,” the accompanying letter summarized. “Indiana Code, as well as previous Gubernatorial administrations, have limited IDEM’s ability to promulgate rules that are more restrictive than federal regulations for decades.”\n\nCiting this, the state agency said it would identify specific federal rules requiring regulations that potentially clash with Braun’s order and work with the appropriate federal agencies to identify solutions.\n\nBut the EPA has also beena target for criticismand deregulation at the federal level, meaning that their rules could change as well — triggering a potential ripple effect in Indiana.\n\n“The fact that there is this significant push to roll back environmental protections on the federal level undermines the alignment that we current have,” Carpenter said. “It’s really important for the state to be independent and be able to make independent guidelines.”\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_title":"Governor signs budget in early morning to secure Medicaid funds",
    "News_text":"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers signed a new two-year budget in the early morning hours Thursday in a race against Congress to ensure the state gets afederal Medicaid matchthat it would lose under PresidentDonald Trump'stax and spending cuts package.\n\nIn an extraordinarily rapid succession of events, Evers and Republican lawmakers unveiled acompromise budget dealon Tuesday, the Senate passed it Wednesday night and just before 1 a.m. on Thursday, the Assembly passed it. Evers signed it in his conference room minutes later.\n\nDemocrats who voted against the $111 billion spending bill said it didn't go far enough in meeting their priorities of increasing funding for schools, child care and expanding Medicaid. Evers, who hasn't decided on whether he will seek a third term, hailed the compromise as the best deal that could be reached.\n\n“I believe most Wisconsinites would say that compromise is a good thing because that is how government is supposed to work,” Evers said.\n\nWisconsin’s budget would affect nearly every person in the battleground state. Income taxes would be cut for working people and retirees by $1.4 billion, sales taxes would be eliminated on residential electric bills, and it would cost more to get a driver’s license, buy license plates and title a vehicle.\n\nUnprecedented speed\n\nThere was urgency to pass the budget because of one part that increases an assessment on hospitals to help fund the state’s Medicaid program and hospital provider payments. Medicaid cutsup for final approvalthis week in Congress cap how much states can get from the federal government through those fees.\n\nThe budget would increase Wisconsin’s assessment rate from 1.8% to the federal maximum of 6% to access federal matching funds. But if the federal bill is enacted first, Wisconsin could not raise the fee, putting $1.5 billion in funding for rural hospitals at risk.\n\nIn the rush to get done, Republicans took the highly unusual move of bringing the budget up for votes on the same day. In at least the past 50 years, the budget has never passed both houses on the same day.\n\n“We need to get this thing done today so we have the opportunity to access federal funding,” Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said at the start of debate just before 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nGovernors typically take several days to review and sign the budget after it’s passed, but Evers took just minutes.\n\nBipartisan compromise\n\nIn a concession to the Democratic governor, Republicans agreed to spend more money on special education services in K-12 schools, subsidize child care costs and give the Universities of Wisconsin its biggest increase in nearly two decades. The plan would likely result in higher property taxes in many school districts due to no increase in general aid to pay for operations.\n\nRepublicans needed Democratic votes\n\nThe Senate passed the budget 19-14, with five Democrats joining with 14 Republicans to approve it. Four Republicans joined 10 Democrats in voting no. The Assembly passed it 59-39 with six Democrats in support. One Republican voted against it.\n\nDemocratic senators were brought into budget negotiations in the final days to secure enough votes to pass it.\n\n“It’s a bipartisan deal,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein said before the vote. “I think everybody left the table wishing it was different, but this is something everyone has agreed on.”\n\nDemocrats said newly drawn legislative maps, which helped thempick up seatsin November and narrow the Republican majorities, led to greater compromise this year.\n\n“That gave us leverage, that gave us an opportunity to have a conversation,” Democratic Sen. Mark Spreitzer said.\n\nStill, Spreitzer said the budget “fell far short of what was needed on our priorities.” He and other Democrats said it didn’t go far enough to help fund child care, K-12 schools and higher education, in particular.\n\nEvers vetoes prison closure deadline\n\nThe budget called forclosing a troubled aging prisonin Green Bay by 2029, but Evers used his partial veto to strike that provision. He left $15 million in to support the closure, but objected to setting a date without a clear plan for getting it done.\n\nThe governor noted in his veto message that the state has “painful experience” with trying to close prisons without a fleshed-out plan, highlighting that the state's youth prison remains open even though lawmakers passed a bill to close the facility in 2017.\n\n“Green Bay Correctional Institution should close — on that much, the Legislature and I agree,” Evers wrote. “It is simply not responsible or tenable to require doing so by a deadline absent a plan to actually accomplish that goal by the timeline set.”\n\nJim Rafter, president of the village of Allouez, the suburb where the prison is, issued a statement Friday saying the veto shows how broken the state government has become.\n\n“The time for studying has come and gone,” he said. “The Village of Allouez and our community demand action and the certainty they deserve about when this facility will be closed.”\n\nGovernor kills grant as payback for ending stewardship\n\nEvers used his partial veto powers to wipe out provisions in the budget that would have handed the town of Norway in southeastern Wisconsin an annual $100,000 grant to control water runoff from State Highway 36. The governor said in his veto message that he eliminated the grant because Republicans refused to extend the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship Program.\n\nThat program provides funding for the state and outside groups to buy land for conservation and recreation. Republicans have complained for years that the program is too expensive and removes too much land from property tax rolls, hurting municipalities. Funding is set to expire next year. Evers proposed allocating $1 billion to extend the program for another decade, but Republicans eliminated the provision.\n\nEvers accused legislators in his veto message of abandoning their responsibility to continue the program while using the runoff grant to help “the politically connected few.” He did not elaborate.\n\nThe town of Norway lies within state Rep. Chuck Wichgers’ and Sen. Julian Bradley's districts; both are Republicans. Bradley, who sits on the Legislature's powerful budget-writing committee, called the veto “nothing more than political retribution.” Wichgers didn't return a voicemail.\n\nRep. Tony Kurtz and Sen. Pat Testin, both Republicans, introduced a bill last month that would extend the stewardship program through mid-2030, but the measure has yet to get a hearing.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Todd Richmond contributed to this report.",

    "News_text":"The TSLY ETF is a YieldMax product that uses options strategies to generate income from Tesla stock.\n\nAs of the latest information, the ETF yields more than 100%.\n\nThere’s a lot more to consider than just the yield before you decide to invest.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Tidal Trust II - YieldMax Tsla Option Income Strategy ETF ›\n\nMany ETFs have come onto the market recently that use various options strategies to boost income. For example, some ETFs use covered call strategies to produce yields of 10% or more for investors from relatively low-paying portfolios of stocks.\n\nYieldMax ETFs take this idea to the next level, using aggressive strategies to, as the name suggests, maximize yield. It's not uncommon for YieldMax ETFs to have dividend yields of 30%, 40%, or much higher in some cases.\n\nOne extreme example is theYieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF(NYSEMKT: TSLY), which uses call option strategies onTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)stock to produce a high level of monthly income. In fact, based on the past 12 months of dividends, the ETF has a dividend yield of about 127%.\n\nOf course, if something sounds too good to be true, that's usually the case. If there was an ETF that produced asustainablethree-digit yield and was likely to do so for the foreseeable future, we'd all be scrambling to buy shares. But in this case, there are quite a few caveats and important things to know before you consider investing.\n\nIt might surprise you to learn that the majority of the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF's assets are inU.S. Treasuries. It uses these as collateral to buy and sell options on the stock, which are typically near the current share price. For example, the largest non-Treasury position in the portfolio is July 2025 call options with a $340 strike price. Some of the positions are long, some are short (meaning the ETF sold options), and there are some put options in the portfolio as well.\n\nThe general goal with the options positions is to create the highest stream of income relative to the risk level as possible.\n\nThere are two big risk factors to consider. First, and less significant, is the inconsistency of the monthly dividend payments you'll get. Over the past 12 months, the distributions from this ETF have been as high as $1.29 or as low as $0.40.\n\nThe bigger issue is that the stock price itself has a downward bias over time. In short, if the price of Tesla stock goes up, the ETF's options strategies severely limit the upside potential. On the other hand, if the stock falls, it can result in large losses. In fact, since the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF was formed in late 2022,Tesla stockhas risen by 92%. Shares of this ETF havefallenby 78%, and there's even been a reverse split along the way.\n\nOf course, even with a modestly declining share price, an ETF like this can still be a winner. In other words, if the ETF declines by say, 30%, but pays a 100%-plus yield, it's still a great investment. But that hasn't been the case. In fact, including dividends, this ETF has generated a 26% total return for investors since its 2022 inception. That's 52 percentage points worse than if you had simply bought Tesla stock and held on to it.\n\nIn a nutshell, YieldMax ETFs produce the best total returns compared with simply buying the underlying stock in times when the stock is mostly flat for an extended period, without any massive price swings. And if you look at virtuallyanychart of Tesla's historic stock performance, you'll see that doesn't really describe its typical price action.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you think Tesla stock is going to be stuck in a narrow price range for a while, the YieldMax Tesla Option Income Strategy ETF could be a good way to play it. Just be aware that this and other YieldMax ETFs aren't magical income instruments and are more likely than not to produce underperforming total returns over time.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tidal Trust II - YieldMax Tsla Option Income Strategy ETF, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Tidal Trust II - YieldMax Tsla Option Income Strategy ETF wasn’t one of them.

    "News_title":"Military force may have delayed Iran’s nuclear ambitions – but history shows that diplomacy is the more effective nonproliferation strategy",
    "News_text":"While the U.S. military’s strikes on Iran on June 21, 2025, are believed to have damaged the country’s critical nuclear infrastructure, no evidence has yet emerged showing the program to have been completely destroyed. In fact, an earlyU.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessmentsurmised that the attack merely delayed Iran’s possible path to a nuclear weapon by less than six months. Further, Rafael Mariano Grossi, director of the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency, stated that Iranmay have moved its supply of enriched uraniumahead of the strikes, and assessed that Tehran could resume uranium enrichment “in a matter of months.”\n\nOthers have warned that the strikes mayintensify the Islamic Republic’s nuclear drive, convincing the government of the need to acquire a bomb in order to safeguard its survival.\n\nAs ascholar of nuclear nonproliferation, my research indicates that military strikes, such as the U.S. one against Iran, tend not to work. Diplomacy — involving broad and resolute international efforts — offers a more strategically effective way to preempt a country from obtaining a nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe strategy of a country using airstrikes to attempt to eliminate a rival nation’s nuclear program has precedent, includingIsrael’s 1981 airstrike on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactorand its2007 air assault on Syria’s Kibar nuclear complex.\n\nYet neither military operation reliably or completely terminated the targeted program. Many experts of nuclear strategy believe that while the Israeli strike destroyed the Osirak complex, itlikely acceleratedIraq’s fledgling nuclear program, increasing Saddam Hussein’s commitment to pursue a nuclear weapon.\n\nIn a similar vein, while Israeli airstrikes destroyed Syria’s nascent nuclear facility,evidence soon emergedthat the country, under its former leader, Bashar Assad, may have continued its nuclear activities elsewhere.\n\nBased on my appraisal of similar cases, the record shows that diplomacy has been a more consistently reliable strategy than military force for getting a targeted country to denuclearize.\n\nThe tactics involved in nuclear diplomacy include bilateral and multilateral engagement efforts and economic tools ranging from comprehensive sanctions to transformative aid and trade incentives. Travel and cultural sanctions – including bans on participating in international sporting and other events – can also contribute to the effectiveness of denuclearization diplomacy.\n\nThe high point of denuclearization diplomacy came in 1970, when the majority of the world signed theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The treaty obliged nonnuclear weapons states to refrain from pursuing them, and existing nuclear powers to share civilian nuclear power technology and work toward eventual nuclear weapons disarmament.\n\nI’ve found that in a majority of cases since then – notably in Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan – diplomacy played a pivotal role in convincing nuclear-seeking nations to entirely and permanently relinquish their pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nIn the cases of U.S. allies Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and Taiwan, the military option was off the table for Washington, which instead successfully used diplomatic pressure to compel these countries to discontinue their nuclear programs. This involved the imposition of significant economic and technological sanctions on Argentina and Brazil in the late-1970s,which substantially contributed to the denuclearization of South America. In the South Korea and Taiwan cases, the threat of economic sanctions was effectively coupled withthe risk of losing U.S. military aid and security guarantees.\n\nSouth Africa represents one of the most compelling cases in support of diplomatic measures to reverse a country’s nuclear path. In the latter years of the Cold War, the country had advanced beyond threshold nuclear potential to assemble asizable arsenal of nuclear weapons. But in 1991, the country decided to relinquish that arsenal, due in large part to thehigh economic, technological and cultural costs of sanctionsand the belief that its nuclear program wouldprevent its reintegration into the international communityfollowing years of apartheid.\n\nCompleting the denuclearization of Africa, diplomatic pressure applied by the U.S. was the primary factor in Libya’s decision toshutter its nuclear program in 2003, asending U.S. sanctions and normalizing relations with Washington became a high priorityfor the government of Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nIn the case of Iraq, the Hussein regime eventually did denuclearize in the 1990s, but not through a deal negotiated directly with the U.S. or the international community. Rather, Hussein’s decision was motivated by the damaging economic and technologicalcosts of the U.N. sanctions and his desire to see them liftedafter the first Gulf War.\n\nIn the 11 countries in which diplomacy was used to reverse nuclear proliferation, only in the cases of India and Pakistan did it fail to induce any nuclear reversal.\n\nIn the case of North Korea, while Pyongyang did for a time join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it later left the accord and subsequently built an arsenal now estimated atseveral dozen nuclear weapons. The decades-long efforts at diplomacy with the country cannot, therefore, be coded a success. Still, these efforts didresult in notable moves in 1994 and 2007 by North Korea to curtail its nuclear facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts debate whether diplomacy would have been more successful at containing North Korea’s nuclear program if the George W. Bush administration had not shifted toward a more confrontational policy, includingnaming North Korea as a member of the “axis of evil”anddelaying aid promised in the 1994 U.S.-North Korean Agreed Framework.\n\nConsistent with the historical track record for diplomacy concerning other nuclear powers, Iran offers compelling evidence of what diplomacy can achieve in lieu of military force.\n\nDiplomatic negotiations between the U.S, Iran and five leading powers yielded the landmarkJoint Comprehensive Plan of Actionin 2015. The so-called Iran deal involved multilateral diplomacy and a set of economic sanctions and incentives, and persuaded Iran to place stringent limits on its nuclear program for at least 10 years and ship tons of enriched uranium out of the country. A report from the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2016 confirmed thatIran had abided by the terms of the agreement. Consequently, the U.S., European Union and U.N. responded by lifting sanctions.\n\nIt was only after President Donald Trump ordered theU.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2018, and reimposed sanctions on Iran, that Tehran resumed its alarming enrichmentactivities.\n\nTrump signaled quickly after the recent attack on Iran a willingness to engage in direct talks with Tehran. However, Iran may rebuff any agreement that effectively contains its nuclear program, opting instead for the intensified underground approach Iraq took after the 1981 Osirak attack.\n\nIndeed, my research shows that combining military threats with diplomacy reduces the prospects of successfully reaching a disarmament agreement. Nations will be more reluctant to disarmwhen their negotiating counterpart adopts a threatening and combative posture, as it heightens their fear that disarmament will make it more vulnerable to future aggression from the opposing country.\n\nSuccessful denuclearization diplomacy with Iran will not be a panacea for Middle East stability; the U.S. will continue to harbor concerns about Iran’s military-related actions and relationships in the region.\n\nIt is, after all, unlikely that any U.S. administration could strike a deal with Tehran on nuclear policy that would simultaneously settle all outstanding issues and resolvedecades of mutual acrimony.\n\nBut by signing and abiding to the terms of the JCPOA, Iran has demonstrated a willingness to cooperate on the nuclear issue in the past. Under the agreement, Iran accepted a highly limited and low-proliferation-risk nuclear program subject to intrusive inspections by the international community.\n\nThat arrangement was beneficial for regional stability and for buttressing the global norm against nuclear proliferation. A return to a JCPOA-type agreement would reinforce a diplomatic approach to relations with Iran and create an opening for progress with the country on other areas of concern.\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "News_text":"India isimposing further restrictionson Bangladeshi exporters, preventing them from shipping certain materials including woven fabrics, jute and flax yarn through its land ports.\n\nThe move, established by the country’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade on Friday, follows the decision in May to halt Bangladesh’sreadymade garments (RMGs), cotton and cotton yarns from entering the country via the land ports. That ban also excluded items such as processed foods, plastics and wooden furniture.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n\nStrike at Bangladesh's Busiest Port Paralyzes Trade, Threatens $222M Hit to Garment Industry\n\nLong Excluded in Climate Conversations, Fashion's Suppliers Create Own Seat at Table\n\nIndia Eyes Top Spot in Global Apparel Race. Can It Topple Bangladesh and Vietnam?\n\nThe new list of restricted items is currently comprised of jute goods, hemp yarn, jute single yarn, twisted yarn, woven fabrics and unbleached jute fabrics.\n\nThese imports will only be allowed entry into India using ocean freight via theNhava Sheva Port(also known as Jawaharlal Nehru Port) in Mumbai. Similarly, the May edict only allowed garments to pass through the Nhava Sheva and Kolkata seaports.\n\nThe restrictions will not apply to Bangladesh exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through India. However, re-export of those goods from Nepal and Bhutan back to India will not be allowed.\n\nAs the countries’ relationship has declined since the ouster ofPrime Minister Sheikh Hasinalast August, India and Bangladesh have gone back and forth with implementing more protectionist measures when it comes to trade along the countries’ shared border. In April, Bangladesh halted theimport of yarnsentering the country via its own land ports. While that decision didn’t directly target India, 95 percent of Bangladesh’s yarn imports originate from its neighbor.\n\nThat same month, India revoked Bangladesh’s access to often-usedtransshipment services. This service previously allowed Bangladeshi exporters to ship goods across the border using India’s customs stations en route to Indian ports and airports, where the freight would be transported to third countries. However, these goods weretaking up cargo spaceon Indian airlines, further incentivizing the country to cut off access to make room for its own exports.\n\nIn a similar vein to Bangladesh’s yarn import ban, India’s actions are designed to bolster its domestic jute industry, which the country claims has been hampered by competition from duty-free Bangladeshi jute that enters its borders.Juteis a rough fiber used for making twine or rope, carrying similar qualities to hemp. The sustainable fabric can be used in the manufacturing process for bags, upholstery, carpets, packaging and even clothing.\n\n“Artificially depressed prices caused by subsidized imports have had a direct and adverse impact on the income of jute farmers,” an Indian government official told The Indian Express.\n\nConversely, Bangladesh’s exporters are now concerned of losses to their businesses, as well as the added logistics costs and transit times that they would encounter by needing to transport the fabrics exclusively via ocean freight.\n\nThe decision will affect 117 exporters who shipped goods via land routes, according to a report from Indian publication The Week.\n\n“Our jute exporters have become victims of politics, as bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India are currently strained,” Mirza Koushik Ahmed, executive director of Reliance Jute Mills Ltd., told Bangladeshi publication The Daily Star.\n\nAhmed voiced his displeasure with the choice, saying that the route to the Nhava Sheva Port was not commercially viable for exporting jute products. The port is on India’s west coast, essentially on the opposite side of the country from where it and Bangladesh share a border.\n\nFarhad Ahmed Akanda, chairman of the Bangladesh Jute Association, told The Daily Star that most of its buyers were based in Kolkata, which is only 51 miles from the Petrapole-Benapole land port on the border of both countries.\n\n“Our buyers are pursuing the Indian authorities to allow shipments through Kolkata,” he said, adding that no buyer has cancelled orders until now.\n\nAkanda noted that it would be more convenient for buyers if India allowed shipments through Kolkata’s seaport, like it is still doing with garments.\n\n“The cost for our buyers will increase because they will have to take delivery from the [Nhava Sheva] port,” Akanda said. “Besides, our cost of shipment through the Chattogram and Mongla ports will rise.”\n\nBangladesh’s total exports of jute products declined by 4.1 percent throughout the 2024-25 fiscal year, according to data released from the country’s Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) on Tuesday.\n\nOverall, Bangladesh’s total exports grew by 8.6 percent in the recently concluded fiscal year, reaching $48.3 billion, the EPB said.\n\nThe growth came despite a 7.6 percent drop in exports in June, as the Eid al-Adha holiday in early June shuttered factories and the country dealt with a scattered strike of tax and customs workers thatstopped operations at Chattogram Portfor two days.\n\nThe RMG sector continued to show global export strength with 8.8 percent growth for the year to $39.3 billion, encompassing 81.4 percent of total exports.",

    "News_title":"Iran says it is committed to NPT, slams Germany’s support for Israel",
    "News_text":"Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says Tehran is committed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), dismissing speculation that Iran would leave the accord in response to major attacks by Israel and the United States on its nuclear and other sites.\n\nAraghchi also said on Thursday that Iran will honour its safeguards agreement with the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), despite recently passing a law tosuspend cooperationwith the agency.\n\nSafeguards agreements between the IAEA and NPT signatories allow the UN agency to ensure that the countries’ nuclear programmes remain peaceful.\n\n“Iran remains committed to the NPT and its Safeguards Agreement,” Araghchi wrote in a social media post.\n\n“In accordance withthe new legislationby Majlis [parliament], sparked by the unlawful attacks against our nuclear facilities by Israel and the US, our cooperation with [the IAEA] will be channelled through Iran’s Supreme National Security Council for obvious safety and security reasons.”\n\nIt is not clear how that cooperation will proceed or when and how IAEA inspectors will be granted access to Iran’s nuclear sites.\n\nAraghchi’s comment was made in response to a German Federal Foreign Office statement decrying the Iranian legislation against the IAEA as a “devastating message”.\n\nThe Iranian foreign minister hit out at the criticism by Germany – one of Israel’s most committed allies that backed the attacks against Iran last month.\n\nAt the height of Israel’s strikes, which were launched without direct provocation, ChancellorFriedrich Merzsuggested Germany and the West are benefitting from the war.\n\n“This is dirty work that Israel is doing for all of us,” he said. The remarks earned him praise from Israeli officials and caused outrage in some other quarters.\n\nOn Thursday, Araghchi rebuked “Germany’s explicit support for Israel’s unlawful attack on Iran, including safeguarded nuclear sites, as ‘dirty work’ carried out on behalf of the West”.\n\nHe also accused Berlin of repudiating its commitments under the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal with Tehran by demanding zero enrichment by Iran.\n\nThe pact – which US PresidentDonald Trumptorpedoed during his first term in 2018 – allows Iran to enrich uranium at a low grade under a strict monitoring regime.\n\n“‘Iranians were already put off by Germany’s Nazi-style backing ofGenocide in Gaza, and its support for Saddam’s war on Iran by providing materials for chemical weapons,” Araghchi said in a post on X.\n\n“The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbours anything but malice towards Iranians.”\n\nCompanies from the former West Germany have long been accused by Iran of helping late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein develop chemical weapons, which he used against Iranian forces during the war between the two countries in the 1980s.\n\nIran has been calling on Germany to investigate its ties to Iraq’s chemical weapons, but Berlin has not publicly acknowledged any role in the programme.\n\nGermany and other European countries came out in support of Israel in its recent 12-daywar with Iran, which killed hundreds of Iranian civilians, including nuclear scientists and their family members, as well as top military officials.\n\nThe US joined the Israeli campaign last month, bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran retaliated against the US attack with a missile strike against an airbase in Qatar where US soldiers are stationed. Hours later, a ceasefire was reached.\n\nIranian officials have sharply criticised the IAEA not only for failing to condemn the Israeli and US strikes but also for passing a resolution on June 12 accusing Tehran of noncompliance with its nuclear obligations, the day before Israel attacked.\n\nInternational law offers special protection to nuclear sites due to the high risk of an environmental disaster if attacks result in the leak of radioactive material.\n\nThe state of the Iranian nuclear programme after the US and Israeli strikes remains unclear.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon said the US bombing operation set back Iran’s nuclear programme byone to two years.\n\nBut IAEA chiefRafael Grossirecently said Iran could be enriching uranium again in a “matter of months”. Enrichment is the process of enhancing the purity of radioactive uranium atoms to produce nuclear fuel.\n\nIran has repeatedly denied seeking a nuclear weapon while Israel is widely believed to possess an undeclared nuclear arsenal of dozens of atomic bombs.",

    "News_text":"The US Army secretary and a top general told BI about the service's plans for what it flies.\n\nIn the coming years, the Army wants to operate far more unmanned aircraft than manned.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants the Army to reduce its crewed attack helicopter force and replace it with drones.\n\nUS Army leadership told Business Insider it wants to be flying a lot more uncrewed aircraft than crewed ones in the coming years. We are talking about a tremendous increase in the number of drones.\n\nIts ambitions, which align withgoals outlined by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's recent directive, come from a vision for what Army officials and the Trump administration have described as a more lethal force ready for future warfare.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider,US Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscolland Gen. James Rainey, the commanding general of Army Futures Command, said that unprecedented changes in warfare are fueling plans to overhaul what the Army flies.\n\n\"We believe there's a role for some manned aircraft,\" Rainey explained, \"Big picture-wise, right now, about 90% of the things we're flying have humans in them and 10% don't. And I believe over the next several years, we would like to invert that.\"\n\nThe plans to give every division 1,000droneswithin the next two years, he added, speak to the \"aggressiveness\" with which the Army is going after the new uncrewed objectives.\n\nEarlier this year, Hegseth sent out a memo on strategic transformations within the Army, laying out goals and timelines for the service, including force restructuring and cuts to certain programs and systems that altogether represent one of the largest Army revamps since the end of the Cold War. The push is estimated to cost around $36 billion over the next five years.\n\nIn the memo, Hegseth indicated that crewed attack helicopter formations would be reduced, restructured, and augmented with drone swarms capable of overwhelming adversaries.\n\nDriscoll said this big change, along with others identified in the DoD memo, is already underway and largely focused on examining what systems no longer make sense in the context of the Army's vision for its future and what systems will replace them.\n\nHe mentioned theAH-64D Apache attack helicopteras one platform that no longer aligns with plans for the transformation of the force. \"The flying costs on that were $10,000 an hour,\" the secretary said of the older Deltas, pointing out that the figure is about twice the cost of the newer Echo variant of the aircraft.\n\n\"Those are the kinds of decisions that I think we had let linger and fester for too long as an Army for all sorts of reasons,\" Driscoll said. \"What we are trying to do is take a hard look at these things,\" he explained, and decide whether they align with what the warfighter needs.\n\nLast month, Lt. Gen. Joseph Ryan, the Army's deputy chief of staff for operations, plans, and training, said that the Deltas are no longer \"a war-winning capability that we can fight with and win today.\" Even the more advanced Echos, he said, are \"on the cusp of being capabilities where we don't necessarily see them contributing to the fight the way they have done perhaps in the past.\"\n\nThe Army plans to shelve the Delta variant and further examine other crewed aircraft that may no longer be sufficiently effective. It is also reviewing other helicopter models and plans to reduce the number of helos operated.\n\nMore broadly, uncrewed aircraft are being seen as alternatives that soldiers cansend forward on the battlefieldto do missions that crewed aircraft have traditionally done.\n\nThere's still a place for crewed aircraft in the Army. Some helicopters, for example, still boast value for landing troops behind or around enemy positions to surprise and surround them. Butfuture operations are expected to be a whole lot more robotic, with an Army aviation portfolio that more heavily relies on unmanned systems integrated with manned ones.\n\nThe Army sees itself at a turning point. Senior defense officials appointed by President Donald Trump have called out what they see as excessive spending, outdated systems and weapons, and a need to expedite changes to be prepared to deter or fight a future conflict. It's part of efforts to maximize readiness,increase lethality, and get soldiers what they need most.\n\nSuch aims aren't entirely new, though, and execution will be key. During the previous administration, for instance, the Army was already discussing the need for more uncrewed systems and changes to its aircraft fleet, especially with the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program.\n\nLast year, Rainey told lawmakers that for scouting and recon missions \"the right thing to do is to use unmanned systems and not put humans in harm's way.\"\n\nA major motivator for many of the ongoing transformation efforts is China, which the Pentagon has referred to as a pacing challenge. Officials and lawmakers in Washington seeChina's meteoric military growth and modernizationand are pursuing capabilities that will allow the US military to deter aggression and, if necessary, overcome that rapidly evolving fighting force in armed combat.\n\nDrones, from pocket-sized aircraft to quadcopters to bigger warfighting assets, are a key part of these efforts, providing a range of combat capabilities en masse for a relatively low cost compared to some other US weapons programs.\n\nThe Pentagon has been working to expedite the development and deployment of uncrewed aerial systems across the services, recognizing their value as this technology sprints onto the scene in big ways. Army soldiers have been testingdifferent types of reconnaissance and strike drones are being tested in areas like the Indo-Pacific region, learning how to adapt unmanned systems to the challenges of different missions and environments.\n\nThat's a key aspect of an ongoing \"transformation in contact\" initiative, which focuses on Army units being given free rein to use different capabilities during training and exercises to see how the systems might work best.\n\nThe value of drones, particularly the smaller systems, has been especially visible in the war in Ukraine, which Army leaders continue to study.Ukrainian operators fly dronesfor intelligence-gathering and strike missions, among others.\n\nDue to extensive electronic warfare countermeasures on the battlefield, both sides are heavily relying onfiber-optic dronesto maintain a stable connection between the operator and system while also exploring new technology, like AI-enabled drones that can resist jamming. The US is not in a similar situation, but it is looking to innovate as if it were.\n\nRead the original article onBusiness Insider",

    "News_text":"Japan’s attempt to strike a deal with the US before Donald Trump’s deadline next week has hit an unlikely sticking point: rice.\n\nAs part of the negotiations, Mr Trump has revealed he wants Tokyo to buy more American rice.\n\n“Japan, they won’t take our RICE, and yet they have amassive rice shortage,” the president posted on Truth Social this week.\n\nIn a later briefing to journalists on Air Force One, he branded the Japanese as “spoilt” for eschewing American rice, even though “they need rice so badly”.\n\nThe issue has become a major sticking point, jeopardising the prospect of a US-Japan deal ahead of Mr Trump’s self-imposed deadline to strike a deal by next week.\n\n“I’m not sure if we’re going going to make a deal, I doubt it, with Japan,” Mr Trump said. “What I’m going to do is, I’ll write them a letter saying, ‘We thank you very much and we know you can’t do the kind of things that we need. And therefore you’ll pay 30pc, 35pc’, or whatever the number is that we determined.”\n\nAmerica and Japan, which is the world’s fifth-largest economy, share around £140bn of two-way trade. Japan is one of the world’s top 10 consumers of rice, but the country has faced adomestic crisisafter the cost of the crop surged over the past year.\n\n“I have repeatedly stated that agriculture is the foundation of the nation,” Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s economy minister, told a press conference this week. “In negotiations with the United States, our stance remains unchanged. We will not engage in talks that would sacrifice the agricultural sector.”\n\nAs Japan’s lead negotiator, Mr Akazawa is tipped to make another flying visit to Washington this weekend – his eighth – as the two sides try to emulate Britain, China and Vietnam in striking an agreement with Mr Trump’s administration.\n\nIndia, South Korea, the European Union and several south-east Asian countries are also trying to get a deal over the line before the 90-day pause on US tariffs ends on July 9.\n\nRice prices have jumped fourfold in the past year. Heatwaves have hit the harvest, atourist boom has fuelled demand from restaurants, and there have been bouts of typhoon or earthquake-related panic buying.\n\nSince March, the Japanese government has released 300,000 tonnes of rice from its stockpile. But supply chain bottlenecks have prevented buyers from feeling the full benefit.\n\nThe issue has caused anger, which has put politicians under pressure ahead of an upper house election this month.\n\nIn May, Taku Eto was forced to resign as farm minister over the issue, after admitting he never buys rice because his supporters give it to him for free.\n\nJapan has steep barriers to imported rice. Only the first 100,000 tonnes of imported “staple rice” – the most popular variety for Japanese consumers – can enter Japan tariff-free.\n\nAfter that, the rice attracts a levy of 341 yen (£1.73) per kilogram. Another 670,000 tonnes is allowed for use in processed foods or animal feed, a tiny fraction of Japan’s annual domestic harvest, which is typically almost 7m tonnes.\n\nHalf of its tariff-free imports already come from the US. At a government tender for tariff-free shipments held last week, US producers grabbed more than 80pc of the available quota.\n\n“Rice imports from abroad, including from the US, have increased 120 times from a year earlier,” Shinjiro Koizumi, Japan’s agriculture minister, said this week.\n\nThe rice negotiations could stall because Americans produce long-grain rice, and the Japanese prefer short-grain.\n\nAeon, a major Japanese retailer, is trying to woo the Japanese with California-grown rice, and some Japanese restaurants are blending domestic and imported rice.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Additionally, it touted investments including Amazon’s Prime Video Pathway training program and Disney’s contribution to the new National Film and Television School expansion.\n\n“One of the benefits of a mixed ecology is that producers can strike deals both with streamers, which typically involve higher upfront fees, and with [public service broadcasters], whose terms of trade mean that secondary rights normally remain with the producer,” the report states. “We are mindful, therefore, of the importance of enabling strong inward investment given the benefits it provides for our domestic industry and wider economy, and we have no plans to introduce a levy on SVOD services.”\n\nInstead, the U.K. government said it would continue to engage with the major streamers, the independent production sector and with public service broadcasters on “how best to ensure mutually beneficial conditions for all parties.”\n\nIt also said that it strongly welcomes increased investment in U.K. content and wants to see more co-productions between SVODs and public service broadcasters, such as BBC and HBO’s “His Dark Materials” and BBC Three and Netflix’s “A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder.”\n\nAdditionally, it said it would “build on the Media Act and Ofcom’s Public Service Media review by taking action to support public service media and the wider television ecosystem.”\n\nAs part of a new £75 million “screen growth” package, the U.K. government has committed to scaling up the Global Screen Fund from the current £7 million per year to £18 million per year.\n\nIt said the increased funding will support the distribution of up to 200 films and the creation of up to 75 new international film and TV co-productions, and will support up to 175 screen businesses to develop their international capability.\n\nThe postUK Government Rejects Proposal for 5% Levy on Streamers’ Local Revenueappeared first on TheWrap.",

And I believe over the next several years, we would like to invert that.\"\n\nThe plans to give every division 1,000droneswithin the next two years, he added, speak to the \"aggressiveness\" with which the Army is going after the new uncrewed objectives.\n\nEarlier this year, Hegseth sent out a memo on strategic transformations within the Army, laying out goals and timelines for the service, including force restructuring and cuts to certain programs and systems that altogether represent one of the largest Army revamps since the end of the Cold War. The push is estimated to cost around $36 billion over the next five years.\n\nIn the memo, Hegseth indicated that crewed attack helicopter formations would be reduced, restructured, and augmented with drone swarms capable of overwhelming adversaries.\n\nDriscoll said this big change, along with others identified in the DoD memo, is already underway and largely focused on examining what systems no longer make sense in the context of the Army's vision for its future and what systems will replace them.\n\nHe mentioned theAH-64D Apache attack helicopteras one platform that no longer aligns with plans for the transformation of the force. \"The flying costs on that were $10,000 an hour,\" the secretary said of the older Deltas, pointing out that the figure is about twice the cost of the newer Echo variant of the aircraft.\n\n\"Those are the kinds of decisions that I think we had let linger and fester for too long as an Army for all sorts of reasons,\" Driscoll said. \"What we are trying to do is take a hard look at these things,\" he explained, and decide whether they align with what the warfighter needs.\n\nLast month, Lt. Gen. Joseph Ryan, the Army's deputy chief of staff for operations, plans, and training, said that the Deltas are no longer \"a war-winning capability that we can fight with and win today.\" Even the more advanced Echos, he said, are \"on the cusp of being capabilities where we don't necessarily see them contributing to the fight the way they have done perhaps in the past.\"\n\nThe Army plans to shelve the Delta variant and further examine other crewed aircraft that may no longer be sufficiently effective. It is also reviewing other helicopter models and plans to reduce the number of helos operated.\n\nMore broadly, uncrewed aircraft are being seen as alternatives that soldiers cansend forward on the battlefieldto do missions that crewed aircraft have traditionally done.\n\nThere's still a place for crewed aircraft in the Army. Some helicopters, for example, still boast value for landing troops behind or around enemy positions to surprise and surround them. Butfuture operations are expected to be a whole lot more robotic, with an Army aviation portfolio that more heavily relies on unmanned systems integrated with manned ones.\n\nThe Army sees itself at a turning point. Senior defense officials appointed by President Donald Trump have called out what they see as excessive spending, outdated systems and weapons, and a need to expedite changes to be prepared to deter or fight a future conflict. It's part of efforts to maximize readiness,increase lethality, and get soldiers what they need most.\n\nSuch aims aren't entirely new, though, and execution will be key. During the previous administration, for instance, the Army was already discussing the need for more uncrewed systems and changes to its aircraft fleet, especially with the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program.\n\nLast year, Rainey told lawmakers that for scouting and recon missions \"the right thing to do is to use unmanned systems and not put humans in harm's way.\"\n\nA major motivator for many of the ongoing transformation efforts is China, which the Pentagon has referred to as a pacing challenge. Officials and lawmakers in Washington seeChina's meteoric military growth and modernizationand are pursuing capabilities that will allow the US military to deter aggression and, if necessary, overcome that rapidly evolving fighting force in armed combat.\n\nDrones, from pocket-sized aircraft to quadcopters to bigger warfighting assets, are a key part of these efforts, providing a range of combat capabilities en masse for a relatively low cost compared to some other US weapons programs.\n\nThe Pentagon has been working to expedite the development and deployment of uncrewed aerial systems across the services, recognizing their value as this technology sprints onto the scene in big ways. Army soldiers have been testingdifferent types of reconnaissance and strike drones are being tested in areas like the Indo-Pacific region, learning how to adapt unmanned systems to the challenges of different missions and environments.\n\nThat's a key aspect of an ongoing \"transformation in contact\" initiative, which focuses on Army units being given free rein to use different capabilities during training and exercises to see how the systems might work best.\n\nThe value of drones, particularly the smaller systems, has been especially visible in the war in Ukraine, which Army leaders continue to study.Ukrainian operators fly dronesfor intelligence-gathering and strike missions, among others.\n\nDue to extensive electronic warfare countermeasures on the battlefield, both sides are heavily relying onfiber-optic dronesto maintain a stable connection between the operator and system while also exploring new technology, like AI-enabled drones that can resist jamming. The US is not in a similar situation, but it is looking to innovate as if it were.\n\nRead the original article onBusiness Insider",

    "News_title":"Alina Habba interview: Trump’s favourite prosecutor is ditching her fiery Fox persona",
    "News_text":"WhenDonald Trumpappointed his former spokeswoman and personal lawyer to be New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, few pundits expected Alina Habba to stay in the role for long.\n\nHer fiery media appearances, close loyalty to Mr Trump and lack of experience as a prosecutor made her ill-suited to the role of US attorney, ran the conventional wisdom.\n\nWhat they failed to recognise was her win-at-all-costs approach.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump moved to make her position permanent, setting Ms Habba on a collision course with Senate Democrats who have already said they will try to block her.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Telegraph on the day of her nomination, Ms Habba said she has deliberately quietened her social media feeds and moved away from outspokenFox Newsappearances.\n\n“I have intentionally taken a step away from TV. I have intentionally taken a step away from the press,” she said. “The things that I do post are strictly legal... cases that we are charging.”\n\nShe is also prepared to answer any questions about her record.\n\n“I’m happy to answer them, because nobody asks them, right?” she said. “They spin about me, but nobody ever asks me directly.”\n\nHer opponents have receipts, clips from dozens and dozens of controversial TV appearances.\n\nLast year, she launched an unusual attack onLetitia James, the New York attorney general who prosecuted Mr Trump for civil fraud. She said the Democratic prosecutor was so comfortable in court that she even took off her shoes.\n\nAt other times she has talked up Mr Trump’s chances of an unconstitutional third term, or shrugged off legal challenges to his policies setting out a controversial concept of the law: “It’s what the White House counsel says and what our attorney general of the United States says.”\n\nShe also attracted controversy after suggesting veterans who had been fired byElon Musk’s Department for Government Efficiency(Doge) were “not fit” to “have a job at the moment”.\n\nIt has won her admirers among Trump voters and in the tight-knit team around the president, but Democrats will be sure to use her words against her when it comes to her confirmation hearing.\n\nThat was her old job, she says now, when she was employed to defend the president.\n\nMr Trump appointed the 41-year-old as New Jersey’s interim US attorney in March.\n\nShe wasted no time in revamping her personal office, putting in her own cream-coloured sofas and framed newspaper cuttings, making it clear she planned to be there long term.\n\nAnd now she has a strategy for taking on the doubters, which she laid out in the course of the interview.\n\nAfter three months in the job she has a track record to defend. She has wins in the form of major drug investigations as well as the fallout from protests at an immigration detention facility, where Ras Baraka, Newark’s Democratic mayor, andRep LaMonica McIver, were arrested.\n\nHer office later dropped the criminal trespassing charges against Mr Baraka but is prosecuting Ms LaMonica for alleged assault.\n\nThe result is that New Jersey’s two Democratic senators, who have extra sway in the confirmation process, have said they won’t back Ms Habba for the full term.\n\nShe insisted that the detention centre case had been mischaracterised.\n\n“There were also several people that we didn’t charge that day, and I dismissed one of those cases,” she said. “Not because anyone told me to, because I chose not to pursue that. So when people tell me that, I frankly take offence to it.”\n\nYet her presence in Trump world and her once frequent appearances on Fox News make her a polarising figure.\n\nMs Habba was born and raised in New Jersey. She first made contact with the president when she joined his Bedminster club, close to her home and legal practice.\n\nShe quickly became akey figure in his legal teamas he fought defamation lawsuits brought by Celebrity Apprentice contestant Summer Zervoce, and the journalist E Jean Carroll, as well as civil fraud allegations made by New York’s attorney general.\n\nA Washington Post cutting from 2021 hangs on the wall. Its headline reads “To sue the New York Times and his niece, Trump turned to a low-profile attorney from New Jersey,” and it has been signed with the president’s jagged autograph.\n\n“My first hit piece,” she says, then adds: “Oh wait. 2021? No, not my first.”\n\nShe was ever present when Mr Trump was convicted of business fraud in a New York court, and became his legal spokeswoman during the campaign last year.\n\nAfter the election she was appointed counsellor to the president – the role filled by Kellyanne Conway in Trump 1.0–giving her the ear of the president and a second-floor West Wing office beside his legal team.\n\n“As counsellor to the president, it’s a great job, because you can do whatever you want to sink your teeth into,” she said, “but at the same time, I think here I have a focus that is much more suited for me.”\n\nAfter two months in the Washington swamp she moved back home to New Jersey.\n\nRumours, stoked by Democrats, hinted that she would never get beyond the 120 days of an “interim” US attorney and that Mr Trump would appoint someone else for a full term.\n\nThat did not stop Ms Habba preparing for a longer stint. One of the first things she did was order the official portraits of the president andJD Vance, his vice-president, to hang in the hallway, and bringing in her own soft furnishings for her personal office.\n\nHer social media feed, once punchy and partisan, went quiet.\n\n“You look at how much TV I used to do, and now, I won’t go on unless there’s something I really feel like has to be addressed,” she said.\n\nShe is under the weather with a cold but still manages a busy line in confessional chat. And she has just come from a succession of press conferences.\n\nIn the first she announced a major drugs bust, charging 24 members or associates of the “Sex, Money, Murder” street gang, affiliated with the notorious East Coast criminal Bloods gang for their alleged roles in afentanyl, heroin and crack cocaine trafficking ring.\n\nIn the second, she announced the first charges stemming from her new “fentanyl precursor inception strike force”.\n\nMaking the streets safer is her only priority, she says.\n\n“New Jersey has a little bit of an opportunity that I can really seize, which is that we are linked to so many major cities in this country, Philadelphia, for the south of New Jersey, New York City, right?” she says. “We have Newark Airport, we have the tunnels, we have bridges, we have ports.”\n\nThe corner office illustrates her point. The Manhattan skyline is visible to the west, and a steady stream of airliners can be seen landing at Newark Liberty International airport.\n\n“You can be incredibly effective for the surrounding major cities as well as your state,” she says.\n\nHer departure from the White House was reported in some circles as a demotion, an exiling of an ambitious figure with sharp elbows.\n\nBut in her telling – backed by insiders who say she remains tight with the president – it was an offer not an order, a chance to go back to her first career and be closer to her family who had stayed in New Jersey.\n\n“I had the ability to say I wanted to stay so no, I chose to do this,” she says. “And honestly, at the time, I didn’t realise how much I was going to love it, and I really do.”\n\nRather than saying goodbye to Chloe, nine, Luke, 11, and Parker, 18, on a Monday morning and flying to Washington for the week, she now drives the 45 minutes from home to the office each day.\n\nWhether or not she will stay in the job is now up to the Senate, where she needs a simple majority to be confirmed to the role.\n\nDemocrats have a string of questions about whether she is politicising the office, starting with an interview in March.\n\n“We could turn New Jersey red. I really do believe that,” Ms Habba told a conservative podcaster. “Hopefully while I’m there, I can help that cause.”\n\nShe points out that the interview was conducted before she was sworn in as interim US attorney, when she was still in the role of counsellor to the president.\n\nAnd she is ready to be asked about her lack of experience as a prosecutor, explaining that previous office holders have had similar backgrounds to hers and that her office is packed with lawyers with years spent prosecuting cases.\n\n“It’s a silly talking point, to be honest with you,” she says. “I think that as long as you’re surrounded by great people that will tell you exactly what the laws are, give you all the facts then all you have to do is apply law to fact and take out anything about politics.”\n\nNone of that might count, however, in the face of opposition from her two home state senators. “In her short tenure as an interim US Attorney, she has degraded the office and pursued frivolous and politically motivated prosecutions,” Senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim said.\n\nSenate custom suggests that her nomination will not move forward if they oppose it, although there are other ways.\n\nEither way, Ms Habba says she would relish the chance to defend her record and set out her case in front of senators.\n\n“I’ll tell you one thing, nobody’s ever interviewed me and been like, Oh, she’s so fake,” she says. “For better or worse, you asked me about going in front of the Senate... I will be genuinely me. I truly do not have the energy or care to be fake.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Opinion - Did Trump make us more or less safe with the strikes on Iran?",
    "News_text":"In 2004, my brother was wounded by an improvised explosive device in Iraq that was certainly built by Iran. I have no love for the Iranian regime. But after President Trump’s air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, I keep asking myself: Has Trump made us more or less safe?\n\nAfter I left the classified briefing for members of Congress on Operation “Midnight Hammer,” I fear more for our safety now than I did before.\n\nI won’t discuss what was said in the briefing, but I wish I could say the briefing by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put my mind at ease. It did not.\n\nInstead, I left the briefing more concerned than when I walked in — about our national security, the rationale for this operation, and the long-term consequences of what may well be a strategic gamble masquerading as a military success.\n\nOver my 25 years in the U.S. Army, including time as a military legal advisor in Iraq and as deputy legal advisor at the National Security Council, I’ve seen how military actions are planned, authorized and evaluated. That experience has taught me to look for clarity of purpose, honest assessments of risk and a clear-eyed strategy for what comes next. Nothing that the administration has said, publicly or privately, suggests to me that they have a strategic framework for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe administration framed the most recent operation as a decisive blow to Iran’s nuclear ambitions. “Totally obliterated” the president claimed. Yet, when pressed for clear answers, officials struggle to articulate what “success” looks like.\n\nThe objectives of “Midnight Hammer” remain frustratingly vague. Was the goal to delay Iran’s nuclear breakout capability? To coerce Tehran into future negotiations? Or was this a show of force meant primarily for domestic political consumption?\n\nThe administration cannot credibly claim a meaningful setback to their program without proof, and so far, that proof is missing. Further, with the president telegraphing the strikes a week in advance, the Iranians had plenty of opportunity to move the highly enriched uranium, leaving the nuclear material unaffected.\n\nFinally, and most critically: Has Iran’s nuclear breakout capability been meaningfully diminished?\n\nFor decades American presidents — both Democrat and Republican — have resisted the urge to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, deciding that the consequences were not worth the risks involved. Each of those administrations had reasoned that the probability of sufficiently setting back the program was insufficiently high enough to risk driving the program underground or preventing breakout.\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before. Short-term tactical wins often lead to long-term strategic problems. The1981 Israeli strike on Osirak, Iraq’s nuclear reactor, delayed Saddam Hussein’s program — but it also drove it underground. Iran’s nuclear program, already shrouded in secrecy, may now retreat further from the eyes of international inspectors. That’s not victory. That’s a harder problem tomorrow.\n\nThis is not to minimize the skill or bravery of the servicemembers who carried out the mission. They did their job magnificently. There was no other military in the world capable of doing what they did. The question is whether our civilian leadership did theirs — by asking the hard questions, setting achievable objectives and preparing for the aftermath.\n\nCongress and the American public deserve to know the rationale, the risks and the real effects of this operation. Absent that, we are left hoping that the smoke clears to reveal progress, not a deeper entanglement.\n\nWe need answers — fast. Right now, hope is all we have — and that’s not a strategy.\n\nEugene Vindman represents the 7th Congressional District of Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives.

    "News_text":"Iran does not plan to respond further to the U.S. strikes on its nuclear program, the Iranian deputy foreign minister said on Thursday — but the country still pledges to forge ahead with its nuclear development program despite the attack.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said Iran had “already responded” to the U.S. attack on its three nuclear enrichment facilities late last month,telling NBC Newsthat the country had no plans for additional retaliation in a signal of a temporary calm between the U.S. and Iran following a 12-day war between Iran and American ally Israel.\n\n“We have already responded to that,” Takht-Ravanchi said when asked if Iran planned to strike America directly in response to the U.S. attack. “As long as there is no active aggression perpetrated by the United States against us, we’ll not respond again.”\n\nIran launched a missile attack on the American Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar following the U.S. bombing. Qatari defenses successfully blocked the attack after Iran gave advance notice of the strike, a move that appeared to signal Iran’s intent to deescalate the situation after a nearly two-week war with Israel culminated in the U.S.’s direct engagement.\n\nPresident Donald Trumpprojected a correspondingly conciliatory tonein the wake of the Iranian strike, posting on Truth Social a message of gratitude for Iran’s advance warning and declaring that “they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system.’”\n\nTrump — who has promised to end multiple raging wars in his second term, as he openly angles for the Nobel Peace Prize — has claimed that the U.S. attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities were a smashing success, saying the strikes “obliterated” the facilitiesand railing against reports that the attacks only set the program back by several months.\n\nIran has remained tight-lipped about the true impact of the strikes, prompting concern that the attacks have driven its nuclear program further underground. Already, the country hasmoved to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, further shrouding its program from the globe.\n\n“The damage is serious,” Takht-Ravanchi said of the American attack, without elaborating further.\n\nIran, which claimed that it moved its uranium stockpiles in advance of the U.S. attacks, has also been unwavering in its determination not to relinquish its enrichment program, despite American demands that it do so in order to reach a nuclear deal.\n\n“Our policy has not changed on enrichment,” Takht-Ravanchi reiterated to NBC. “Iran has every right to do enrichment within its territory. The only thing that we have to observe is not to go for militarization.”",

    "News_text":"President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed their party’s sweeping tax-and-spending legislation to passage on Thursday morning, just in time to meet Trump’s self-imposed deadline of July 4.\n\nLeaders met for hours Wednesday into Thursday with members across the conference’s ideological spectrum who were adamant that the Senate-passed version did not cut enough in spending or salvage enough of Medicaid. Eventually, all but two of them folded to help pass the legislation, which would trim social safety net programs to pay for extending tax cuts, enacting new ones, and boosting spending on immigration and defense.\n\nThe 218-214 vote is a testament to Trump’s sustained sway over the conference, and Johnson’s ability to beat the odds. The duo has pushed through multiple tough votes this year — and the tax and spending cuts bill was the most difficult yet.\n\n“Every time it looked like it might die, we just didn’t give anybody that chance to let the bill go down,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters Thursday.\n\n“There were members last night saying, ‘Let’s delay the vote again. Let’s close this vote and just go home and we’ll come back tomorrow and take it up again.’ We could have done that 100 times, and we’d be here till December and probably still not have a bill,” he added.”\n\nReps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Thomas Massie of Kentucky were the only Republican opponents of the bill; every Democrat also voted no.\n\nGOP leaders’ hardest sell: fiscal hawks who were openly skeptical of the administration’s claim thatthe bill will spark enough growthto eventually shrink budget deficits, particularly after the Senate’s more expensive proposal toned down a House rollback of Biden-era clean energy tax credits.\n\nThe White House helped sway them in part by promising to tackle some of those credits using executive action. Independent analyses predict the legislation, which Trump is expected to sign on Friday, will grow the national debt by some $3 trillion.\n\n“Republicans have put together a product that has a lot of good pieces to it, but it’s falling short,” Rep. Chip Roy, one of the House Freedom Caucus members who met with Johnson and Trump to discuss their concerns,said Wednesday.\n\n“I want the Green New Scam Deal fixed, and I want us to get to the place where we’re honoring our commitments to reduce deficits. We can do those things; amend it; and send it back to the Senate,” Roy added. He ultimately voted “yes” even after pledging to abstain from a procedural vote.\n\nA senior White House official wouldn’t get into specific guarantees or assurances that were made to lawmakers, but noted there were questions over the last two days from lawmakers on “implementation, questions of interpretation, [and] questions of analysis that only administration officials are really strongly equipped to answer.”\n\n“Ultimately, we were able to come to an agreement and pass the legislation based on those conversations and mutual affirmations of our shared goals,” the official added.\n\nIt was a close call. GOP leaders held votes open for hours as they juggled concerns that weather would prevent members’ returns to Washington and, overnight, that a handful of members with outstanding concerns would prevent them from adopting the rule that set up the bill’s consideration.\n\nDespite their threats, hardliners like Roy wound up voting “yes” on that resolution. But other holdouts including Reps. Thomas Massie and Keith Self voted “no” before a multi-hour whipping operation eventually swayed them to flip their votes.\n\nThroughout their pressure campaign, House Republican leaders leaned on the possibility of again wielding the filibuster-proof reconciliation process to pass additional partisan spending packages later this Congress.\n\nTrump and top White House aides were also heavily involved in the effort to win over skeptical lawmakers: The president spent Wednesday in meetings with holdouts including moderates and House Freedom Caucus members, some of whom said afterward the administration had promised to use executive action to address their concerns.\n\nThe president became openly frustrated overnight, posting on Truth Social early Thursday that this “should be an easy yes vote” for the GOP.\n\nTrump now heads to Iowa tolaunch“the Great American State Fair” — he’s likely to tout the bill as a win for his campaign agenda while there, too.\n\nMeanwhile, White House officials are already discussing how to best message the bill, with one possibility having cabinet members, the vice president, and possibly Trump himself travel across the country to sell it to Americans, one person familiar with the discussions told Semafor.\n\nLeaders logged an early win Wednesday when Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio — one of just two House Republicans who voted “no” on the bill the first time it came to the floor out of concerns over its hefty price tag — said he’d decided to support the legislation.\n\nHe told reporters that Senate’s decisions to rein in the House’s boosted cap on state and local tax deductions, strike its proposed ban on state regulation of artificial intelligence, and pare back Medicaid more aggressively helped convince him to vote yes — despite outstanding concerns over its handling of clean energy tax credits and Planned Parenthood funding.\n\n“I do think this is probably the best thing that we can get done before we hit the debt limit” later this year, Davidson said.\n\nThe senior White House official, shortly after the bill’s passage, told reporters that the administration focused on addressing “financial impacts” in lawmakers’ districts and states as well as “how particular provisions would be implemented and administered by the administration on the Medicaid side.”\n\n“What members are looking to hear is how this affects my district in very granular terms, and administration, technical career political officials, and obviously the cabinet had worked to provide that analysis,” the official said.\n\nHouse Democrats are already laying the groundwork to hit their GOP colleagues over cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and student loans in the 2026 elections — boostedby skepticismfrom voters about the legislation.\n\nTheir campaign armsent a memo Tuesdaythat said swing-seat Republicans would be “punch[ing] their pink slip” by voting for the bill.\n\n“Every single House Democrat will stand up for your health care [and] nutritional assistance,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who held up passage Thursday morning by spending several hours on the House floor sharing constituent stories, said at a press conference before voting began Wednesday.\n\n“That is why every single House Democrat will vote ‘hell no’ against this one big, ugly bill.’”\n\nSemafor’s Dave Weigellooked in depthon Wednesdayat provisions that didn’t entirely make good on Trump’s campaign promises — but were marketed as if they did.",

    "News_text":"A nurses’ labor union has reached a tentative agreement Thursday for their 2025 contract with hospital employers in the Twin Cities and avoided a strike after nearly four months of negotiations, according to union officials.\n\nThe Minnesota Nurses Association, which represents more than 15,000 members in the Twin Cities and Duluth, announced the agreement, which adding that nurses “faced an uphill battle this year” due to hospital budget constraints.\n\nUnion officials said in a Thursday statement that those constraints are largely driven by impending federal Medicaid cuts expected as part of President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” federal spending act. House Republicansthis weekhave pushed to pass the bill. Around 1.16 million Minnesotansreceive Medicaid benefits, adding up to $12 billion in the state in 2023.\n\nContract negotiations happened with officials in seven health systems, including Allina Health, Aspirus St. Luke’s, Children’s Minnesota, Essentia Health, M Health Fairview, HealthPartners and North Memorial Health.\n\n“We are pleased to announce that Allina Health and Minnesota Nurses Association reached a tentative agreement early this morning. The settlement is now subject to ratification by union membership,” Allina Health officials said in a statement Thursday.\n\nWhile nurses in the Twin Cities have reached a tentative agreement, nurses in Duluth are prepared to strike Tuesday, with advanced practice providers joining Thursday.\n\n“Nurses have always said this fight isn’t just about contracts, it’s about safe care,” said MNA President Chris Rubesch, a nurse with Essentia Health in Duluth. “We heard from our members loud and clear: staffing levels were the number one priority in these negotiations, for the first time ahead of wages and it will continue to be a principal concern as we move forward caring for our patients in the future.”\n\nChanges and updates from the 2022 contract include new language around nurses’ breaks based on state law, tools to address workplace violence and a 3% raise in the first year, 4% in the second and 3% in the third.\n\n“We’ve been fighting an uphill battle,” Rubesch said. “The campaign may be over for now in the metro, but the fight for safe staffing and patient care is far from over.”\n\n‘Not accountable to anyone’: As insurers issue denials, some patients run out of options\n\nFDA vaccine official restricted COVID vaccine approvals against the advice of agency staff\n\nStrike to start Tuesday for health care workers at Stillwater clinic\n\nRSV vaccine access expanded to some people in their 50s, according to CDC website\n\nGun suicides in US reached record high in 2023",

    "News_title":"Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ blitz: Carrots, sticks — and a July 4 victory",
    "News_text":"President Donald Trump was up before dawn Wednesday and worked the phones on and off for 20 hours, cajoling reluctant House Republicans to push his domestic policy bill across the finish line.\n\nThe president started calling his staff and House members at 5 a.m. Wednesday — and didn’t stop until 1 a.m. Thursday, according to a White House official and a second person familiar with the conversations. Trump — withon-the-ground support at the Capitolfrom budget director Russ Vought, deputy chief of staff James Blair and the White House's legislative affairs team, led by James Braid — took a carrot-and-stick approach to whipping votes, promising executive action that would build on the legislation and threatening to use his billion-dollar political war chest to fund primary challenges.\n\nIt worked.\n\nThe president’s sweeping domestic policy bill, which reduces taxes, boosts border funding andslashes safety net programs like Medicaidand food stamps,passed Thursday afternoon— overcoming significant opposition from moderates and conservatives in both the House and Senate with a combination of political savvy andpressure tactics.\n\nThe White House, eager to note how much more successful this effort was compared to theObamacare repeal flop of 2017, is planning a 4th of July signing ceremony for the legislation, expected to be attended by the B-2 bombers who carried out the recent attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, according to a second White House official, granted anonymity to preview the event. The administration is also working on a bigger victory tour that will include the president, Vice President JD Vance and members of the Cabinet taking to the road and airwaves alike to tout the bill’s passage, the official said.\n\n“Six months in, it’s become clear: Don’t cross Donald Trump. He is now established six months in that he is going to win on everything,” said Sean Spicer, who was one of Trump’s first-term press secretaries. “It’s a mentality but it is now hopefully becoming a little bit more understood. You look at Canada the other day. The Iran strike. There’s a sense that you do not want to bet against Donald Trump.”\n\nThis account is based on interviews with seven White House officials and allies, some of whom were granted anonymity to share behind-the-scenes negotiations on the bill.\n\nJust before 9:15 p.m. on Wednesday, Trumpposted to Truth Social a call to action, saying the “House is ready to vote tonight” and that “the Republican House Majority is UNITED, for the Good of our Country, delivering the Biggest Tax Cuts in History and MASSIVE Growth.”\n\nMinutes later, House members were told they would soon move forward with a rule vote needed to advance the legislation. Both were the byproducts of an agreement between Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson that it was time to move the bill forward even as they pressed holdouts, according to the second White House official.\n\nTrump kept close watch on the board as votes rolled in, calling senior staff for updates and asking them who he needed to call. At one point, Johnson got him on the phone with a group of holdouts, and Trump was adamant about pressing forward Wednesday night to deliver the vote, the official added.\n\n“We called the rule because we knew we would have the votes but that we would have to grind out the right flanks,” the official said.\n\nThe White House used the threat of primaries — echoed publicly by the president on social media — to pressure holdouts into backing the measure. Last week’s announcement that Trump’s political operationhas built a $1.4 billion war chestahead of the midterm elections was “no coincidence,” the first White House official said.\n\nThe White House also used recent events — including the ceasefire between Israel and Iran, getting Canada to back off of a new tax on American technology companies and the promise of imminent trade deals — to create a sense of momentum and an image of the president as an unstoppable force, daring Republicans to get in his way. White House aides and allies said that Republican members would have looked particularly bad stalling the legislation as the president heads to Iowa Thursday evening to kick off a yearlong celebration of the country’s 250th anniversary.\n\nBut Trump and his advisers also offered carrots to GOP holdouts, includingpromises to the House Freedom Caucusto re-enforce what’s in the text with executive orders, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions. Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), a Freedom Caucus member, declined to disclose the nature of the commitments the White House made, saying only “we had significant concerns and so you can imagine we got significant commitments.”\n\nThe administrationhas committed to strictly enforcerules for wind or solar projects to qualify for the tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“There are provisions in the law that will be supercharged or strengthened from administrative action,” said one of the people, who is close to both the White House and Hill Republicans.\n\nWhite House aides and allies are drawing a sharp contrast between the bill’s passage and the way things played out in 2017, when Republicans failed to repeal Obamacare. In particular, they credit Blair for coordinating the White House’s political and legislative affairs teams for maneuvering the bill through.\n\nJohnson, in a closing speech shortly before the final vote, quipped that the White House’s legislative affairs office “basically lived with us the past few weeks.”\n\nPassage of the legislation, coupled witha positive jobs reportreleased Thursday morning and the possibility of trade deals on the horizon has White House aides and allies optimistic about the country’s economic outlook ahead of the midterms.\n\nThe White House and its allies said passing the legislation so early in Trump’s term will give time for its economic provisions to take effect before the midterms. Republicans have bemoaned that the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the signature legislation from Trump’s first term, came too late, in December 2017, and wasn’t in full swing by the time the 2018 midterms rolled around.\n\n“The economy’s already doing well but we could see a big propulsion in the economy now especially if he gets the trade deals done. It’s quite a renaissance,” said Steve Moore, a longtime economic adviser to Trump.\n\nThe second White House official said the White House was adamant that all of the tax cuts apply retroactively to Jan. 1, 2025, so Americans will see the impact from no taxes on tips and no taxes on Social Security when they file their tax returns in April, roughly six months before the midterms.\n\n“We demanded that. That was a White House red line from the beginning,” the official said. “We are 14 months out of the election with the complete legislative wind at our back and no gun to our head, nothing other than what we want. Nobody has any leverage.”\n\nThe White House will center its messaging around the bill’s tax cuts, border security, child care tax credits and the child investment plan, among other measures. Aides also aren’t particularly worried about attacks from Democrats on the bill’s cuts to Medicaid, feeling confident in their message that they will be able to sell the cuts to the health insurance program for low-income Americans as curbing waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nWhite House officials maintain that how Trump chooses to use his political war chest is up to him, and that he has made no final decisions. But, for now, with everyone riding high from a string of successive wins, White House allies believe it is unlikely he will devote significant time and energy to punishing those who voted no on the bill.\n\nChris Marquette and Ben Johansen contributed to this report.",

    "News_title":"Marines Axe Adoption Of Ground-Launched Tomahawk Cruise Missile",
    "News_text":"The U.S. Marine Corps’ plans tosling Tomahawk cruise missilesfromremotely operated 4×4 launcher vehicleshave come to an end. The service determined that the complete Long Range Fires (LRF) system could not be effectively used in the kinds of austere environments that it expects tobe a centerpiece of its future operations. This might have further implications for the U.S. Army, whichhas been eyeing LRFas a possible smaller and more readily deployable companion toits Typhon systemand its large tractor-trailer launchers capable offiring TomahawksandSM-6 multi-purpose missiles.\n\nThe decision to cancel the LRF program is noted in the Marine Corps’ portion of theDepartment of the Navy’s 2026 Fiscal Year budget request, which started being released last week. The Marinesfirst announcedthey were looking to field a land-based Tomahawk cruise missile capability in 2020. At that time, ground-launched Tomahawks had not been found anywhere in the U.S. military since 1991, when the U.S. Air Force scrapped its nuclear-tippedBGM-109G Gryphonvariants to complywith a now-defunct treaty. The Corps stood up its initial LRF unit – Battery A, 11th Marine Regiment at Camp Pendleton in California – in 2023, somethingTWZwas first to report.\n\n“The Marine Corps has concluded that the LRF system was not able to be employed in austere, expeditionary, littoral environments and has made the decision to terminate the program,” the 2026 Fiscal Year budget request states bluntly.\n\nNo further details are provided about how the Marines reached this conclusion. The underlying vehicle used for the LRF launcher is the Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE-Fires), an uncrewed derivative of the 4×4Joint Light Tactical Vehicle(JLTV). The Marines are continuing to field theNavy and Marine Corps Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System(NMESIS), which also uses ROGUE-Fires-based launchers, but to fire the smallerNaval Strike Missile(NSM) anti-ship cruise missiles.\n\nIt is worth noting that the LRF launcher vehicle could only carry one Tomahawk at a time before needing to be reloaded, which may have presented complications in an expeditionary environment. The Marines have publicly highlighted in the past potential challenges when it comes to reloading NMESIS launchers, which can accommodate two NSMs at once, in the field.\n\n“Marines are, again, looking at it [NSM] from [sic] different ways than the Navy has been handling it in the past,” Marine Col. Bradley Sams, the service’s program manager for Ground Weapons Systems, said during a presentation at the Modern Day Marine exposition in May. “They [the Navy] take it straight from the OEM [original equipment manufacturer] to the pier, put it on the ship, and it goes out.”\n\n“So we have to look for different methods of handling that weapons system, taking it from point A to point B, and I’d love to hear different ideas on how we could do this using the existing NSM and canister,” Sams added.\n\nDedicated resupply vehicles with trailers are integral parts of a standard NMESIS battery, per the Marine Corps budget documents. Other factors could well have played a role in the Marine Corps’ decision to terminate LRF, as well.\n\nWith NMESIS, the Marines are still set to have ground-based standoff anti-ship missile capability that also offers a secondary ability to strike targets on land. During an exercise in the Philippines earlier this year, the Corps highlighted the immense value of being able to rapidly deploy the system when it sent one of thelaunchers to an island right in the middleof the highly strategic Luzon Strait. The Strait is some 220 miles across at its narrowest, and on the other end is the island of Taiwan.\n\nUsing NMESIS launchers forward deployed on island outposts to help holdenemy naval movements at risk is exactly whythe Marines are acquiring this system in the first place.\n\nHowever, LRF had been expected to provide the Marines with an additional and far longer-ranged layer of strike capability. NSM has a substantially shorter maximum range (around 126 miles in its baseline form) compared to Tomahawk (roughly 1,000 miles).\n\nAt present, the Marine Corps does not look to be considering a different ground-based weapon system to hit targets at similar distances to Tomahawk. The service is planning to field the Army’sPrecision Strike Missile(PrSM) short-range ballistic missile, includingthe anti-ship variant now in development, using its existing M142High Mobility Artillery Rocket System(HIMARS) launchers. PrSM, at least in its current guise, which has a demonstrated maximum range of some 310 miles, still has less reach than Tomahawk. The Army is planning to develop additional versions of PrSM able to hit targetsat least 620 miles away, if not more, in the future.\n\nAs noted, there may be additional ramifications on the Army side from the Marine Corps’ decision to axe the LRF program.\n\n“There’s some interest from the Army and other services about that single-cell JLTV[-based launcher], as well, because it is a nice complement to the larger four-cell container that’s on a heavy truck,” Edward Dobeck, program director of Launching Systems at Lockheed Martin,toldTWZin April. “There have been some discussions about how to maybe make it [Typhon] lighter.”\n\nLockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the LRF launcher andthe Army’s Typhon system. Typhon, which the Army has alsodeployed to the Philippineson a semi-permanent basis, is sometimes referred to as the Mid-Range Capability (MRC) and as the Strategic Mid-Range Fires (SMRF) system.\n\n“From an MRC standpoint, you can see what that is going on in the Philippines,” Dobeck added in April. “MRC provides a very strategic asset for [use from] the Philippines to be able to provide that capability in the region.”\n\nStill, it is the Army’sexperiences with Typhon in the Philippinesthat have been driving the service to look at alternatives.\n\n“So, the Mid-Range Capability, we fielded it, we have put it into the theater, but we’re learning lessons on how we can improve the next evolutions of that,” Army Col. Michael Rose, commander of the service’s 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF) headquartered at Fort Shafter in Hawaii, said at the Association of the U.S. Army’s (AUSA) main annual conference last year. “How do we make it more mobile? How do we make it smaller? How do we make it more agile? How do we employ it most effectively and how do we sustain it? A lot of those lessons are feeding back into our RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluation] and acquisitions professionals to improve and enhance that new operational capability.”\n\nThe Marine Corps’ conclusion that the LRF system is not suitable for its expeditionary concepts of operations may now prompt additional questions about the ability to deploy and operate the larger Typhon system at forward locations. At the same time, the Army’s concept for employing Typhon does not involve distributing the launchers to very remote locales as the Marines intended to do with LRF.\n\nIn acontracting notice put out last month, the Army did express additional interest in a potential new uncrewed launcher vehicle capable of firing Tomahawks, as well asPatriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement(PAC-3 MSE) surface-to-air missiles, based on the 10×10M1075 Palletized Loading System(PLS) truck.\n\nIn the meantime, the Army’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget shows the service is still pressing ahead with Typhon in its current form, but is only planning to order a very small number of missiles for those systems – just seven Tomahawks and six SM-6s – in the upcoming fiscal cycle. Interestingly, the budget documents also say the Army is shifting to purchase only anti-ship optimizedMarine Strike Tomahawk(MST) variants for Typhon going forward. MST, which retains a land-attack capability, is one of three versions of the latest Block V Tomahawk, the others being the baseline type and one with an advanced warhead design. Whether the service expects to purchase additional Tomahawks and\/or SM-6s through other funding streams is not immediately clear.\n\nWhatever might happen going forward on the Army side, the Marine Corps’ future is no longer set to include ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "News_title":"July Fourth's Stormy And Weird Weather: Hurricanes, Derechos, Tornadoes, Even Record Cold",
    "News_text":"The July Fourth holiday has had its share of notable storms, but also some stranger weather over the years, from hurricanes to winterlike cold.\n\nLet's take a walk through history and highlight some of these notable Independence Day weather events, starting with the day itself.\n\nEven an event as momentous as signing the Declaration of Independence didn't stop Thomas Jefferson from taking his weather observations.\n\nWhile in Philadelphia for the meeting of the Second Continental Congress, Jefferson noted morning, afternoon and evening temperatures as he had done for years. As you can see below, July 4, 1776, appeared to have very pleasant temperatures by early July standards, topping out in the mid-70s.\n\n(MORE:Weather When The US Declared Independence)\n\nJuly Fourth typically lands quite early in the season to get a U.S. hurricane landfall or strike.\n\nAccording to NOAA's historical database, there has been only one Fourth of July hurricane over the continental U.S. —Hurricane Arthur in 2014.\n\nArthur's center moved over the Outer Banks of North Carolina on the morning of July 4, 2014, with storm surge, high winds and flooding rain after it made landfall just before midnight.\n\nThe only other Atlantic hurricane I could find that struck land on a past July 4 was Category 1 Alice in 1973, whose eastern eyewall clipped Bermuda withrelatively little damage. Alice was the first — and remains the only — July hurricane to strike Bermuda.\n\nAmong a handful of July Fourth tornadoes last year, a brief EF1 damaged a church and downed trees on the west side of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nSince 1950, there have been253 July Fourth tornadoesin the U.S., according to NOAA's Storm Events Database.\n\nTwo of those tornadoes were violent, each rated F4 (prior to theEnhanced Fujita scaleimplemented in 2007).\n\nOne tore a nearly 30-mile path across the northern suburbs of Detroit in 1957 from near Brighton to Wixom and Madison Heights, miraculously with only six injuries.\n\nAnother in Grant County, North Dakota, in 1978 heavily damaged the town of Elgin, killing five and injuring another 35.\n\nPrior to 1950, two other F4 tornadoes struck Washington, Kansas, in 1932 and an area south of Columbus, Nebraska, in 1945. Each of these claimed seven lives.\n\nIndependence Day has a notorious history ofderechos, a widespread, damaging wind event produced from lines of thunderstorms stretching hundreds of miles.\n\nThe deadliest of these swept through far southeast Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania on the night of July 4, 1969. Gusts up to 104 mph downed thousands of trees and overturned over 100 boats on Lake Erie as people gathered to watch the fireworks in Toledo, Cleveland and elsewhere in northern and eastern Ohio. At least 18 were killed by the wind, including falling trees and drownings in capsized boats.\n\nBut it wasn't just the winds. Training bands of heavy rain formed overnight, wringing out up to 15 inches of rain, which triggered massive flooding that almost completely swamped Killbuck. At least another two dozen people died in the flash floods that night.\n\nOther July Fourth derechos include an 800-mile-long upper Midwest derecho in1977and one in1980that went from Iowa and Missouri late on the Fourth to Chesapeake Bay early the following evening.\n\nHeat\n\n- In 2019,Anchorage, Alaska, soared to 90 degrees, their all-time record and only time they've reached 90 degrees dating to 1952.\n\n- In 1911, it was the hottest day in New England history, according to weather historian Christopher Burt. Albany, New York, and Boston each hit 104 degrees — still their all-time records. It was as hot as 105 degrees in Maine and Vermont, and 106 degrees in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\n\nCold\n\n- In 1995, Climax, Colorado, tied the Lower 48's coldest July temperature when the town plunged to 12 degrees, according to Burt.\n\n- In 2005, Kuparuk, Alaska, set Alaska's July cold record, plunging to 18 degrees.\n\nRain and Hail\n\n- In 1956, Unionville, Maryland, picked up 1.23 inches of rain in 1 minute, a world record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\n- In 1968, a 6-inch diameter hailstone was recovered in Edgerton, Minnesota, a state record at the time, later tied on July 28, 1986. (Another huge hailstone found nearChokioon July 31, 2024,may have also tied the state record.)\n\nJonathan Erdman is a senior meteorologist at weather.com and has been covering national and international weather since 1996.

    "News_text":"BEIRUT, Lebanon, July 3 (UPI) --An Israeli drone struck a car on Thursday as it was driving along a highway at the southern entrance of Beirut, killing one person and wounding three others, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.\n\nThe Israeli Army claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that it targeted a \"terrorist\" working for Iran's Quds Force and involved in smuggling weapons.\n\nThe drone fired one first missile, but missed the targeted car on the Khalde highway south of Beirut, prompting the driver to slow down and stop on the side of the road. A second missile hit and destroyed the car, killing the driver, who was identified as Qassem al-Husseini, according to witnesses on the scene and local reports.\n\nThe Lebanese Health Ministry confirmed that one person was killed, and three others were injured.\n\nIsraeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X that the Israeli military carried out a strike in Lebanon targeting \"a terrorist involved in weapons smuggling and plotting attacks against Israeli civilians and Army forces on behalf of the Iranian Quds Force.\"\n\nThe Quds Force is an elite unit within Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, tasked with overseeing the country's foreign operations and supporting proxy groups across the Middle East.\n\nThe Israeli English-language website described the attack as an \"unusual move deep inside Lebanon.\"\n\nHezbollah's run al Manar website reported that the Israeli strike hit \"a civilian car with two missiles,\" inflicting several casualties. It gave no further details.\n\nShortly afterward, Israeli warplanes carried out at least eight strikes on suspected Hezbollah positions in valleys near the Litani River in southern Lebanon. Ambulances rushed to the targeted sites, but there were no immediate details on casualties.\n\nIsrael has continued striking southern Lebanon and other areas of the country since the Nov. 27 ceasefire accord, which was brokered by the United States and France to end a 14-month war between Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nThe ongoing strikes, which Israel claims to target suspected Hezbollah positions, have killed more than 200 Lebanese civilians and Hezbollah field commanders since the ceasefire went into effect Feb. 18.\n\nIsrael also refused to fully withdraw and retained five strategic positions inside south Lebanon and pledged to continue striking Lebanon to force the full disarmament of Hezbollah.\n\nIn line with the cease-fire agreement, the Lebanese Army has taken control of most of Hezbollah's positions and military facilities, pushing the militant group away from the border with Israel and preventing it from having a military presence south of the Litani River.\n\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun has also initiated a one-to-one dialogue with Hezbollah to discuss ways of securing its total disarmament per the cease-fire terms.\n\nHezbollah, which has repeatedly resisted disarming and insisted on Israel's full withdrawal from south Lebanon, was expected to comment on a draft document prepared by the Lebanese authorities in response to U.S. demands concerning disarming Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon.\n\nU.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Thomas Barrack, who conveyed the American. conditions during a trip to Beirut on June 19, was expected back in Lebanon next week for follow-up discussions on the matter with the Lebanese officials.\n\nThe United States also has urged Lebanon to improve ties with Syria and implement necessary and well-needed reforms to unlock funds for reconstruction and help solve its acute financial crisis.\n\nThe Hezbollah-Israel war has killed or wounded more than 20,000 people since October 2023, when it started in support of Gaza.

    "News_title":"Severe thunderstorm watch affecting 10 Massachusetts counties until Thursday night",
    "News_text":"A severe thunderstorm watch was issued by the National Weather Service on Thursday at 1:31 p.m. in effect until 10 p.m. for Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk and Worcester counties.\n\nLightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\n\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\n\nLightning safety plan:\n\nWhen venturing outdoors, it’s vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.\n\nStay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it’s a clear indication of nearby lightning.\n\nSeek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.\n\nIndoors safety measures:\n\nOnce you’re indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors.\n\nThese precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways.\n\nWait for the all-clear:\n\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n\nIt’s important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.\n\nWhen indoor shelter isn’t available:\n\nIf you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.\n\nSteer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n\nIf you’re in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n\nCamping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.\n\nDo not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\n\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\n\nRain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\n\nBeware of swollen waterways:\n\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\n\nMaintain safe driving distances:\n\nAdhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.\n\nSlow down and stay cautious:\n\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\n\nChoose your lane wisely:\n\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\n\nPrioritize visibility\n\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\n\nWatch out for slippery roads:\n\nBe extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.\n\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\n\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\n\nMind your windshield wipers:\n\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\n\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\n\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\n\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\n\nRead the original article onMassLive.",

    "News_title":"Trump World’s Wizard of Oz Problem",
    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nTo hear Tucker Carlson tell it, an American attack on Iran wasn’t just likely to precipitate World War III. It would do something worse: destroy Donald Trump’s presidency. “A strike on the Iranian nuclear sites will almost certainly result in thousands of American deaths at bases throughout the Middle East, and cost the United States tens of billions of dollars,” the conservative commentatorwrote on Xon March 17. “Trump ran for president as a peace candidate,” Carlsonaddedon June 4. “It’s why he won. A war with Iran would amount to a profound betrayal of his supporters. It would end his presidency.”\n\n“We can’t do this again, we’ll tear the country apart,”declaredSteve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and 2016-campaign CEO, when asked on June 18 about potential war with Iran. “Worth noting how rare this crossover actually is,”observedCurt Mills, the anti-war executive director ofThe American Conservative, after Carlson joined Bannon’s podcast to oppose American intervention, dubbing the pair the “two largest intellectual architects of the Trump years other than the president.” The implication: Trump was risking his base if he didn’t stay out of the Israel-Iran conflict. “I’m very concerned based on every[thing] I’ve seen in the grassroots the last few months that this will cause a massive schism in MAGA,”wroteCharlie Kirk, the head of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA. “This is a White House that is responding in real time to its coalition,” which is “revolting to show it’s disgusted with the potential of war with Iran,” MillstoldABC News on June 21. That night, Trump bombed Iran.\n\nThe U.S. strike may or may not have obliterated the country’s nuclear facilities, but it has certainly obliterated the notion that any of the self-proclaimed MAGA intellectuals, such as Carlson and Bannon, speak for the Trump movement. Far from shattering the president’s coalition, Trump’s strike on Iran brought it together, despite the loud protestations of some of its supposed elites. “This is Donald Trump’s Republican Party,” CNN’s chief data analyst, Harry Enten,saidthree days after the attack on Iran, referring to polls showing that 76 percent of GOP voters approved of Trump’s action, compared with just 18 percent who didn’t. “Republicans are with Donald Trump on this, Tucker Carlson be darned. The bottom line is he does not speak for the majority of the Republican base.”\n\n[Robert Kagan: American democracy might not survive war with Iran]\n\nThe conservative pollster Patrick Ruffini, whose 2023 book,Party of the People, predicted the shape of Trump’s victorious 2024 coalition, offered a similar conclusion. “Polling has been consistent that Republicans remain more committed to a posture of military strength—and MAGA Republicans more so, not less so, than other Republicans,” hetoldThe Dispatch. Indeed,surveysbeforeandafterthe attack found that self-described “MAGA Republicans” weremorelikely than other Republicans to back the president on Iran. In other words, Trump’s decision to strike the country’s nuclear sites didn’t just expose the Iranian regime’s empty threats of massive retaliation. It also exposed prominent commentators who have postured as tribunes of Trumpism to be pretenders to power, purporting to speak for a movement that has little interest in their ideas.\n\nWatching the president dispense with his critics, the conservative influencer John Ekdahlquipped, “Props to President Trump for being able to manage a two front war against Iran and Tucker Carlson.” But neither of these was ever much of a contest. Few jobs in Trump world are more farcical than the position of “architect” of “America First”: There are no MAGA intellectuals, just Trump and opportunistic ideologues attempting to hitch their pet projects to his brand. The self-styled thought leaders of the Trump movement are merely political entrepreneurs trying to appropriate the president for their own purposes and to recast his chaotic and idiosyncratic decisions as reflections of their personal worldview.\n\n“Considering that I’m the one that developed ‘America First,’ and considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides” what it means, Trumptoldmy colleague Michael Scherer a week before the bombs dropped. The president waswrongabout being the first to claim the mantle of “America First,” but right about everything else. “Trumpism” is not “anti-war” or “pro-worker,” “neoconservative” or “neo-isolationist,” or any other ideologically coherent category; it is whatever Trump says it is.\n\nThis has always been the case, notwithstanding the pretenses of Trump’s alleged intellectual allies. Back in 2017, Trump took office for the first time and brought along Bannon, who set up shop in the West Wing with awhiteboardfull of goals for the new administration. Less than seven months later, however, Bannon wascast outof the White House. Not long after, Trump began publiclyderiding himas “Sloppy Steve.”\n\nCarlson has followed the same trajectory. The conservative podcast host spoke before Trump on the final night of the 2024 Republican National Convention and was seen as one of the big winners when the president returned to power. But again, Trump quickly tired of his ally’s antics. “I don’t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,” the presidentsaidin response to the commentator’s criticism of his Iran policy. “Let him go get a television network and say it so people actually listen,” he added—a reference to Carlson being fired from Fox News. Trump thenmockedhis longtime associate as “kooky Tucker Carlson” on Truth Social, and laterclaimedthat Carlson called to apologize, something the latter has not denied, because whether it happened or not, he knows exactly where he stands.\n\nThe simple truth is this: There is Bannonism and Tuckerism, and perhaps, in a quiet corner of the Naval Observatory that has been repeatedly swept for bugs to ensure that the boss isn’t listening, J. D. Vance–ism. But there is no Trumpism without Trump. People in the president’s orbit are not his confidants—they are his chumps, to be used or discarded when doing so suits the principal’s purposes.\n\nCarlson seemingly knows this—and resents it. “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,” hetextedhis producer after the president lost reelection in 2020. “I truly can’t wait.” After the January 6 riot, Carlson texted: “He’s a demonic force, a destroyer. But he’s not going to destroy us. I’ve been thinking about this every day for four years.” Off the record, people like Carlson not only know that they do not represent Trump, but hold him in contempt. Why, then, do so many still take them seriously as reflections of the president’s perspective and coalition? And why does the myth of the Trump whisperer persist despite its manifest failure to explain events?\n\nFor enterprising conservatives, the utility is clear. Trump may not subscribe to any of their ideas, but he can be prodded to act on them, and in any case, he is 79 years old and serving his second term. Once he departs the scene, his base will be up for grabs among those who have managed to position themselves as its champions.\n\nFor some anti-Trump liberals, people like Bannon, Carlson, and Vance provide a perverse sort of reassurance. Trump’s opponents may find the ideologies of these men to be odious, but at least they suggest a method to the president’s madness. The presence of even a rough philosophical framework provides the false hope that what Trump will do next will be predictable and follow from first principles, rather than from haphazard impulse. Better, some may feel, to live in the realm of an evil but explicable king than in that of a demented one.\n\n[Read: The MAGA coalition has turned on itself]\n\nFinally, Bannon and later Carlson may haveplayedintothe media’sdesirefor an intellectual from their own class who could domesticate and interpret Trumpism in conventional terms. Rather than a boorish outsider winning the presidency on his own scattershot instincts, one could suppose there was a Svengali behind the scenes who had masterminded the whole affair. This belief imposed order on what appeared to be chaos, imputed logic to what otherwise looked like a personality cult, and thus rescued the prognosticating profession from a situation where its skills might no longer be of use.\n\nThe only problem with this arrangement was that the pro-Trump intellectuals and influencers were making it all up. They were the political equivalent of the Wizard of Oz, shadows behind a curtain trying to fool people into thinking that they spoke for the president and his movement. But like Oz’s projection, they were nothing more than an intimidating illusion. All it took to make them disappear was for Trump to turn on the lights.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

    "News_text":"As an attorney with close to a decade in immigration law and now focused on Everglades conservation, I vehemently oppose the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" detention center in the ecologically sensitive Everglades. This unique ecosystem, home to endangered species like the Florida panther, is a crucial contributor to Florida’s tourism economy generating $8.5 billion annually. Constructing a 1,000-bed facility, expandable to 5,000 or more, risks irreversible damage.\n\nKrome Detention Center, just 27 miles away, has all the necessary infrastructure and recently held around 700 detainees. ICE is expanding Krome with a plexiglass tent for 400 additional beds, sufficient for current needs without new construction. The proposed $450 million annual cost for \"Alligator Alcatraz\" is wasteful when existing infrastructure can be optimized and expanded further. Gov. DeSantis has invested around $3.6 billion in Everglades restoration. Building in this protected area undermines these efforts. I urge Floridians to reject this redundant project, and instead prioritize conservation and fiscal responsibility over environmental harm.\n\nValentina WeisMiele, Hobe Sound\n\nI read a reader's comments on preserving free speech. I was at my local gym, where a man was wearing a shirt that read \"F--K Israel.\" My opinion was that this shirt was provocative, offensive, and shouldn't be allowed in a gym, especially one that is located in an area with a large Jewish population. However, when I pointed it out to the manager, he told me this was protected under free speech. I asked him if it would be OK if the next day I wore a shirt with a swastika. His response was that he wouldn't like it, but he would allow it. Again, free speech. I sent an email to the corporate branch of the gym describing what had occurred. I was told it's up to the individual franchise holder of the gym to set policy. Supposedly my concerns were forwarded to the franchisee, but I never heard back from them. Everyone I have told this story to reacted the same way — extreme disapproval and concern that something like this would take place. But apparently this is where we are in 2025.\n\nIrwin Solomon, Boynton Beach\n\nThe future of the world seems better since President Trump worked with Israel to destroy Iran's nuclear program, which now appears to be eliminated. Iran is the chief sponsor of worldwide terror organizations. Iran must never be able to restart its nuclear program, missile program and sponsorship of terror. Israel is still facing threats from Iran-sponsored Hamas and Hamas still holds 50 hostages, including two Americans. Israel still faces threats from Iran and Iran-sponsored Houthi fired ballistic missiles.\n\nTo build on the success of Operation Midnight Hammer in negotiations with Iran, the US must ensure Iran is permanently and verifiably blocked from enriching uranium, its ballistic missile program is destroyed, and that sanctions relief doesn't pave the way for Iran to repair and rebuild its proxies across the region. America should use its diplomatic might to bring the hostages home and to bring Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, and other Arab and Muslim states into the Abraham Accords and forever transform the Middle East.\n\nHolly Rothkopf, Boynton Beach\n\nThis article originally appeared on Palm Beach Post:We've got Krome.

    "News_title":"Ofsted shake-up could lower house prices",
    "News_text":"Ofsted’sinspections shake-upcould lower house prices around top-performing schools, the watchdog’s chief has hinted.\n\nSir Martyn Oliver said properties come with a premium if they are located near high-achieving schools, especially those rated “outstanding” under the current Ofsted system.\n\nHowever, he suggested this was likely to change when one-word Ofsted ratings are replaced withmore “nuanced” report cardsfrom November, which will give schools colour-coded rankings across 10 different inspection areas.\n\nSir Martyn said the inspections overhaul would prove a headache for property agencies such as Rightmove, which show house-hunters the Ofsted rankings of nearby schools.\n\n“Here’s a burning question: what’s Rightmove going to do?”, Ofsted’s chief inspector told an audience at the Festival of Education at Wellington College on Thursday. “It’s a serious point. Interestingly, Ofsted is probably one of the best known regulators and inspectors in the world, let alone in this country.”\n\nThe former headteacher, who built a career turning around failing schools, added: “All those years of living at least 20 minutes away from my school, sometimes 40 minutes – I ended up sponsoring two special measures schools right where I live.\n\n“And the house prices shot up. They were both in special measures, both went to ‘outstanding’, andthe house prices went up £15,000 within a week. It does make a difference.”\n\nIn an apparent defence of the former Ofsted ranking system, Sir Martyn said it showed that “parents obviously put a value” onsingle-word judgementsof schools.\n\nResearch published by Yopa, the estate agency, last year showed properties in England close to “outstanding” schools were priced around £116,000 higher on average than those near schools rated “inadequate” – the lowest ranking under the single-word system.\n\nSimilar research by Knight Frank in 2021 found that properties in catchment areas for “outstanding” primary schools sold for 10 per cent more on average than those located further away.\n\nSchools will still be allowed to promote their one-word ratings until they are reinspected by Ofsted, which usually happens every three to four years. It is unclear whether estate agents will still be allowed to display schools’ ratings on their websites beyond that.\n\nIt comes after the school inspections watchdog faced a backlash over its plans to replace single-word judgements with newcolour-coded report cards. Under the new system, it will give schools ratings for each area of practice, ranging from a red “causing concern” up to a dark green “exemplary”.\n\nLast year, the Government announced that it was scrapping the one-word system followingthe death of Ruth Perry, a headteacher who took her own life in 2023 after an Ofsted inspection downgraded her school in Reading from “outstanding” to “inadequate”.\n\nProf Julia Waters, Mrs Perry’s sister, has been among critics of the proposed changes, saying in February that they read as if Ofsted has “fed single-word judgements through an online thesaurus”.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Sir Martyn said he had been forced to strike “a fine balance between providingso much complexityand so much nuance that schools find it stressful… or not enough nuance and not enough complexity that it does them [teachers] a disservice for the great job that they do”.\n\nBut he added that the new system would deprive the best-performing schools of the opportunity to boast about their success.\n\n“We’ve been doing something for 30-plus years in a single way,” the watchdog chief said. “If I look at my phone there will be pictures of people standing in front of their schools with balloons with an O, a U, a T – [spelling] ‘outstanding’ – and local newspapers up and down the country celebrating.\n\n“It happens all of the time, and we’re about to take that away and change it to something else that for more than three decades people are used to.”\n\nRightmove was approached for comment.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"The Russian military launched a drone attack on the Ukrainian capital Kiev and a series of other places on Thursday evening, as talks elsewhere suggested problems for the embattled country.\n\nAir defences are active on the east bank of the Dnipro River, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on Telegram as more combat drones approached the city of 3 million.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force also warned of Russian drones in other regions, including the central Ukrainian areas of Poltava, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad and the western Ukrainian region of Zhytomyr.\n\nTwo dead, three injured in latest Russian missile strike on Odessa\n\nEarlier, a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odessa left two people dead and three others injured, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nA ballistic missile with cluster munitions was fired at the port infrastructure, said Oleh Kiper, the military governor of Odessa.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said the missile was launched from the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014 and used by Moscow as a staging area for the Kremlin's troops.\n\nDue to its relative proximity to the front line, Russia frequently targets Odessa, a historic Ukrainian city on the Black Sea.\n\nThe latest strike comes just after a Russian attack on the city Wednesday night, when six people, two of them children, were injured when a drone struck a residential building.\n\nRussia advances along further part of border with Ukraine\n\nThe Russian army also said it had captured the border town of Milove in the eastern Ukrainian region of Kharkiv earlier on Thursday.\n\nThe advance is part of an operation to create a buffer zone along the Russian-Ukrainian border, the Defence Ministry in Moscow said, releasing a video showing soldiers with Russian flags on a building said to be in the village.\n\nUkraine did not initially confirm the capture but reports from the General Staff in Kiev have been mentioning Russian attacks in the area since Tuesday.\n\nThe village was not mentioned separately in Thursday evening's report but if Russia's advance is confirmed, it would mean the loss of another section of the front along the Russian-Ukrainian border for Ukrainian troops who are already under heavy pressure.\n\nDead and injured after Russian attack in Ukraine\n\nSeveral people were killed and injured in a Russian attack on a recruitment centre in Poltava, central Ukraine, the authorities said early Thursday.\n\nAmong the victims were also civilians, a statement from the Ukrainian Land Forces said. The attack caused a fire in the centre, and another strike nearby triggered a fire at a residential building, they said.\n\nThe military governor of the region, Volodymyr Kohut, posted on Telegram that two people died and 11 were injured in the attack.\n\nRussian Navy deputy head killed in Ukrainian attack onKurskregion\n\nIn Russia, Major General Mikhail Gudkov, deputy chief of the Russian Navy, was killed by a Ukrainian missile attack in the Kursk border region, a Russian official said early on Thursday.\n\nThe governor of Russia's Primorsky Krai (Maritime Territory) region on the Pacific coast, Oleg Kozhemyako, said Gudkov was killed in the line of duty by a Ukrainian airstrike.\n\nGovernor: One dead after drone attacks south of Moscow\n\nA woman was killed in drone attacks in the Lipetsk region, approximately 400 kilometres south of Moscow, Russian reports said on Thursday.\n\nFalling drone debris fell on a residential building, the governor of the region, Igor Artamonov, posted on Telegram.\n\nUkraine has been defending itself against the full-scale Russian invasion for more than three years. As part of its defensive campaign, it repeatedly targets sites in Russia.\n\nBut the casualties and damage inflicted by Ukraine are much less compared to to the devastating consequences of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyplans to talk with Trump\n\nHowever, Ukraine depends heavily on Western backing and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he hopes to speak with US President Donald Trump in the near future amid fears Washington will not deliver some weapons to his country, he said on Thursday.\n\nHe hopes to be able to talk to Trump about US support in the coming days, Zelensky said in Aarhus as Denmark assumes the rotating EU Council presidency.\n\n\"First of all: we count on continuation of American support. There are parts that Europe doesn’t have today,\" he said, mentioning missiles for patriot systems. \"This is crucial, yes.\"\n\nWashington is halting the delivery of some previously promised weapons to Ukraine, including missiles and ammunition, on concerns that the US doesn't have enough, said the reports later confirmed by the government, which said it was reviewing deliveries to ensure these matched its priorities.\n\nDenmark said European countries must compensate for any halt of US weapons for Ukraine.\n\nPutin sticks to his guns\n\nMeanwhile Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a diplomatic solution to ongoing conflicts in the world but he held onto his familiar positions during a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump on Thursday.\n\n\"He declared the Russian side's willingness to continue the negotiation process (with Ukraine),\" Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said after the one-hour conversation.\n\nBut Russia would not deviate from its goals of eliminating the cause of the conflict, Ushakov added.\n\nRussia launched the war in 2022, arguing Ukraine's accession to NATO would endanger its own national security.

    "News_text":"Ukraine is now usingbomber droneslaunched fromunmanned surface vessels (USVsaka drone boats) to attack targets in Crimea. This includes a high-value Russian radar installation on the peninsula. The strikes mark the latest iteration ofUkraine’s drone boat campaignthat’s kept Russia’s Black Sea Fleet (BSF) at bay anddamaged enemy military facilitiesin occupied Crimea as well as theKerch Bridge.\n\n“On the night of July 1 to 2, 2025, Ukraine’s Southern Defense Forces carried out a brilliant, high-precision special operation!,” the Ukrainian MoD claimed on X, adding that it destroyed three critical components of the prizedNebo-M radar system.\n\nThe 67-second video posted by the MoD shows the bomber drones launching from the bow of the sea drones and dropping several munitions on the Russian radars.\n\nUkrainian heavy drones launched from the marine drones bombard Russian radar systems in Crimea!Strikes were carried out on the components of the Russian \"Nebo-M\" radar system:•RLM-M 55Zh6M \"Nebo-M\"•RLM-D 55Zh6M \"Nebo-M\"•Radar Command Post (KU RLS) 55Zh6M \"Nebo-M\"pic.twitter.com\/fSr2zCNt8k\n\n— Special Kherson Cat\n\n(@bayraktar_1love)July 3, 2025\n\nThe use of bomber drones launched from sea drones offers some important advantages. In March,we told you abouthow the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) used first-person view (FPV) drones launched from drone boats against Russian radars and surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems. Using bomber drones gives Ukrainian operators the ability to strike more than one target per drone with possibly heavier warheads than FPV drones can carry. They can also travel farther while maintaining their connection, as they don’t have to dive to the ground to hit their targets.As we have reported in the past, Ukraine also has bomber drones that can launch guided munitions with a heavier punch.\n\nThis development was not lost on Russian military observers.\n\n“The enemy shows footage of a drone strike with drops on our positions on the western coast,” the popularRussian Two Majors Telegram channel noted. “A single (sea drone) snuck up, and drones were launched from it. A new element was the use of drones with drop systems; thus the enemy achieved several strikes from each UAV.”\n\nOne of the bomber drones launched by the sea drone was reportedly later recovered by the Russians.\n\nThe drone boat was later destroyed by Russian aviation, Two Majors claimed without providing visual proof. Still, they used this incident to seek greater resources for Russian troops in Crimea.\n\n“They know how to fight this floating junk, controlled through Elon Musk’s Starlink, in Crimea and practice it,” Two Majors posited. “You just need to give resources to effective units ready for unconventional solutions.”\n\nThe communications architecture for such a concept would include a satellite communications system on the boat, which they already carry and often multiple types at once, and a direct line-of-sight radio link from the boat to the drone. This would allow operators to control the drone in real time from anywhere, with the boat working as a platform to launch the drone and also as a relay and control node for it.\n\nUkraine’s drone boat campaign began with kamikaze variants, laden with explosives andset out on one-way missionsto hit Russian targets. Ukraine has since made a series of advancements, turning these vessels intoreusable anti-aircraft platforms, first-person view (FPV)drone launchersandeven gunboats.As we previously noted, Ukraine’s early drone boat attacks on the BSF were a “wakeup call” marking “a new point in unmanned warfare.” The lessons of its ongoing campaignhave been noted by the U.S. Navy, Cmdr. Michael Linn said.\n\nIn early May,we were the first to reportthat Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR) used its new Magura V7 USV, armed with a pair ofAIM-9X Sidewinderinfrared-guided air-to-air missiles, to shoot down a pair of RussianSu-30 Flanker fightersflying over the Black Sea. At the time, all indications were that this was the legacy AIM-9L\/M model, which seemed strange — more on that in a moment. But now we know AIM-9Xs were actually used. The Su-30 downing followed GUR’s claimed downing of a Russian Mi-8 Hip helicopter over the Black Sea in December using an adaptedR-73(AA-11 Archer) air-to-air missile fired from aMagura V5USV, an earlier variant of the Magura V7.\n\nYou can see the Magura V7 engagement with the Su-30 in the following video.\n\nWorld first: On May 2, 2025, the@DI_Ukrainespecial operations unit, in coordination with the Security Service of Ukraine and Defence Forces of Ukraine, eliminated a russian Su-30 fighter jet in the Black Sea.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/DXhg74AKcgpic.twitter.com\/Z4fP5CFRb8\n\n— Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine)May 3, 2025\n\nBeyond how the weapons were delivered, this latest attack is significant because of what was targeted. The MoD said it destroyed oneRLM-Mradar, oneRLM-Dradar and a radar control station.\n\nAs we have previously reported, the potential loss of elements of the Nebo-M radar system could have significant impacts on the ability of Russia’s forces to detect, track, and attempt to intercept various aerial threats, including ballistic missiles.\n\nThe Nebo-M first entered Russian service in 2017. It is a multi-purpose long-range radar system. Themanufacturer saysit can detect targets out to a maximum range of nearly 373 miles (600 kilometers) and claims it has at least some capability to spot and track ballistic threats and even stealthy aircraft.\n\nFrom our earlier story: “The RLM-M is a large, road-mobile 3D VHF target acquisition radar that is carried on an 8×8 truck, and reportedly has aunit cost of $100 million. TheRLM-D, which is also carried on an 8×8 truck, is a similarly large L-band active electronically scanned array (AESA) air surveillance radar.”\n\nBoth can be set up to feed targeting data, via the central command post vehicle, to various air defense systems,including S-300 and S-400surface-to-air missile systems.\n\nThe location of these radars, on the western-most tip of Crimea, is also significant. Targeted as part of Ukraine’s ongoing campaign to blind Russia, taking them out potentially opens additional holes in Russia’s air defense overlay of the peninsula and the northwestern Black Sea. This could go a long way to ensuring the survivability of standoff strike weapons, like Storm Shadow and SCALP-EG, and other attacks, such as those by long-range kamikaze drones. Given that, Ukraine has frequently hitRussian radarsandSAM systemshere.\n\nIt is unclear at the moment how many sea drones Ukraine is using to launch bomber drones. If the results of the attack earlier this week in Crimea are any indication, there is an incentive to boost this capability. It gives Ukraine another asymmetric weapon system to amplify its combat power.\n\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com",

    "News_title":"House passes sprawling domestic policy bill, sending it to Trump's desk",
    "News_text":"WASHINGTON — The Republican-controlled House passed a multitrillion-dollar package of tax cuts and spending Thursday, sending it to President Donald Trump’s desk after a tense 24 hours of negotiations and arm-twisting.\n\nThe mostly party-line vote of 218-214, which came one day ahead of Trump’s July 4 deadline, caps an arduous process that lasted more than four months, rife with ideological clashes and acrimony between the House and the Senate, where Republicans had little margin for error given their narrow majorities.\n\nIn the end, the GOP largely unified to pack the bulk of Trump’s domestic agenda into a single measure, with just Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voting against it. A bloc of Republican holdouts had initially opposed a procedural vote Wednesday to advance the bill, leading to an hourslong overnight standoff. But Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.,managed to swayall but one of them, teeing up final passage in the House.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nTrump is expected to sign the bill into law on Independence Day, marking the party’s biggest legislative accomplishment since it took full control of Washington in January.\n\nTrump applauded Republicans after the bill passed Thursday,writing on Truth Socialthat the successful effort signaled a united Republican Party.\n\n“The Republicans in the House of Representatives have just passed the 'ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT.' Our Party is UNITED like never before and, our Country is 'HOT.' We are going to have a Signing Celebration at the White House,” he wrote. “All Congressmen\/women and Senators are invited.”\n\nTrump continued the praise Thursday evening at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, organized to celebrate Independence Day.\n\n\"There could be no better birthday present for America than the phenomenal victory we achieved just hours ago when Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill to make America great again,\" he said, lauding the legislation as \"a declaration of independence from a national decline.\"\n\nThe887-page package, dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" extends the tax cuts Trump enacted in 2017 while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay. It approves hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and on carrying out Trump’s mass deportation plans. And it partly pays for all that with steep cuts to Medicaid, food aid benefits and clean energy funding. That includes an estimated $930 billion in spending reductions under Medicaid, violating Trump's promise not to cut the program.\n\nOverall, the bill is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over a decade, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office finding that the revenue losses of $4.5 trillion outstrip the spending cuts of $1.2 trillion. The bill also increases the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.\n\nThroughout the process, Republican leaders had an ace in the hole to corral the votes even as the competing demands of rival factions appeared irreconcilable: They knew their members wouldn’t ultimately say no to Trump, from the most conservative to the least ideological and politically vulnerable.\n\n“Republicans in Congress have succeeded in our mission to enact President Trump’s America First agenda,” Johnson said in joint statement with his leadership team. “And importantly, we did it in record time, so that the effects of this nation-shaping legislation can be felt by the American people as soon as possible.”\n\nRepublicans often turned to Trump throughout the process to help close the deal on key votes. He regularly held meetings with and made phone calls to key lawmakers while issuing the occasional threat onTruth Socialto holdouts who stood in the bill’s way. Vice President JD Vance was also a regular presence in Senate and House meetings about the bill.\n\n“If President Trump and Vice President Vance had not engaged at the time they did, it wouldn’t have passed,” said conservative Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who attended White House meetings in the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room on Wednesday and ultimately voted for the bill.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the wee hours of the morning, Johnson said Trump had been making phone calls to recalcitrant holdouts as late as 1 a.m. Thursday to help break an impasse on the floor.\n\n“He doesn’t really sleep a lot,” said Johnson, who also dangled the prospect of future bills to address concerns and demands from a variety of members.\n\nIn his 1 a.m. call with holdouts, Trump and other White House officials promised to aggressively implement key provisions in the bill — from clean energy tax credit phaseouts to new Medicaid restrictions, a source familiar with the call said.\n\nOne by one, the GOP critics folded and accepted demands they insisted they wouldn’t. Conservatives swallowed a bill that adds trillions to the debt. Politically vulnerable Republicans endorsed steep cuts to Medicaid and health care spending that the CBO projects will cost 11.8 million people their insurance. Republicans whose districts and states benefit from clean energy incentives ended up voting to strip them away.\n\n“They’re just afraid of Trump and the backlash that would ensue if he called them out,” Massie, who opposed the bill, told NBC News the day before the final vote. “I’m not concerned.”\n\nTrump told reporters Thursday that it was \"easy\" to get skeptical Republicans on board during his conversations and said he didn't offer any lawmakers specific commitments or promises.\n\n\"I did not have much of a problem with any of them,\" he said. \"No deals. What I did is we talked about how good the bill is.\"\n\nRep. David Valadao, R-Calif., led a June 24 letter from 16 Republicans vowing to oppose the Senate bill because of its Medicaid cuts, which were more aggressive than those in an earlier bill. They warned that the bill would impose “penalties” for states with larger programs, “cuts to emergency Medicaid funding” and “additional burdens on hospitals already stretched thin.”\n\n“Protecting Medicaid is essential for the vulnerable constituents we were elected to represent. Therefore, we cannot support a final bill that threatens access to coverage or jeopardizes the stability of our hospitals and providers,” they wrote.\n\nThe following week, all 16 of them voted for the bill anyway. Valadao’s office didn’t reply to requests for comment.\n\nTrump and his allies sought to strike fear in GOP lawmakers by vowing to support a primary challenger to Massie in his next election. Massie, who objected to the large deficit increase in the bill, said Trump’s real goal was to keep other Republicans in line by sending a message that defying him comes with political pain.\n\n“They’re whipping this horse, because I’m out of the barn, to keep the other horses in the barn,” he said.\n\nFitzpatrick, who represents a swing district, said the steeper Medicaid cuts, “in addition to several other Senate provisions,” moved him from supporting an earlier version of the bill to opposing the final one.\n\n“I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community,” he said in a statement. “It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.”\n\nLater, on the 1 a.m. call with Trump, Massie remarked that it would be nice if Trump stopped attacking him, the source said, then flipped from no to yes on the key procedural vote.\n\nTrump said Thursday that he was \"disappointed\" that Fitzpatrick voted against the bill but stopped short of backing a primary challenge against him.\n\nThe House took up the bill after the Senatevoted 51-50 to pass iton Tuesday, with Vance breaking the tie. The only Republicans who voted against it were Rand Paul of Kentucky, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine. The party used the filibuster-proof “budget reconciliation” process to get around the 60-vote threshold, which meant some non-budgetary provisions were stripped out.\n\nEvery Democrat in both chambers voted against the bill, blasting it as a tax cut for the wealthy that is paid for by cutting programs that benefit the working class, like Medicaid. They plan to place a heavy focus on the bill in their message to voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, emboldened bypolls showing that the legislation is unpopular.\n\nAt the start of arecord-breaking floor speechThursday morning that lasted for 8 hours and 44 minutes, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., ripped what he called the “big, ugly bill, this disgusting abomination,” and accused Republicans of working through the night to pass it because it would kick millions of people off Medicaid and food stamps. Republicans argued that work requirements would target waste, fraud and abuse in those programs.\n\n“Why did debate begin at 3:28 a.m. in the morning?” Jeffries asked with House Democrats filling the seats behind him. “Republicans are once again, which has been the case, Mr. Speaker, through every step of this journey, trying to jam this bill through the House of Representatives under cover of darkness.”\n\nTrump decried Democratic opposition in his remarks in Iowa, bluntly telling supporters that he \"hates\" Democrats.\n\n“They wouldn’t vote only because they hate Trump, but I hate them, too, you know?” he said. “I really do. I hate them. I cannot stand them, because I really believe they hate our country.”\n\nRepublicans began making plans for their reconciliation package even before last year’s presidential election. In March 2024, House Republicans huddled at their annual retreat, at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, to brainstorm what should be in the bill so they'd bebetter prepared than in 2017.\n\nBut after Republicans took unified control of the White House and Congress in January, fissures in the party quickly began to emerge. Senate leaders pushed to carry out Trump’s agenda intwo separate bills, before he endorsed the House approach of passing his agenda in “one big, beautiful bill,” which eventually became the title of the legislation.\n\nAlong the way, all 53 Senate Republicans voted to set a novel precedent by using a budget trick known as “current policy baseline,” which treats $3.8 trillion in Trump tax cut extensions as costing $0, to avoid satisfying Senate rules requiring that they be paid for. Democrats said it was akin to the “nuclear option” and that it will weaken the 60-vote threshold going forward.\n\nStill, Democrats did get in a jab at Trump in the process: They deleted the title, “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” by successfully arguing that the name wasn’t budgetary in nature. The legislation’s official title is, instead, “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14.”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_text":"LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — Officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department will not be going on strike after a planned increase in Nevada’s retirement contribution rate, union leadership told 8 News Now.\n\nLast November, the board overseeing the state-run Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) program voted to increase the amount of pay that state employees, as well as police and fire department employees, must contribute.\n\nThe board increased the rate for police and fire members to 58.75% from 50%. Metro police employs more than 4,000 sworn officers.\n\nIn June, the Las Vegas Police Protective Association (LVPPA) union leadership emailed members explaining that beginning with the second check in July, pay would decrease by 4.375 percent.\n\n“We are expected to receive a 2.6% [cost-of-living increase] on July 1,”the email the 8 News Now Investigators obtained read. “The net reduction in your rate of pay will be 1.9%.”\n\nThat email included a poll with four options: to either commence a strike, utilize sick leave, report for duty but refuse to leave the briefing room, or do nothing.\n\nOn Thursday, July 3, one day before the strike would have started, LVPPA President Steve Grammas confirmed to 8 News Now that Metro officers will not be going on strike.\n\nNevada law states public employees, such as officers, cannot strike against their government employer, which Mayor Shelley Berkley cited whenasked to address the potential of a strike during her press conference.\n\n“Right now, they are in the middle of a contract that they knew about and signed,” the mayor said. “We’re all paying our fair share.”\n\n“If it was up to me, of course we’d be absorbing the difference. But the reality is that our PERS contribution went up $9 million. The city doesn’t have $9 million,” Berkley said. “We cannot carve out the police.”\n\nMayor Berkley added that Metro police’s contract is up next year, and can be renegotiated.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Opinion: Sen. Murkowski should not prioritize home state over national well-being",
    "News_text":"Senators represent individual states. But their power affects all Americans. Senator Lisa Murkowski scored a sweet deal for Alaska but dealt a heavy blow to average Americans by voting yes on Trump’s megabill. Her decision — and her explanation for that decision — reveals a profoundly misguided philosophy of governance that prioritizes perks for home-state constituents over the well-being of the nation’s most vulnerable.\n\nOver the weekend, Republican leadership in the Senate rushed to pass Trump’s sweeping domestic bill, hoping to meet the president’s arbitrary deadline of July 4. To do so, Republicans could only afford to lose three votes within their own party.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a longtime deficit hawk, opposed the bill on the grounds that it would add to the national debt. Senator Thom Tillis blasted the bill’s cuts to Medicaid, vowing to vote no. A handful of other Republican senators posed brief opposition, including Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who also criticized Medicaid cuts.\n\nBut Hawley, notorious for briefly feigning a spine before eventually getting in line with Trump and the party, stayed true to that pattern. In the end, hope rested in the hands of two familiar Republican holdouts: Susan Collins of Maine and Murkowski.\n\nCollins voted no. Murkowski caved.\n\nThe Alaska senator was at the center of weekend negotiations as Republicans underwent the tedious process of carefully sidestepping a potential filibuster while adding provisions to the bill that benefit Alaskans. The provisions included carve-outs for Alaska in Medicaid and SNAP funding cuts, ameasureaimed at helping Alaskan whaling captains, and a newtax exemptionto fishers from villages in western Alaska.\n\nThese maneuvers worked. Murkowski ultimately backed the bill on Tuesday,saying, “I had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first. We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination. My hope is that the House is going to look at this and recognize that we’re not there yet.”\n\nRunning home to Alaska with a handful of provisional scraps after relinquishing further negotiating power to a chamber full of Trump’s dutiful disciples is a far cry from responsible leadership. Murkowskisaidshe “struggled mightily” with the decision, calling the process “agonizing.” If the bill passes the House, the outcome will surely be more agonizing for low-income families who will struggle mightily after losing access to healthcare and needed child food credits.\n\nIt is incumbent upon Murkowski to explain what aspect of the bill was so beautiful in her eyes that it justified potentially stripping millions of healthcare and food assistance — a fact she never disputed but simply chose to overlook.\n\n“Do I like this bill? No,” Murkowski told NBC News after voting for it. “I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests, but I know that in many parts of the country there are Americans that are not going to be advantaged by this bill.”\n\nTo hide behind the excuse that a representative’s primary duty is to advance the financial interests of their own constituents is beneath the office of a U.S. senator. Federal delegates often seek funding and carve-outs that benefit their home states, usually attaching such benefits to larger legislation. These efforts, though overly common, are not inherently wrong. But the well-being of Americans across the country should never be traded for a collection of statewide savings or profits.\n\nMurkowski made the right choice in 2017 when she joined Susan Collins and John McCain to successfully blockade their Republican colleagues from repealing the Affordable Care Act, a move that would have left millions without insurance. The defiant trio took heat, especially McCain. Murkowski latersaid, “That was a tough vote. But I will tell you it was comforting to have some solidarity with a friend, John McCain.”\n\nIn astatementafter McCain’s death, Murkowski wrote, “John McCain embraced what it was to serve not only his country, but all those in America.” Murkowski would do well to remember that she has been vested with the same charge: to serve all Americans, with or without her friend — the gentleman from Arizona — to do it with her.\n\nTrump’s big, beautiful bill gives tax breaks to America’s wealthiest individuals while blocking access to healthcare and food for America’s most vulnerable citizens. Most recent census data shows that America’s child poverty rate is rising to nearly14%. This bill does not help American kids in need. It only hurts them. This is true even in wealthy states like Utah, where17.8%of kids (over200,000 overall) receive healthcare through Medicaid.\n\nIn voting yes, Murkowski delivered a dessert bar to America’s billionaire class just to take home some tootsie rolls to Alaska. If the House — to which Murkowski prematurely handed the baton — fails to strike or significantly overhaul the bill, America’s expanding class of impoverished children will suffer. That’s a high price for some Alaska-friendly tax credits.\n\nMurkowski made her choice in the name of a good-old-fashioned representative government, forgetting her duty to serve all Americans.",

    "News_text":"At 6:28 p.m. on Thursday, the National Weather Service released an updated severe thunderstorm warning in effect until 7:15 p.m. for Hampden and Worcester counties.\n\nWind gusts of up to 60 mph and quarter-sized hail (1 inch) are anticipated.\n\n\"At 6:28 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located over Eastford, or 12 miles northeast of Mansfield, moving east at 35 mph,\" says the weather service. \"Hail damage to vehicles is expected. Expect wind damage to trees and power lines.\"\n\nLocations impacted by the warning include Johnston, Mansfield, Windham, Plainfield, Smithfield, Killingly, Webster, Southbridge, Burrillville, Uxbridge, North Smithfield, Dudley, Scituate, Glocester, Putnam, Thompson, Sturbridge, Douglas, Brooklyn and Woodstock.\n\nThe weather service comments, \"For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a building.\"\n\nEach year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.\n\nTo ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, consider the following recommendations:\n\nLightning safety plan:\n\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.\n\nStay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's a clear indication of nearby lightning.\n\nSeek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors.\n\nIndoors safety measures:\n\nOnce you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors.\n\nThese precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways.\n\nWait for the all-clear:\n\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n\nIt's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.\n\nWhen indoor shelter isn't available:\n\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.\n\nSteer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n\nIf you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n\nCamping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning.\n\nDo not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\n\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\n\nRain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\n\nBeware of rapid water flow:\n\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\n\nMaintain safe driving distances:\n\nAdhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.\n\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\n\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\n\nChoose your lane wisely:\n\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\n\nPrioritize visibility\n\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\n\nWatch out for slippery roads:\n\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\n\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\n\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\n\nMind your windshield wipers:\n\nHeavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas.\n\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\n\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road.

    "News_text":"One of Iran's most prominent human rights advocates is warning that the Iranian government is using the aftermath of its 12-daywar with Israelto escalate repression against its own citizens -- particularly political and civil activists.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, in a video message to ABC News, warned that asurge in executionsand widespread arrests since the war began shows that the regime is using the moment to deflect from decades of alleged repression and failed policy, with the aim to \"spread fear and terror.\"\n\n\"We are now witnessing the intensification of the war between the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran -- a war that's been going on for 46 years,\" Mohammadi said.\n\nMORE: Iran crackdown deepens with speedy executions and arrests\n\nWhile Iranian authorities have publicly celebrated what they call a \"victory\" over Israel, Mohammadi rejects that claim.\n\n\"I simply don't believe this,\" she said. \"War weakens the very tools needed to achieve human rights and democracy -- like civil society. I believe that with the Islamic Republic still in power after this war, our work and our fight have now become even more difficult.\"\n\nShe warned that the regime, \"now weakened,\" has tightened its grip on civil liberties, turning on alleged traitors from within.\n\nIranian authorities, while acknowledging damage to parts of their nuclear facilities and infrastructure, insist they remain strong and unified. State-affiliated media have framed the recent wave of arrests and executions as necessary measures to protect national security, alleging infiltration and espionage linked to Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.\n\nMohammadi spoke from her home in Tehran, where she is defying a government order to return to Iran's notorious Evin Prison following urgent, life-saving surgery. Mohammadi, who is serving a 13-year, 9-month sentence, was granted a medical furlough from the prison, where many of the country's dissidents and political prisoners are held.\n\nShe and other activists have expressed particular concern over the condition and fate of Evin's prisoners following Israel'sJune 23 missile strikeon the facility. According to Iran's judiciary spokesperson, at least 71 people were killed in the strike, which the United Nations Human Rights Office condemned as a \"gross violation\" of international law. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel hit \"regime targets and agencies of government repression\" across Tehran, including Evin.\n\nWhile Mohammadi also condemned the strike, she warned that what has followed may pose an even greater human rights threat.\n\nMohammadi, who was on furlough at the time of the attack, told ABC News she has spoken extensively with prisoners and their families.\n\n\"After the attack, the situation inside Evin became extremely securitized,\" said Mohammadi, who all told has been handed more than 36 years of prison time on multiple charges including committing “propaganda activity against the state” and “collusion against state security\" -- vaguely defined national security offenses commonly used by authorities to criminalize peaceful dissent.\n\n\"Prisoner transfers are now happening under heavily militarized conditions.\" Mohammadi said, \"with full sniper coverage [and prisoners] shackled with both handcuffs and leg irons.\"\n\nFollowing days of uncertainty, Iran's Prisons Organization announced that detainees had been transferred to other prisons across Tehran Province. State media reported that many were moved to facilities including Qarchak Prison and Greater Tehran Prison.\n\n\"The situation inside both prisons is extremely worrying,\" Mohammadi said, describing the transferred inmates as \"war-affected detainees\" now subjected to what she called \"severe repression.\"\n\nA source close to the families of several political prisoners, who asked that their name not be used due to fear of reprisals, told ABC News that conditions in Qarchak Prison are \"unbearable\" and \"akin to torture,\" citing overcrowding, a lack of food and drinking water, poor sanitation, and insufficient access to basic necessities.\n\nThree political prisoners -- Golrokh Iraee, Reyhaneh Ansari and Varisheh Moradi -- issued a joint statement from Qarchak Prison, saying, \"We do not consider today's suffering of our own to be greater than the suffering imposed on the people of Iran.\"\n\nMohammadi told ABC News that she is calling for renewed international scrutiny of Iran's treatment of its own citizens.\n\nMORE: 71 killed in Israeli attack on Iran prison, official says\n\n\"I believe our situation has become even more dangerous for the people than it was before the war, and we must expand our human rights activities,\" she said. \"I hope international human rights organizations will refocus their special and particular attention on the repressions now being carried out in Iran after the war -- including the issue of arrests, prisons, torture, forced confessions, and then the executions.\"\n\nMohammadi also warned that based on \"clear evidence and reports,\" she expects that the government's crackdown on civil society, particularly young people and activists, is likely to \"become even more severe\" in the coming days.\n\nDespite the regime's efforts to silence dissent, Mohammadi said she remains committed to her activism, even as pressure mounts on her, her family, and friends.

    "News_text":"Jul. 3—Organizers can soon begin canvassing on a proposed constitutional amendment to guarantee same-sex marriage rights in the Ohio Constitution, the state attorney general says.\n\nThe proposal, titled the \"Ohio Equal Rights Amendment,\" would amend the state's constitution to expressly forbid the state from abridging someone's rights under the law \"on account of race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status.\"\n\nThe proposed amendment would strike out the portion of Ohio's constitution forbidding gay marriage, which says: \"Only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions.\"\n\nThe amendment, if it makes it onto a statewide ballot and is approved by a simple majority of voters, would replace that text with a mandate that the state \"shall recognize and treat equally all marriages regardless of race, sex, or gender identity.\"\n\nThe amendment would, however, give individual clergy the option to refuse to \"solemnize\" marriages of their choosing.\n\nOhio has recognized same-sex marriages since the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in Obergefell v.

    "News_title":"Strikes kill 94 Palestinians in Gaza, including 45 people waiting for aid, authorities say",
    "News_text":"Israeli airstrikes and shootings killed 94 Palestinians in Gaza late Wednesday and Thursday, including 45 who were attempting to get much-needed humanitarian aid, hospitals and the Health Ministry said Thursday.\n\nFamilies wept over the bodies from a strike that hit a tent camp during the night as displaced people slept in southern Gaza. At least 13 members of a single family were killed, including at least six children under 12.\n\n“My children, my children … my beloved,” wailed Intisar Abu Assi, sobbing over the bodies of her son and daughters and their young children. Another woman kissed the forehead of a dead little girl wrapped in a blanket on the floor of the morgue at Nasser Hospital in the city of Khan Younis.\n\nIn central Gaza, a boy stroked the face of his dead sister, 6-year-old Heba Abu Etiwi, in a morgue at Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital. The girl and another of her brothers were among eight people killed when a strike Wednesday evening hit near a stand selling falafel.\n\nA separate strike on a school in Gaza City sheltering displaced people also killed 15 people.\n\nThe toll from strikes emerged as more Palestinians were killed in near-daily shootings while trying to obtain aid.\n\nFive were killed on the roads leading to food-distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strip’s population. Another 40 were killed while waiting for trucks carrying U.N. aid in several locations around Gaza, according to hospital officials.\n\nWitnesses have said Israeli troops regularly unleash barrages on crowds of Palestinians trying to reach the GHF sites. Witnesses have also reported troops opening fire when crowds of people mass near military-run zones of Gaza, waiting for U.N. trucks to enter.\n\nMore than 500 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded since the food-distribution sites opened in May.\n\nThe Israeli military, whose forces are deployed on the roads leading to the sites, says it fires warning shots to control crowds or at Palestinians who approach its troops. Armed U.S. contractors guard the sites.\n\nAmnesty International on Thursday issued a report saying Israel was continuing to “use starvation of civilians as a weapon of war … as part of its ongoing genocide.”\n\nIt said the GHF distribution system appeared intended only to “placate international concerns” even as Israel allows in only a small amount of food for the U.N. to distribute separately.\n\n“By maintaining a deadly, dehumanizing and ineffective militarized ‘aid’ scheme, Israeli authorities have turned aid-seeking into a booby trap for desperate starved Palestinians,” it said.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry denounced the Amnesty report, saying the organization has “joined forces with Hamas and fully adopted all of its propaganda lies.”\n\nIsrael has rejected allegations it is committing genocide in Gaza in the war with Hamas, and it is challenging the accusation filed by South Africa at the International Court of Justice.\n\nAmnesty accused Israel last year of committing genocide, saying it has sought to deliberately destroy Palestinians by mounting deadly attacks, demolishing vital infrastructure and preventing the delivery of food, medicine and other aid.\n\nIsrael intends for GHF to replace the U.N. humanitarian network, which has delivered massive amounts of aid to Palestinians throughout the war. Israel contends that Hamas siphons off large amounts of aid from that system, a claim that the U.N. and aid groups deny. They have rejected GHF, saying it cannot deliver enough aid, endangers Palestinians and is being used by Israel to carry out its war goals.\n\nIsrael cut off all food and other supplies to Gaza for more 2 ½ months this year, driving its population toward famine, in what it said was a move to push Hamas to make concessions in negotiations and release hostages.\n\nIt eased the blockade in March. The Foreign Ministry and COGAT, the Israeli defense body in charge of coordinating aid to Gaza, said Wednesday that Israel has facilitated the entry of over 3,000 aid trucks into the Gaza Strip since May 19.\n\nThat amounts to around 28 trucks a day, a fraction of the hundreds of trucks a day aid workers say are needed.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, GHF rejected criticism of its operations and said it has delivered the equivalent of more than 52 million meals. GHF distributes boxes of food staples such as lentils and rice, saying one box holds the equivalent of more than 50 meals.\n\nWitnesses have reported scenes of chaos at GHF sites as desperate crowds race to pick up food boxes, with some taking more than one while many others go empty-handed. Much of the food is sold in markets at astronomical prices.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza has passed 57,000 since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its death count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.\n\nThe deaths come as Israel and Hamas inch closer to a possible ceasefire that would end the 21-month war.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that Israel had agreed on terms for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen. Hamas’ response emphasized its demand that the truce lead to an end to the war.\n\nThe Israeli military blames Hamas for the civilian casualties because it operates from populated areas. The military said it targeted Hamas militants and rocket launchers in northern Gaza that fired toward Israel on Wednesday.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages.\n\nThe war has left the coastal Palestinian territory in ruins, with much of the urban landscape flattened in the fighting. More than 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million population has been displaced, often multiple times.\n\nDownload theFREE WPXI News appfor breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Channel 11 News onFacebookandTwitter. |Watch WPXI NOW",

(WGN) – One of Chicagoland’s biggest Fourth of July parades is held in Evanston, and it’s a competition to get the best view every year.\n\nThe parade actually begins on July 1. It’s one of the most important days on Bob Stanton’s calendar.\n\n“Basically what we want to try and do is get up to Central Street and put the chairs out by six o’clock,” Stanton said.\n\nStanding on his front step, you could say he’s also on the edge of his seat. Each year, he’s the first to set up his chairs for the city’s beloved parade.\n\nAs the sun rises, he loads his chairs into his Jeep and sets out for Central Street, North Evanston’s main drag.\n\nFourth of July forecast map: Will Chicagoland have clear skies for fireworks?\n\n“People would put their chairs out earlier and earlier during the day, and eventually it goes to the point where people were putting their chairs out on July 3, July 2, July 1, and then people were putting them out a week before the parade,” Stanton said.\n\nBy city ordinance, no one is allowed to place chairs along the parade route until 6 a.m. on July 1.\n\n“I didn’t realize it was now that you could put the chairs out, so I’m lucky I came over here. It looks like there’s quite a crowd forming at 5:50 in the morning,” Joe Brady said.\n\nMeanwhile, Stanton was patiently waiting for the clock to strike six.\n\nThe race to reserve a space is as much a tradition in the North Shore suburb as the 102-year-old parade itself.\n\n“I think it’s nuts, but it’s been going on forever. I’ve lived down the street for 20 years. People used to start June 1,” Jenny Kamm said.\n\nFireworks and furry friends: How to keep pets calm and safe this July 4\n\nPeople bring tape, tarps, rope and ribbon to claim a spot along the parade route.\n\n“It’s definitely an Evanston tradition,” Brady said.\n\nCentral Street in Evanston might as well be Main Street America, lined with lawn chairs.\n\n“It’s kind of like a small-town tradition in a very big city,” Aimee Sriver said.\n\nSome lock their chairs, but most simply leave them.\n\n“I used to tie them with rope down and everything. Now I just kind of leave them out there. It’s kind of the honor system,” Eli Rogers said.\n\nStanton is sort of Evanston’s “Mr. Fourth of July.” He’s attended the parade every year for almost half a century, always in the same spot.\n\n“We’ve been coming for 45 years…this is a prime spot. The Jesse White Tumblers, right here in front of us,” Stanton said. “That’s why we get here at six, only because we want to get this spot.”\n\nFourth of July fireworks may trigger PTSD in veterans. Tips on how to cope\n\nFor Stanton, the number of chairs doesn’t matter. Evanston’s parade take a back seat to no one.\n\n“I think it’s one of the best parades in the country,” Stanton said.\n\nEvanston has a full day of activities planned.\n\nThe parade steps off from the corner of Central Street and Central Park Avenue at 2 p.m., followed by a 7:30 p.m. concert at Dawes Park and then lakefront fireworks at 9:30 p.m.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Abortions can resume in Kansas City after Missouri ruling, Planned Parenthood says",
    "News_text":"Abortion services are poised to resume in Kansas City and across Missouri after a Jackson County judge on Thursday blocked a series of restrictions thattemporarily banned access.\n\nJackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang, inan order issued late Thursday afternoon, halted requirements that abortion providers must obtain state licenses, among other restrictions. The licenses included rules that providers called unethical, including mandatory pelvic exams for women.\n\nThe order marks a key moment for abortion rights supporters, effectively restoring access after a procedural ruling from the Missouri Supreme Courttemporarily banned the procedurein late May.\n\nPlanned Parenthood’s clinic in Kansas City immediately planned to restore access on Monday, the organization confirmed to The Star.\n\n“Abortion is legal again in Missouri because voters demanded it and we fought for it,” Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. “Care starts again on Monday in Kansas City. We’re not stopping until every Missourian can get the care they need, close to home.”\n\nThursday’s ruling came roughly a month after the state Supreme Court ordered Zhang to vacate two preliminary injunctions that had allowed abortions to resume in the state. The Supreme Court order temporarily halted all abortions in what providers called a “de facto ban.”\n\nThe court had ordered Zhang to reevaluate her rulings based on a different legal standard. After a series of legal fights between abortion providers and attorneys for the state of Missouri, Zhang’s order on Thursday blocked the same restrictions and effectively restored access.\n\nZhang’s order on Thursday was mixed and did not block all restrictions sought by abortion providers, including a ban on medication abortions. But the ruling halted enough of the regulations for Planned Parenthood to begin offering procedural abortions again.\n\nThe order states the regulations should be blocked after voters in November approved an abortion rights amendment, called Amendment 3, that enshrined reproductive rights in the state constitution.\n\nThe restrictions, often called TRAP laws or Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers, included a 72-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion and clinic licensing rules. The regulations effectively caused the number of abortions in Missouri to drop from 6,163 in 2010 to 150 in 2021 before the state’s former ban was enacted in 2022.\n\nAbortion rights supporters quickly celebrated the ruling as a victory in the fight for restored access.\n\n“Missourians voted to end the abortion ban and establish the right to reproductive freedom in the constitution, and today, a Missouri court once again ruled to uphold the will of the people,” said Mallory Schwarz, the executive director of Abortion Action Missouri.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican who fought against restored access, said in a statement that would he would immediately appeal the decision.\n\n“I will always fight to make Missouri the safest state in the nation for women and children,” Bailey said.\n\nWhile Thursday’s ruling marked a win for abortion rights supporters, it also comes as a new fight at the ballot box looms.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in May voted to put a new abortion ban on the 2026 statewide ballot. If approved by voters, the proposed constitutional amendment, which will also be called Amendment 3, would strike down the November vote that legalized access and ban nearly all abortions in the state.\n\nSchwarz nodded at the upcoming ballot fight in a statement on Thursday, saying, “attacking Missourians’ freedom will always be a losing strategy.”\n\n“We will defeat abortion bans as many times as we have to, and we know that the majority of Missourians are with us,” Schwarz said.",

    "News_title":"Despite HR’s from White & Bleis, Drive fall to Tourists 3-2",
    "News_text":"GREENVILLE, S.C. (Greenville Drive) –The Greenville Drive fell just short on Wednesday night at Fluor Field, dropping a narrow 3-2 contest to the Asheville Tourists in front of a lively holiday-weekend crowd of 6,551.\n\nIn a game that showcased stellar pitching, timely power, and aggressive base running, it was Walker Janek’s eighth-inning solo homer — his fifth of the season — that ultimately stood as the difference for Asheville (35-42), denying the Drive (39-38) a chance to build momentum before the Fourth of July.\n\nGreenville starter Brandon Clarke was sharp through 2.2 scoreless innings, scattering just one hit while striking out four. The right-hander gave way to Shea Sprague in the third after hitting Janek with a pitch and allowing a walk to Drew Vogel.\n\nSprague escaped that jam but ran into trouble an inning later. Asheville broke the scoreless tie in the fourth when Will Bush drew a leadoff walk and scored on Kenni Gomez’s RBI single. An errant throw by first baseman Albert Feliz allowed Chase Jaworsky, who had reached on a bunt single, to move up and later score on Reylin Perez’s groundout, putting the Tourists up 2-0 in the top of the fourth.\n\nHudson White put Greenville on the board in the bottom of the fifth, launching a solo home run off Asheville starter Juan Bello to cut the deficit to 2-1. It was White’s fourth homer of the season and one of the Drive’s few breakthroughs against Bello’s sharp mix of fastballs and off-speed offerings. The right-hander struck out eight over five innings, yielding just four hits.\n\nGreenville threatened again in the sixth after Miguel Bleis doubled off reliever Jose Guedez and swiped third base — his 18th stolen bag — but the middle of the order came up empty as Johanfran Garcia, Antonio Anderson, and Freili Encarnacion all struck out to strand Bleis and a walked Nelly Taylor in scoring position.\n\nBleis wouldn’t be denied later. After Janek’s critical blast in the top of the eighth padded Asheville’s lead to 3-1, Bleis led off the bottom half by pulling a solo shot just inside the left-field foul pole for his 11th homer. Taylor walked again, stole third after moving up on a groundout — one of his three stolen bases on the night — but the Drive again failed to bring him home.\n\nAggressive baserunning was Asheville’s edge all evening. The Tourists swiped eight bases — including two apiece from Joseph Sullivan, Drew Vogel, Kenni Gomez, and Janek. Gomez added a key outfield assist, gunning down Garcia at second in the fourth. Despite getting picked off once, the Tourists’ relentless pressure forced Drive pitchers to work with runners in motion all game long.\n\nGreenville’s staff — Clarke, Sprague, and Cooper Adams — still punched out 14 Asheville hitters and limited the Tourists to just five hits, but Janek’s late homer off Sprague proved decisive. Sprague (1-1) took the loss after allowing three runs (two earned) across 4.2 innings.\n\nGuedez earned his first save of the season with four solid innings in relief of Bello, striking out five and closing the door on the Drive’s late push. Asheville’s bullpen received a boost when right fielder Tyler Whitaker was ejected in the seventh for arguing a called third strike, but his replacement, Drew Brutcher, held his ground defensively.\n\nThe Drive left seven runners on base and went just 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Feliz reached twice but also committed two errors that aided Asheville’s early runs.\n\nGarcia collected two hits for Greenville while Bleis reached base three times, adding a double, a homer, and his stolen base. But with Anderson and Encarnacion combining to strike out five times and Greenville’s lineup whiffing 13 times in total, the clutch hit proved elusive.\n\nThe Drive will wrap up their holiday series against Asheville with 3 games in North Carolina beginning on Independence Day and concluding Sunday, July 6. First pitch is set for 6:35 p.m. as Greenville looks to bounce back and reclaim momentum heading into the second half of the series north of the border.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Abortion services are poised to resume in Kansas City and across Missouri after a Jackson County judge on Thursday blocked a series of restrictions thattemporarily banned access.\n\nJackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang, inan order issued late Thursday afternoon, halted requirements that abortion providers must obtain state licenses, among other restrictions. The licenses included rules that providers called unethical, including mandatory pelvic exams for women.\n\nThe order marks a key moment for abortion rights supporters, effectively restoring access after a procedural ruling from the Missouri Supreme Courttemporarily banned the procedurein late May.\n\nPlanned Parenthood’s clinic in Kansas City immediately planned to restore access on Monday, the organization confirmed to The Star.\n\n“Abortion is legal again in Missouri because voters demanded it and we fought for it,” Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. “Care starts again on Monday in Kansas City. We’re not stopping until every Missourian can get the care they need, close to home.”\n\nThursday’s ruling came roughly a month after the state Supreme Court ordered Zhang to vacate two preliminary injunctions that had allowed abortions to resume in the state. The Supreme Court order temporarily halted all abortions in what providers called a “de facto ban.”\n\nThe court had ordered Zhang to reevaluate her rulings based on a different legal standard. After a series of legal fights between abortion providers and attorneys for the state of Missouri, Zhang’s order on Thursday blocked the same restrictions and effectively restored access.\n\nZhang’s order on Thursday was mixed and did not block all restrictions sought by abortion providers, including a ban on medication abortions. But the ruling halted enough of the regulations for Planned Parenthood to begin offering procedural abortions again.\n\nThe order states the regulations should be blocked after voters in November approved an abortion rights amendment, called Amendment 3, that enshrined reproductive rights in the state constitution.\n\nThe restrictions, often called TRAP laws or Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers, included a 72-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion and clinic licensing rules. The regulations effectively caused the number of abortions in Missouri to drop from 6,163 in 2010 to 150 in 2021 before the state’s former ban was enacted in 2022.\n\nAbortion rights supporters quickly celebrated the ruling as a victory in the fight for restored access.\n\n“Missourians voted to end the abortion ban and establish the right to reproductive freedom in the constitution, and today, a Missouri court once again ruled to uphold the will of the people,” said Mallory Schwarz, the executive director of Abortion Action Missouri.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican who fought against restored access, said in a statement that would he would immediately appeal the decision.\n\n“I will always fight to make Missouri the safest state in the nation for women and children,” Bailey said.\n\nWhile Thursday’s ruling marked a win for abortion rights supporters, it also comes as a new fight at the ballot box looms.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in May voted to put a new abortion ban on the 2026 statewide ballot. If approved by voters, the proposed constitutional amendment, which will also be called Amendment 3, would strike down the November vote that legalized access and ban nearly all abortions in the state.\n\nSchwarz nodded at the upcoming ballot fight in a statement on Thursday, saying, “attacking Missourians’ freedom will always be a losing strategy.”\n\n“We will defeat abortion bans as many times as we have to, and we know that the majority of Missourians are with us,” Schwarz said.",

    "News_title":"Under pressure, Hezbollah weighs scaling back its arsenal",
    "News_text":"BEIRUT (Reuters) -Hezbollah has begun a major strategic review in the wake of its devastating war with Israel, including considering scaling back its role as an armed movement without disarming completely, three sources familiar with the deliberations say.\n\nThe internal discussions, which aren't yet finalised and haven't previously been reported, reflect the formidable pressures the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group has faced since a truce was reached in late November.\n\nIsraeli forces continue to strike areas where the group holds sway, accusing Hezbollah of ceasefire violations, which it denies. It is also grappling with acute financial strains, U.S. demands for its disarmament and diminished political clout since a new cabinet took office in February with U.S. support.\n\nThe group's difficulties have been compounded by seismic shifts in the regional power balance since Israel decimated its command, killed thousands of its fighters and destroyed much of its arsenal last year.\n\nHezbollah's Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled in December, severing a key arms supply line from Iran. Tehran is now emerging from its own bruising war with Israel, raising doubts over how much aid it can offer, a regional security source and a senior Lebanese official told Reuters.\n\nAnother senior official, who is familiar with Hezbollah's internal deliberations, said the group had been holding clandestine discussions on its next steps. Small committees have been meeting in person or remotely to discuss issues including its leadership structure, political role, social and development work, and weapons, the official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official and two other sources familiar with the discussions indicated Hezbollah has concluded that the arsenal it had amassed to deter Israel from attacking Lebanon had become a liability.\n\nHezollah \"had an excess of power,\" the official said. \"All that strength turned into a weak point.\"\n\nUnder the leadership of Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed last year, Hezbollah grew into a regional military player with tens of thousands of fighters, rockets and drones poised to strike Israel. It also provided support to allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.\n\nIsrael came to regard Hezbollah as a significant threat. When the group opened fire in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas at the start of the Gaza war in 2023, Israel responded with airstrikes in Lebanon that escalated into a ground offensive.\n\nHezbollah has since relinquished a number of weapons depots in southern Lebanon to the Lebanese armed forces as stipulated in last year's truce, though Israel says it has struck military infrastructure there still linked to the group.\n\nHezbollah is now considering turning over some weapons it has elsewhere in the country - notably missiles and drones seen as the biggest threat to Israel - on condition Israel withdraws from the south and halts its attacks, the sources said.\n\nBut the group won't surrender its entire arsenal, the sources said. For example, it intends to keep lighter arms and anti-tank missiles, they said, describing them as a means to resist any future attacks.\n\nHezbollah's media office did not respond to questions for this article.\n\nIsreal's military said it would continue operating along its northern border in accordance with the understandings between Israel and Lebanon, in order eliminate any threat and protect Israeli citizens. The U.S. State Department declined to comment on private diplomatic conversations, referring questions to Lebanon's government. Lebanon's presidency did not respond to questions.\n\nFor Hezbollah to preserve any military capabilities would fall short of Israeli and U.S. ambitions. Under the terms of the ceasefire brokered by the U.S. and France, Lebanon's armed forces were to confiscate \"all unauthorized arms\", beginning in the area south of the Litani River - the zone closest to Israel.\n\nLebanon's government also wants Hezbollah to surrender the rest of its weapons as it works to establish a state monopoly on arms. Failure to do so could stir tensions with the group's Lebanese rivals, which accuse Hezbollah of leveraging its military might to impose its will in state affairs and repeatedly dragging Lebanon into conflicts.\n\nAll sides have said they remain committed to the ceasefire, even as they traded accusations of violations.\n\nPART OF HEZBOLLAH'S 'DNA'\n\nArms have been central to Hezbollah's doctrine since it was founded by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to fight Israeli forces who invaded Lebanon in 1982, at the height of the 1975-1990 Lebanese civil war. Tensions over the Shi'ite Muslim group's arsenal sparked another, brief civil conflict in 2008.\n\nThe United States and Israel deem Hezbollah a terrorist group.\n\nNicholas Blanford, who wrote a history of Hezbollah, said that in order to reconstitute itself, the group would have to justify its retention of weapons in an increasingly hostile political landscape, while addressing damaging intelligence breaches and ensuring its long-term finances.\n\n\"They've faced challenges before, but not this number simultaneously,\" said Blanford, a fellow with the Atlantic Council, a U.S. think tank.\n\nA European official familiar with intelligence assessments said there was a lot of brainstorming underway within Hezbollah about its future but no clear outcomes. The official described Hezbollah's status as an armed group as part of its DNA, saying it would be difficult for it to become a purely political party.\n\nNearly a dozen sources familiar with Hezbollah's thinking said the group wants to keep some arms, not only in case of future threats from Israel, but also because it is worried that Sunni Muslim jihadists in neighbouring Syria might exploit lax security to attack eastern Lebanon, a Shi'ite-majority region.\n\nDespite the catastrophic results of the latest war with Israel - tens of thousands of people were left homeless and swathes of the south and Beirut's southern suburbs were destroyed - many of Hezbollah's core supporters want it to remain armed.\n\nUm Hussein, whose son died fighting for Hezbollah, cited the threat still posed by Israel and a history of conflict with Lebanese rivals as reasons to do so.\n\n\"Hezbollah is the backbone of the Shi'ites, even if it is weak now,\" she said, asking to be identified by a traditional nickname because members of her family still belong to Hezbollah. \"We were a weak, poor group. Nobody spoke up for us.\"\n\nHezbollah's immediate priority is tending to the needs of constituents who bore the brunt of the war, the sources familiar with its deliberations said.\n\nIn December, Secretary General Naim Qassem said Hezbollah had paid more than $50 million to affected families with more than $25 million still to hand out. But there are signs that its funds are running short.\n\nOne Beirut resident said he had paid for repairs to his apartment in the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs after it was damaged in the war only to see the entire block destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in June.\n\n\"Everyone is scattered and homeless. No one has promised to pay for our shelter,\" said the man, who declined to be identified for fear his complaints might jeopardise his chances of receiving compensation.\n\nHe said he had received cheques from Hezbollah but was told by the group's financial institution, Al-Qard Al-Hassan, that it did not have funds available to cash them. Reuters could not immediately reach the institution for comment.\n\nOther indications of financial strain have included cutbacks to free medications offered by Hezbollah-run pharmacies, three people familiar with the operations said.\n\nSQUEEZING HEZBOLLAH FINANCES\n\nHezbollah has put the onus on Lebanon's government to secure reconstruction funding. But Foreign Minister Youssef Raji, a Hezbollah critic, has said there will be no aid from foreign donors until the state establishes a monopoly on arms.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said in May that, while Washington was engaged in supporting sustainable reconstruction in Lebanon, \"this cannot happen without Hezbollah laying down their arms\".\n\nIsrael has also been squeezing Hezbollah's finances.\n\nThe Israeli military said on June 25 that it had killed an Iranian official who oversaw hundreds of millions of dollars in transfers annually to armed groups in the region, as well as a man in southern Lebanon who ran a currency exchange business that helped get some of these funds to Hezbollah.\n\nIran did not comment at the time, and its U.N. mission did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nSince February, Lebanon has barred commercial flights between Beirut and Tehran, after Israel's military accused Hezbollah of using civilian aircraft to bring in money from Iran and threatened to take action to stop this.\n\nLebanese authorities have also tightened security at Beirut airport, where Hezbollah had free rein for years, making it harder for the group to smuggle in funds that way, according to an official and a security source familiar with airport operations.\n\nSuch moves have fuelled anger among Hezbollah's supporters towards the administration led by President Joseph Aoun and Nawaf Salam, who was made prime minister against Hezbollah's wishes.\n\nAlongside its Shi'ite ally, the Amal Movement, Hezbollah swept local elections in May, with many seats uncontested. The group will be seeking to preserve its dominance in legislative elections next year.\n\nNabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of Lebanon's Annahar newspaper, said next year's poll was part of an \"existential battle\" for Hezbollah.\n\n\"It will use all the means it can, firstly to play for time so it doesn't have to disarm, and secondly to make political and popular gains,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Timour Azhari in Beirut and Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem; Writing by Maya Gebeily; Editing by Tom Perry and Alexandra Zavis)",

    "News_title":"Nobel laureate warns Iran is increasingly repressing its own citizens",
    "News_text":"One of Iran's most prominent human rights advocates is warning that the Iranian government is using the aftermath of its 12-daywar with Israelto escalate repression against its own citizens -- particularly political and civil activists.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, in a video message to ABC News, warned that asurge in executionsand widespread arrests since the war began shows that the regime is using the moment to deflect from decades of alleged repression and failed policy, with the aim to \"spread fear and terror.\"\n\n\"We are now witnessing the intensification of the war between the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran -- a war that's been going on for 46 years,\" Mohammadi said.\n\nMORE: Iran crackdown deepens with speedy executions and arrests\n\nWhile Iranian authorities have publicly celebrated what they call a \"victory\" over Israel, Mohammadi rejects that claim.\n\n\"I simply don't believe this,\" she said. \"War weakens the very tools needed to achieve human rights and democracy -- like civil society. I believe that with the Islamic Republic still in power after this war, our work and our fight have now become even more difficult.\"\n\nShe warned that the regime, \"now weakened,\" has tightened its grip on civil liberties, turning on alleged traitors from within.\n\nIranian authorities, while acknowledging damage to parts of their nuclear facilities and infrastructure, insist they remain strong and unified. State-affiliated media have framed the recent wave of arrests and executions as necessary measures to protect national security, alleging infiltration and espionage linked to Israel's Mossad intelligence agency.\n\nMohammadi spoke from her home in Tehran, where she is defying a government order to return to Iran's notorious Evin Prison following urgent, life-saving surgery. Mohammadi, who is serving a 13-year, 9-month sentence, was granted a medical furlough from the prison, where many of the country's dissidents and political prisoners are held.\n\nShe and other activists have expressed particular concern over the condition and fate of Evin's prisoners following Israel'sJune 23 missile strikeon the facility. According to Iran's judiciary spokesperson, at least 71 people were killed in the strike, which the United Nations Human Rights Office condemned as a \"gross violation\" of international law. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israel hit \"regime targets and agencies of government repression\" across Tehran, including Evin.\n\nWhile Mohammadi also condemned the strike, she warned that what has followed may pose an even greater human rights threat.\n\nMohammadi, who was on furlough at the time of the attack, told ABC News she has spoken extensively with prisoners and their families.\n\n\"After the attack, the situation inside Evin became extremely securitized,\" said Mohammadi, who all told has been handed more than 36 years of prison time on multiple charges including committing “propaganda activity against the state” and “collusion against state security\" -- vaguely defined national security offenses commonly used by authorities to criminalize peaceful dissent.\n\n\"Prisoner transfers are now happening under heavily militarized conditions.\" Mohammadi said, \"with full sniper coverage [and prisoners] shackled with both handcuffs and leg irons.\"\n\nFollowing days of uncertainty, Iran's Prisons Organization announced that detainees had been transferred to other prisons across Tehran Province. State media reported that many were moved to facilities including Qarchak Prison and Greater Tehran Prison.\n\n\"The situation inside both prisons is extremely worrying,\" Mohammadi said, describing the transferred inmates as \"war-affected detainees\" now subjected to what she called \"severe repression.\"\n\nA source close to the families of several political prisoners, who asked that their name not be used due to fear of reprisals, told ABC News that conditions in Qarchak Prison are \"unbearable\" and \"akin to torture,\" citing overcrowding, a lack of food and drinking water, poor sanitation, and insufficient access to basic necessities.\n\nThree political prisoners -- Golrokh Iraee, Reyhaneh Ansari and Varisheh Moradi -- issued a joint statement from Qarchak Prison, saying, \"We do not consider today's suffering of our own to be greater than the suffering imposed on the people of Iran.\"\n\nMohammadi told ABC News that she is calling for renewed international scrutiny of Iran's treatment of its own citizens.\n\nMORE: 71 killed in Israeli attack on Iran prison, official says\n\n\"I believe our situation has become even more dangerous for the people than it was before the war, and we must expand our human rights activities,\" she said. \"I hope international human rights organizations will refocus their special and particular attention on the repressions now being carried out in Iran after the war -- including the issue of arrests, prisons, torture, forced confessions, and then the executions.\"\n\nMohammadi also warned that based on \"clear evidence and reports,\" she expects that the government's crackdown on civil society, particularly young people and activists, is likely to \"become even more severe\" in the coming days.\n\nDespite the regime's efforts to silence dissent, Mohammadi said she remains committed to her activism, even as pressure mounts on her, her family, and friends. A member of her support team told ABC News that she has received repeated phone calls demanding her return to prison, and that intelligence agents have summoned, interrogated, and harassed her friends and family in what appears to be an effort to isolate her.\n\nHer team also says Iranian financial authorities issued an official order to seize Mohammadi's Nobel Peace Prize award money -- 17 billion toman or approximately USD $400,000 -- echoing a similar tactic used against fellow Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi in 2009.\n\n\"I want to see an end to the Islamic Republic -- a repressive, theocratic, and authoritarian system that is misogynistic, unreformable, and fundamentally dysfunctional,\" Mohammadi's said. \"But I am against war -- because it drains the strength and capacity of the Iranian people, civil society, and pro-democracy activists.\"\n\nStill, she remains hopeful.\n\n\"For decades, we've been fighting for freedom, democracy, and equality -- enduring repression, imprisonment, executions, and torture. But we've never backed down,\" she said. \"Until the day democracy is achieved -- I will not stop.\"",

    "News_title":"Law used to kick out Nazis could be used to strip citizenship from many more Americans",
    "News_text":"For decades, the US Department of Justice has used a tool to sniff out former Nazis who lied their way into becoming American citizens: a law that allowed the department to denaturalize, or strip, citizenship from criminals who falsified their records or hid their illicit pasts.\n\nThat power, under the new Trump administration, may be broadening.\n\nAccording to a memo issued by the Justice Department last month, attorneys should aim their denaturalization work to target a much broader swath of individuals – anyone who may “pose a potential danger to national security.”\n\nThe directive appears to be a push towards a larger denaturalization effort that fits with the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies. These could leave some of themillions of naturalized American citizensat risk of losing their status and being deported.\n\nPeople who have committed violent crimes, are members or associates of gangs and drug cartels or have committed fraud should also be prioritized, the memo, issued by the head of the DOJ’s Civil Division, said.\n\nBut for many officials and experts, the real concern, they say, is that it is designed to strike fear in the hearts of legal immigrants across the country – particularly those who are at odds with Trump himself.\n\n“The politicization of citizenship rights is something that really worries me, I think it’s just flatly inconsistent with our democratic system,” Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, told CNN.\n\nThe statute in question is part of a McCarthy-era law first established to root out Communists during the red scare.\n\nBut its most common use over the years has been against war criminals.\n\nIn 1979, the Justice Department established a unit that used the statute to deport hundreds of people who assisted the Nazis.Eli Rosenbaum, the man who led it for years, helped the department strip citizenship from or deport 100 people, and earned a reputation as the DOJ’s most prolific Nazi hunter.\n\nRosenbaum briefly returned in 2022 to lead an effort to identify and prosecute anyone who committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nBut the department has broadened those efforts beyond Nazis several times, including an Obama-era initiative calledOperation Janustargeting those who stole identities to earn citizenship.\n\nIn 2020, Trump attempted to expand denaturalization efforts by creatinga dedicated officeat the Justice Department, but it was quietly disbanded by the Biden administration the following year.\n\nOne former DOJ official called the office a “branding opportunity,” noting that it was not particularly effective and did not fit with Trump’s successor’s priorities.\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has worked to redesign how the federal government enforces immigration in the country, pushing agencies like the FBI and US Marshals to join deportation efforts and targeting foreign student visas for people abroad hoping to attend a private university in the states.\n\nInstead of reinstating the stand-alone office from his first administration, the entire Civil Division is now being told to prioritize denaturalization “in all cases permitted by law,” according to the memo, which also suggests that US attorneys’ offices across the country should flag cases where they may be able to initiate denaturalization proceedings.\n\nTrump filed 102 denaturalization cases during his first administration, contrasted with the 24 cases filed under Biden, DOJ Spokesperson Chad Gilmartinsaid on social mediaWednesday. So far, the second Trump administration has filed 5 cases in its first five months.\n\nThe DOJ told CNN in a statement: “Denaturalization proceedings will only be pursued as permitted by law and supported by evidence against individuals who illegally procured or misrepresented facts in the naturalization process.”\n\nBut current and former DOJ officials who spoke to CNN said that the beyond instructing lawyers to file as many denaturalization cases as possible, the memo is so broad that it could allow the Justice Department to invoke vague or unsubstantiated claims to expel people from the country.\n\nRobertson, of Case Western, warned that the memo could give way to the Trump administration retroactively searching for missteps in the naturalization process of perceived political opponents, like student activists.\n\nIrina Manta, a law professor at Hofstra University, said that the administration’s move could have a “chilling effect” on free speech, both political and otherwise.\n\n“I regularly observe the fear firsthand,” she said.\n\nTrump has publicly flirted with the notion of deporting American citizens he doesn’t want in the country.\n\nThough the seriousness of these statements is highly unclear, he has called for everything from deporting “bad people … many of them [who] were born in our country” to saying his administration should “take a look” at removing Elon Musk after his erstwhile ally criticized the president’s spending bill.\n\nAt least one ally has taken a more formal step.\n\nLast week, Andy Ogles, a Republican congressman,askedAttorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani—who was born in Uganda and naturalized in 2018— should be subject to denaturalization proceedings because he “publicly glorifies” people connected to Hamas in a rap song.\n\nBondi has not publicly responded to the letter.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_text":"A container is offloaded from the Wanhai 175 cargo ship at the Tan Vu Terminal, operated by Vietnam Maritime Corp., at Haiphong Port in Haiphong, Vietnam, on Jan. 15, 2025. Credit - Linh Pham—Bloomberg\/Getty Images\n\nAU.S. and Vietnam trade deal has been reached that means Vietnam will avoid the most severe tariff rates—set to go back up next week—but there’s a catch that could anger Vietnam’s largest trading partner, China.\n\nThe deal, announced Wednesday, will mean Vietnamese exports to the U.S. are tariffed at a 20% rate—lower than the initial 46% “reciprocal” tariff announced in April, but double the 10% universal tariff. Goods that are deemed to be transshipped, however, will be tariffed at a 40% rate—a policy that seems aimed at China which has used the method to get around U.S. levies. Transshipping involves transferring cargo from one vessel to another while in transit to the destination country and is often done to disguise a product’s country-of-origin in order to illegally skirt import levies.\n\nIn return, Vietnam agreed to drop all tariffs on U.S. imports, President Donald Trump said.\n\n“In other words, they will ‘OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,’ meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff,” the Presidentpostedon Truth Social on Wednesday morning.\n\nAt the heart of Trump’s deal with Vietnam—and histalks with other major trading partners—has been an effort to counter what he sees as China’s unfair trade practices. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro called Vietnam “essentially a colony of communist China” in anApril interview on Fox Newswhile describing how nontariff barriers, including Chinese transshipments, contribute to U.S. trade deficits. “Vietnam sells us $15 for every $1 that we sell them and about $5 of that is just Chinese product that comes into Vietnam, they slap a ‘Made in Vietnam’ label on it and they send it here to evade the tariffs,” he said.\n\nThe higher tier of tariffs on transshipments will impact goods that have components originating in one country, such as China, but are routed through Vietnam then exported to the U.S. China supplies much of the components and raw materials to Vietnam and other Asian countries that are then used to make finished goods, but it also ships some finished goods through Vietnam or mostly finished goods that go through a minimal final assembly in Vietnam with their county-of-origin misrepresented as Vietnam, which is considered illegal.\n\nBut restrictions on transshipments could tick off China, which is a larger trading partner for most Asian countries than the U.S.\n\nHere’s what to know about what the deal means for Vietnam and China.\n\nVietnam has been keen to be on Trump’s good side since he announced his “reciprocal” tariffs in April.\n\nVietnam was thesixth-largest importerto the U.S. last year, supplying almost $137 billion worth of goods and fuelling a$124 billion trade surpluswith the U.S.—the third largest trade gap with the U.S. after China and Mexico. The country’s share of imports to the U.S. was bolstered during Trump’s first term, when trade tensions with China pushed firms to move production to Southeast Asia.\n\nVietnamese officials have been in talks with the Trump Administration for weeks and even signed deals to purchase more American goods ahead of Thursday’s trade agreement. The country has promised to buymore aircraft, liquefied natural gas, andagricultural productsfrom the U.S. Vietnamese officials have also backed the Trump Organization’s plans for a $1.5 billion luxury resort and golf club development outside Hanoi. Vietnam’s agreement, according to Trump, to remove all levies on U.S. imports is indicative of the country’s push to maintain close trading ties with the U.S., even as Trump hasretreated from the relationshipin other areas, such as through theshuttering of USAID.\n\nTrump boasted that the zero tariffs will drive sales of American SUVs in Vietnam, although an American-made car, even with no duties, may still be more expensive than cars produced elsewhere, and it’s not clear how much domestic demand there is for American cars.\n\nVietnam alsopledged to crack downon fraud and illegal transshipments even before the deal was cut.Thailand,South KoreaandTaiwanhave also implemented or stepped up similar measures since April.\n\nThe U.S.-Vietnam deal, however, does not currently address industry-specific tariffs, including a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts and a 50% tariff on steel and aluminium, that are subject to pending Commerce Department investigations. It could also still dampen Vietnam’s economy: Bloomberg Economicsestimatesthat Vietnam could lose a quarter of its exports to the U.S. in the medium term under the deal, affecting more than 2% of its annual economic output.\n\nThe higher tariff on transshipments indirectly targets Chinese exports. China has routed its goods through other countries, including Vietnam, to bypass U.S. import levies, a practice thatbecame more frequentduring the U.S.-China trade war in Trump’s first term.\n\nEarlier this year, ahead of Trump’s tariffs in April, Chinese exports to Vietnam and Thailandrose sharply, which Brookings analysts suggest is unlikely to reflect a rise in domestic demand in those countries and is instead more likely to reflect transshipments to the U.S.\n\nChinese shipments to Southeast Asian rerouting hubs like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, alsosurged shortlybefore trade talks between China and the U.S. in May even as direct exports from China to the U.S. fell—suggesting that China was able to continue its flow of goods to the U.S. through transshipments even as countries touted crackdowns.\n\nIt’s too soon to tell how effective the transshipment clause and other measures will be in cracking down on fraud. “While the exact criteria for defining transshipment remain unclear, it is evident that Vietnam’s role as a potential connector for Chinese exports to the U.S. will diminish,” Su Yue, Principal China Economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told theSouth China Morning Post.\n\nBut some experts say at least some businesses may be willing to take the gamble, especially if the benefit of manufacturing in China outweighs the risk of getting caught.\n\n“The thing about trade is when there are huge arbitrage opportunities, people are going to find a way to take advantage of them, legally or illegally,” Caroline Freund, an expert on international trade at the University of California at San Diego,toldtheWashington Postin May. “It’s like a river. You can keep putting rocks in, but the water’s going to keep flowing down.”\n\nAsh Monga, who runs China-based supply chain management company IMEX Sourcing Services, tells TIME that in the wake of Trump’s tariffs, he noticed a rise in Chinese companies offering “Delivered Duty Paid” fraud services to U.S. importers, which involves underpricing goods in order to pay a lower duty. Suppliers in China would set up shell companies that would act as the “importer of record,” creating the perception among U.S. importers of lower risk. (Monga cautions that U.S. customs can still go after the U.S. businesses purchasing the goods from China and it can carry severe penalties.)\n\n“They are doing it because people are looking for solutions to lower the tariff,” Monga says. “Businesses were at risk of not surviving so they were desperate to find any solution” even if those solutions are fraudulent.\n\n“The looming question now is how China will respond,” Bloomberg Economics analyst Rana Sajediwrotein a research note. “Beijing has made clear that it would respond to deals that came at the expense of Chinese interests and the decision to agree to a higher tariff on goods deemed to be ‘transshipped’ through Vietnam may fall in that category.”\n\nChina vowed that it will retaliate if its interests are hurt by the U.S.-Vietnam trade deal.\n\n“We are happy to see all parties resolve trade conflicts with the U.S. through equal negotiations but firmly oppose any party striking a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yongqian said at a Thursday press conference, reiteratingearlier commentswarning countries against signing deals with the U.S. that shut out China. “If such a situation arises, China will firmly strike back to protect its own legitimate rights and interests.”\n\nOn top of that, China will likely view the relatively lower 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods as an effort to encourage firms to produce their goods in Vietnam over China. The U.S. and China said theyreached a framework agreementin June that will set U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 55% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports at 10%, alongside other export controls.\n\n“The ‘China quotient’ in U.S. negotiations with other Asian economies is arguably evident in the deal with Vietnam,” Vishnu Varathan, macro research head for Asia at Mizuho,wrotein a Thursday note. “The U.S.’s intent is quite obviously to not disincentivize Vietnam’s role as a substitute for China at a lower 20% tariff.”\n\nVietnam may soon find itself caught in a balancing act between two economic superpowers. Varathan wrote: “Other Asian economies will be particularly vulnerable to a two-sided geoeconomic squeeze given that their reliance on both China and U.S. are significant.”\n\nAnd some experts suggest that the U.S. wants to go beyond stopping illegal transshipments—it wants to shut China out of global supply chains entirely.\n\nThe U.S. has also been in talks with India that could involve an agreementrequiring a higher minimum amountof a product’s value to be added locally in order to qualify as “Made in India”—the U.S. is asking for that amount to be 60%, while India wants to bring it down to around 35%.\n\nThe U.K. also signed a trade deal with the U.S. in June thatincluded commitmentsaround export controls that could encourage British firms to exclude Chinese products from their supply chains. China’s foreign ministrycriticizedthe move, telling the Financial Times: “Co-operation between states should not be conducted against or to the detriment of the interests of third parties.”\n\n“The United States seems to be arguing that anything that comes from China is by default transshipment, so you tar and feather every single product that comes from China,” Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at Asia-based global trade research organization, the Hinrich Foundation,toldtheNew York Times. “Asian governments are being asked to redefine supply chains to something that might be decades in the making in exchange for what? It’s a little unclear.”\n\nContact usatletters@time.com.",

    "News_title":"NATO's big $1.4 trillion bet is seeing long-ignored air defenses coming back in a big way",
    "News_text":"NATO's chief has pledged a fivefold increase in air defenses.\n\nGround-based air defenses are an area that Western countries scaled back after the Cold War.\n\nBut the way Russia is fighting in Ukraine has proven its need.\n\nNATO pledged to massively increase its air defenses as part of soaring defense spending. The aim is to rebuild a capability that thewar in Ukrainehas shown to be crucial but has been allowed to wither in the West since the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe heads of government for the 32 members of the decades-old security alliance committed last week to investing 5% of their GDP on defense and security by 2035. The increase, based on current GDP size, could beworthmore than $1.4 trillion. NATO's secretary general, Mark Rutte, said one use for the money would be a \"fivefold increase in air defence capabilities.\"\n\nHe said the way Russia was fighting proved the need. \"We see Russia's deadly terror from the skies over Ukraine every day, and we must be able to defend ourselves from such attacks,\" he said.\n\nWestern countries reduced their ground-based air defense arsenals after the end of the Cold War as they found themselves involved in conflicts with much smaller, less powerful adversaries. This war has shown that Western stocks are insufficient.\n\nWestern countries have been fighting foes very much unlike Russia.Air superiorityhas been achieved with ease, enabling ground maneuvers. There hasn't been a pressing need for weapons to shoot down enemy aircraft and ballistic missiles, except in one-off instances.\n\nThe US and the rest of NATO scaled back their ground-based defenses \"very substantially,\" said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel who's now a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nDuring the Cold War, as tensions skyrocketed between NATO and the Soviet Union, Western countries maintained substantial defenses. But in the aftermath, Cancian said, \"it appeared that fighter aircraft could handle any air threat, and the need for ground-based air defenses was much reduced.\"\n\nDuring Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s, the US took control of the skies, and aircraft largely had free rein in the later wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the main threat being to low-flying aircraft, helicopters in particular.\n\nEd Arnold, an expert in European security at the Royal United Services Institute, said Europe deprioritized air defense at the end of the Cold War \"because the types of missions that the Europeans were doing were, for example, overseas where you only needed a small sort of section of it to be able to protect your forces in the field.\"\n\nRetired Air Commodore Andrew Curtis, an air warfare expert with a 35-year career in the Royal Air Force, said there had been \"an element of complacency\" in recent decades, but also an element of trying to prioritize what was needed when defense budgets shrank as countries felt safer in the post-Cold War era.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine, which followed earlier acts of aggression, suggests the world has changed. But, Curtis said, the West has to some extent been \"asleep at the wheel.\"\n\nThe problem now, explained Justin Bronk, an air power expert at RUSI, is \"that NATO faces a significant shortfall in ground-based air defense systems, both in terms of number of systems, but also particularly ammunition stocks for those systems.\"\n\nRuttewarnedearlier this month that NATO needed \"five times as many systems to defend ourselves\" and described the speed Russia was reconsituting its military as \"threatening.\"\n\nMany European countries have warnedRussia could attack elsewhere on the continentand are watching closely to see what weaponry and tactics it needs to be ready. The volume and variety of air attacks against Ukraine have thus made air defenses a top takeaway.\n\nRussia can launchhundreds of drones and missiles in a single day, and NATO's air defense networks aren't well designed to deal with these kinds of strike threats, such as explodingShahed-136drones backed by ballistic and cruise missiles.\n\nWestern countries need more defenses, as there are just so many air attacks. \"Even if only 10% get through, that still does a lot of damage,\" Cancian said.\n\nCancian said innovations in this war, such asdronesbeing usedmore than in any other conflict in history, pointed to evolutions in warfare that make having strong air defenses more necessary than ever before. Nations aren't just facing planes. It's aircraft, missiles, and drones, all able to bring destruction.\n\nAnd the solutions need to be layered to address threats within their cost range. For instance, high-endPatriot interceptorsworthmillions of dollarsaren't meant for cheap drones worth thousands.\n\nRetired Australian Army Maj. Gen. Mick Ryan, a warfare strategist, said countries have to find \"a balance\" between expensive systems such as the Patriot and the THAAD system, both made by Lockheed Martin, and lower-end systems.\n\nUkraine, for example, usesAI-controlled systems equipped with machine gunsto stop some smaller drones, and the US military has been experimenting with air-launched rockets as drone killers.\n\n\"It's not just all about the exquisite, expensive, and highly capable systems. You also need some of those lower-end systems,\" the retired general said, adding that the past three years had not only shown how important air defenses are, but also \"that the array of threats that air defenses have to deal with has broadened.\"\n\nSmaller weapons used in missile attacks, such as drones, can \"saturate and overwhelm an air defense system\" — atactic Russia has employed.\n\nFor the West, Europe in particular, the new emphasis on bolstering critical air defenses and the push to spend more aren't optional. \"It's not a choice. You absolutely have to do this,\" Ryan said.\n\nIt'd be impossibly expensive to protect everywhere, but the West will need to sort its priorities, balancing front-line demands with the protection of civilians in cities, something Ukraine has grappled with throughout the war.\n\n\"The biggest change, now as Ukraine is seeing, is you also need air defense to protect your civilians, all of your critical national infrastructure, and your forces in the field,\" Arnold said. \"So it's absolutely critical.\"\n\nNATO's new defense spending is set to be huge: No member currently spends that new 5% target, and the alliance estimated that many spent just over or below 2% in 2024. But spending doesn't automatically solve the problem.\n\nThere's a big production backlog with many systems, and increasing production capacity takes years, industrial revitalization, and workforce expertise, much of which has been diminished with time, leading to a hollowing out of the defense industrial sector.\n\nBronk said fixing this \"is much more a question of building production capacity at every stage in the supply chain as rapidly as possible as part of a crisis response rather than just spending more money.\" More production capacity is needed for interceptors.\n\nMore money and big orders help, though, by giving industry confidence to invest more in facilities and processes, but there has to be sustained investment.\n\nRutte pledged that NATO's increased spending would also be used on \"thousands more tanks and armoured vehicles\" and \"millions of rounds of artillery ammunition\" but said many plans were classified.\n\nRead the original article onBusiness Insider",

    "News_text":"(Refiles to include dropped phrase \"domestically held\" in paragraph 27, no other changes to story)\n\nGDANSK\/LONDON (Reuters) -The deadline U.S.President Donald Trumpset for major trading partners to strike deals with Washington or face heftytariffsexpires next week, bringing to a close 90 days of volatility but leaving global investors in the dark over what will happen next.\n\nTrump's propensity to issue a threat, or impose a new tariff, only to reverse course shortly afterwards has led to turmoil over the past three months.\n\nInvestors, however, have now become somewhat inured to this sort of policymaking on the fly. And, as a result, there is little evidence at this point that many are preparing for fireworks on July 9. Instead, most expect some kind of delay, pause or compromise.\n\nWhat that will look like, however, is anyone's guess.\n\nHere is a snapshot of where major markets are now, relative to where they were when Trump dropped his initial tariffs bombshell on April 2:\n\nTAKING STOCK OF STOCKS\n\nGlobal stock markets have staged a strong recovery following the intense volatility triggered by Trump's tariff announcement.\n\nThe MSCI World index, which fell 10% between April 2 and April 9, the day Trump paused the tariffs, has hit successive record highs and gained over 11% since the original \"Liberation Day\" announcement.\n\nGlobal equities got another boost in May, when the U.S. and China reached a temporary truce, pausing many tariffs for another 90 days. Geopolitical tensions, including Israel's recent strikes on Iran and Washington's subsequent bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, briefly reined in sentiment but have not derailed the broader rally.\n\nThe S&P 500, which had lagged other major equity markets earlier in the year, has closed those gaps, gaining over 10% since April 2, and is neck and neck with the MSCI all-country index, which excludes the United States.\n\nThere's an important caveat, however. The S&P has only hit record highs in dollar terms. The weakness in the U.S. currency has eroded the returns for overseas investors. In euro or Swiss franc terms, for example, the index is still about 10% below February's record high, while in pounds, it's 7% below the sterling-denominated peak.\n\nDOLLAR DECLINE\n\nThe U.S. dollar, widely regarded as the world's most powerful and stable currency, has suffered a knock to its reputation from Trump's tariffs and the subsequent 90-day pause.\n\nThe dollar index, which reflects the U.S. currency's performance against a basket of six others including the euro and the Japanese yen, suffered its worst first half of the year since 1973, declining by approximately 11%. It has fallen by 6.6% since April 2 alone.\n\nAgainst the currencies of some of the United States' biggest trading partners, the decline has been even more marked. It has lost some 8% against the euro and the Mexican peso since then and 5% against the Canadian dollar.\n\nVincent Mortier, the CIO of Europe's largest asset manager Amundi, said the euro has plenty more room to run, especially as U.S. debt worries are also driving the dollar down.\n\n\"I won't be surprised if by the end of next year we start to revisit the $1.30 level,\" he said, highlighting that at its 2008 peak, the euro got as high as $1.60.\n\nFOR EXPORTERS, CERTAINTY IS THE PRIZE\n\nEuropean shares have more than recovered losses suffered since Trump's \"Liberation Day\". But strength in the euro and anxiety over tariffs have kept them below March's record highs.\n\nLarge exporting sectors such as pharma and autos, which make up around one-third of EU exports to the United States, have rebounded too, but have been more volatile.\n\nBrussels is reportedly open to a U.S. deal that would apply a universal 10% tariff on many of its exports, something several investors would view favourably should it be confirmed. Citi said markets risk being caught offside if tariffs are reimposed at 20% or reach 50%.\n\n\"Trump is truly unpredictable, but if it's really around 10%, I think the markets will react very well,\" said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Banca Ifigest.\n\nThe impact of the trade talks extends beyond Europe, however, with automakers in Japan also being watched. Citi's base case is for a sustained 25% tariff, while a surprise cut to 10% could unlock a 50% upside for Japanese auto stocks.\n\nALL THAT GLITTERS\n\nGold has featured as the hedge of choice against an array of risks, from tariff-induced inflation, to geopolitical risk and a shift away from the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe price has hit record after record, rising 26% so far this year to around $3,330 an ounce. Gold has eclipsed bitcoin, which has gained about 14% year to date, and even Nvidia, the maker of chips that power AI capabilities, whose shares went parabolic last year and have risen about 18% this year.\n\nSince April 2, gold's ascent has gathered pace, fuelled by purchases from central banks, fund managers and even individuals.\n\nA survey by UBS Asset Management this week showed 39% of respondents said they planned to increase their domestically held gold holdings, compared with 15% last year. The independence of the Federal Reserve - whose chair, Jerome Powell, Trump has berated repeatedly for not cutting interest rates fast enough - is one of the key concerns cited in the survey.\n\n(Reporting by Canan Sevgili and Alberto Chiumento in Gdansk, Danilo Masoni in Milan and Alun John, Marc Jones and Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by Joe Bavier)",

    "News_title":"From Dogfights to Dominance: A Salute to U.S. Military Aircraft",
    "News_text":"Some own the skies. Others slip through them unseen. But every aircraft in this list has one thing in common: they’ve redefined what’s possible when metal meets mission.\n\nFrom the thunder of the F-15 to the silent glide of the U-2, American military aircraft have shaped the battlefield, broken records, and saved lives. Some are built for speed. Others for stealth. All of them are built to win.\n\nThis list highlights aircraft that made a major impact — technologically, historically, or strategically. We looked for innovation, legacy, and real-world effectiveness across combat, transport, recon, and support roles. Some are icons. Some are under-the-radar legends. All are unforgettable.\n\nStealthy, blisteringly fast, and razor-sharp in the sky, the F-22 Raptor was built to win wars before they start. Designed with radar-evading stealth, thrust-vectoring engines, and next-gen avionics, it can outclimb, outturn, and outthink anything in its path. Pilots don’t just fly the Raptor — they command the skies with it.\n\nIt’s so advanced, it’s almost unfair. In most encounters, the enemy never even knows it’s there. That’s the point. The F-22 doesn’t need to fight often—because when it shows up, the fight’s already over.\n\nBuilt for high-altitude reconnaissance at speeds exceeding Mach 3, the SR-71 soared above threats, snapping photos from the edge of space. Its sleek, titanium body stretched from the heat of its own velocity, and it could outrun any missile ever fired at it. No weapons, no defenses, just raw speed and altitude.\n\nIt didn’t need to fight. It just needed to know. The Blackbird wasn’t just ahead of its time — it’s still ahead ofourtime.\n\nDesigned around its massive GAU-8 Avenger rotary cannon, the A-10 is built to get in low, hit hard, and come back in one piece. It can loiter over the battlefield, support ground troops with pinpoint accuracy, and shrug off serious damage thanks to its armored cockpit and redundant systems.\n\nIt may not win beauty contests, but in a firefight, it’s the jet you want overhead. Rugged, relentless, and ridiculously effective—when the A-10 growls, enemies run.\n\nThe F-14 earned pop culture fame inTop Gun, but its real-life performance was even more impressive. Equipped with variable-geometry wings that adjusted mid-flight for speed or agility, it was a carrier-based interceptor designed to protect fleets at long range.\n\nArmed with long-range Phoenix missiles and powerful radar, it could engage multiple targets before they even saw it coming. From Cold War standoffs to Gulf War missions, the Tomcat was the Navy’s high-flying guardian—and one of the most iconic fighters ever built.\n\nThe C-130 has been flying since the 1950s, and it’s still going strong. Its rugged design, short takeoff and landing capability, and ability to operate on dirt runways make it invaluable for missions in war zones, disaster zones, and anywhere else roads don’t go.\n\nIt’s been a troop transport, flying hospital, cargo hauler, gunship (as the AC-130), and hurricane hunter. Few aircraft have done as much for as long. When the world needs help, the Hercules is often the first to arrive and the last to leave.\n\nWith an undefeated air-to-air combat record, the F-15 Eagle has earned its legendary status. Introduced in the 1970s, it was designed with one mission in mind: air superiority. And it delivered. With blistering speed over Mach 2.5, a powerful radar, and the ability to carry a full load of missiles, it dominates both long-range engagements and close-in dogfights.\n\nIts reputation isn’t just hype; it’s backed by decades of real-world performance. Pilots trust the Eagle to get them into the fight and bring them back out on top. In the world of air combat, it’s the gold standard.\n\nWith its sleek flying wing design and radar-evading skin, the B-2 Spirit is the pinnacle of stealth technology. It was built to go where no other bomber could—deep into defended airspace—and deliver precision strikes without alerting enemy defenses. It doesn’t just avoid detection; it redefines what “invisible” means in modern warfare.\n\nCapable of carrying both conventional and nuclear payloads, the B-2 isn’t just about stealth—it’s about strategic reach. With intercontinental range and pinpoint accuracy, it gives commanders the ability to strike globally, quietly, and with devastating precision.\n\nIntroduced in the late 1970s, the F-16 Fighting Falcon quickly became one of the most successful combat aircraft ever built. Its frameless bubble canopy offers unmatched visibility, while its fly-by-wire controls and aerodynamic design give it razor-sharp agility in a fight. It’s fast, fierce, and flexible—just what you need in unpredictable airspace.\n\nWhat sets the F-16 apart is its adaptability. From dogfights to bombing runs, from close air support to surveillance, this jet handles it all with ease. It's battle-tested, budget-friendly, and beloved by pilots around the world—proof that you don’t have to be the biggest to be the best.\n\nDon’t let her age fool you: the U-2 is still one of the most effective reconnaissance platforms ever built. First taking flight in the 1950s, this high-altitude spy plane was designed to fly above enemy radar and snap photos that could change the course of history. Its long, slender wings and lightweight frame allow it to cruise at altitudes over 70,000 feet — well above commercial air traffic and most missile threats.\n\nFlying the U-2 is no small feat. Pilots wear pressure suits like astronauts, and landings require help from a chase car. But the payoff is unmatched visibility from the edge of space. Whether it’s tracking troop movements or natural disasters, the Dragon Lady delivers eyes in the sky where satellites can’t.\n\nBorn in the early days of the Cold War, the B-52 was built to carry nuclear payloads deep into enemy territory—and more than 70 years later, it’s still flying high. With eight engines, a massive wingspan, and the ability to fly over 8,000 miles without refueling, the Stratofortress is a symbol of long-range power and endurance.\n\nWhat makes it remarkable isn’t just its size or payload—it’s its adaptability. The B-52 has been continuously upgraded with modern avionics, precision weapons, and electronic warfare systems, keeping it relevant across generations. It’s flown in every major conflict from Vietnam to the Middle East and will likely stay in service into the 2050s. When it comes to strategic airpower, the B-52 doesn’t just make history—it outlasts it.\n\nThe V-22 Osprey rewrote the rules of military aviation with its unique tiltrotor design. It can take off and land like a helicopter, then rotate its engines forward and fly like a turboprop plane, combining vertical lift with the speed and range of fixed-wing aircraft. That makes it perfect for missions that demand flexibility, like troop transport, medevac, and special ops insertions in hard-to-reach places.\n\nUsed by the Marines, Air Force, and Navy, the Osprey fills a gap that no other aircraft could. Whether landing on a ship, dodging small arms fire, or delivering a quick reaction force to a mountaintop, the V-22 brings speed, reach, and versatility to the modern battlefield.\n\nThe F-35 isn’t just a jet—it’s a flying command center. Designed with stealth in mind, it can slip past radar, collect vast amounts of intel, and share that data in real time with other forces. Its advanced sensors, helmet-mounted display, and low observable profile make it one of the most formidable multirole fighters in service today.\n\nAvailable in three variants for the Air Force (F-35A), Navy (F-35C), and Marines (F-35B), the Lightning II brings next-gen capability to nearly every corner of the U.S. military. Whether it’s engaging enemy aircraft, conducting close air support, or operating from an aircraft carrier, the F-35 is built to adapt, survive, and dominate.\n\nThe C-17 is the muscle of modern military logistics, able to transport massive loads—like tanks, troops, or humanitarian supplies—across continents in a single flight. But what makes it stand out isn’t just its size; it’s the precision. This giant can land on short, rough airstrips and maneuver like an aircraft half its size.\n\nWhether it’s dropping paratroopers into combat zones or delivering aid after natural disasters, the C-17 shines in missions where speed, scale, and flexibility matter most. It’s not just a transport—it’s a global lifeline with wings.\n\nArmed to the teeth with Hellfire missiles, Hydra rockets, and a 30mm chain gun that tracks with the pilot’s helmet, the Apache is the ultimate aerial predator. It’s built to survive—able to keep flying even after sustaining heavy damage—and designed to strike fast, hard, and with surgical precision.\n\nSince the 1980s, it’s been the go-to gunship for missions where ground troops need backup that shows up fast and hits even faster. From urban warfare to desert showdowns, the Apache doesn’t just fly—it hunts.\n\nSince 1957, the KC-135 has kept the U.S. military flying farther, longer, and faster by delivering fuel where it’s needed most—midair, at 30,000 feet, traveling hundreds of miles an hour. This aerial refueling tanker has supported every major conflict from the Cold War to today, enabling missions that would otherwise be impossible.\n\nIt’s not flashy, but it’s vital. Without it, fighters and bombers would be limited by fuel tanks. With it, they’re global. The KC-135 is the force multiplier you don’t see coming—until you realize it’s the reason everything else can keep going.\n\nWith its twin rotors and massive lift capacity, the CH-47 Chinook is the backbone of battlefield logistics. It can haul troops, supplies, artillery, and even other helicopters through high altitudes and tight mountain passes—all while taking a beating and staying airborne.\n\nFrom Vietnam to modern-day conflicts, the Chinook has proven itself as one of the most versatile and durable helicopters in the world. Whether dropping into remote outposts or pulling off daring extractions, it’s the go-to bird when strength, speed, and stability matter most.\n\nFrom silent spies to supersonic screamers,America’s military aircrafthave reshaped the skies and redefined what’s possible. These machines pushed the limits of engineering, carried out missions no one else could, and changed the course of history from thousands of feet in the air. Each one tells a story of innovation, resilience, and precision, earning its place not just in the sky but in the legacy of airpower.\n\nLike our content?Follow usfor more.Read More:\n\nOverlooked, Underpriced, and Built to Thrill—These Cars Are Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nFast, Fun, and (Maybe) Profitable: Sports Cars That Might Pay You Back",

    "News_text":"Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) has risen by over 3.5% in the past 24 hours, with volume in the Deribit-listed options market suggesting bullish expectations.\n\nSince July 1, higher-level July 25 call options at strikes of $3.00 and $4.00 and the Sept. 28 expiry call at the $2.80 strike have emerged as the most traded bets, according to data source Amberdata.\n\nA call option gives the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price at a later date. The option represents a bullish view on the market. For instance, the $3 strike call buyer is betting that XRP's spot price will top that level by July 25. On Deribit, one options contract represents one XRP.\n\nA closer look at the flows reveals that the higher volume ranking for the $3 calls primarily stems from buy trades. In the past 24 hours, the $3 strike call has seen 2 million contracts change hands in investor buy trades (market makers on the opposite side). Conversely, investors have been mostly sellers or writers in the $2.8 call.\n\nThe $3 call is also the most popular bet in terms of the increase in open interest, or the number of active or open contracts, in the past seven days.\n\nThe increased activity in the higher strike calls follows strengthening expectations for a spot ETF debut in the U.S. According to Bloomberg's analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, the probability that the U.S. SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF now stands at 95% – almost a done deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, fintech firm Ripple, which utilizes XRP to facilitate cross-border transactions, announced that it has applied for a national banking license at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).\n\n\"If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market,\" Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on X.\n\nXRP's bitcoin-denominated price, represented by the Binance-listed XRP\/BTC pair, may be headed higher, having broken out of a falling wedge pattern.\n\nThe falling wedge is a bullish reversal pattern, characterized by two converging trendlines that indicate a narrowing range of price movement. The converging nature of trendlines suggests that sellers are slowly losing steam. Hence, a subsequent move above the upper trendline is said to confirm renewed bull dominance.\n\nXRP\/BTC has risen above the upper trendline, confirming the bullish breakout. The pattern indicates that the correction from the April highs has ended and the broader XRP bullish trend has resumed.\n\nWhile the wedge breakout indicates that the path of least resistance is on the higher side, popular averages, 50-day, 100-day and 200-day SMAs disagree.\n\nBoth the 50- and 100-day SMAs are trending south, having recently crossed bearishly below the 200-day SMA. Note, however, that moving averages are lagging indicators and take backseat to the bullish wedge breakout.\n\nRead more:Ripple Applies for Federal Bank Trust Charter, XRP Jumps 3%",

    "News_title":"LL Cool J says he won't perform at Philadelphia's July Fourth festival in support of workers strike",
    "News_text":"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Rapper LL Cool J and R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan say they will not perform at a Fourth of July festival in Philadelphia in support of a strikeby nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia.\n\nLL Cool J had been scheduled to appear at the Wawa Welcome America Festival on Friday, along with Sullivan and other performers.\n\nLL Cool J said in a video posted on social media that “there's absolutely no way that I can perform, cross a picket line and pick up money when I know that people are out there fighting for a living wage.”\n\n“I hope, I hope, I hope that, you know, the mayor and the city can make a deal. I hope it works out,” he said.\n\nLL Cool J also said that he never wants to disappoint his fans and that he plans to be in Philadelphia in case an agreement is reached.\n\nThe festival comes as the strike moved into a fourth day Friday.Trash has been piling up in some areas, and more than 30 Medical Examiner’s Office staffers have been ordered back to work because of a growing backlog of bodies in storage.\n\nSullivan, a Philadelphia native and Grammy award-winning artist, said in a post on Instagram on Friday that she would stand with the striking workers “until the city and the union find a way to bring fair living wages to our working class. I love my city and I believe in you,” she wrote. “Hopefully we will get to celebrate when things are better.”\n\nThe latest talks between the city and leaders of District Council 33 — the largest of four major unions representing city workers — ended late Wednesday. Both sides have said they were willing to continue negotiations. The union represents many of the city’s blue-collar workers, from trash collectors to clerks to security guards. Police and firefighters are not on strike.\n\nThe city has offered a three-year contract with annual raises of about 3%, which the union said amounts to little more than $1,000 after taxes for members making $46,000 a year on average.\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker has said the city has “put its best offer on the table.” She stressed that the effective 13% pay hike over her four-year term -- including last year’s 5% bump – along with a fifth step on the pay scale would be the best contract the union has seen in decades.\n\nParker responded to LL Cool J's statement, saying that she spoke with him on Thursday.\n\n\"I respect his decision, and understand his desire to see the city unified,\" the mayor said. “He is always welcome in Philadelphia.”\n\nThe union also responded, saying LL Cool J's support for municipal workers “highlights his commitment to social justice and community well-being.”\n\n“His support not only brings attention to our efforts but also inspires others to recognize and advocate for the rights and respect of all workers,” the union said. “It’s heartening to see public figures using their influence to champion causes that matter to everyday people.”\n\nOn Thursday, Common Pleas Court Judge Sierra Thomas-Street approved the city’s request to have the medical examiner’s office staffers return to work because bodies have been piling up there in storage, posing a health and safety risk. Those workers include death and forensic investigators, forensic technicians and clerks.\n\nThe order came a day after the judge ordered some emergency service dispatchers and essential water department employees back to work.\n\nMounting trash piles in some parts of the city were also still causing grief for residents and officials, who have strongly urged residents to follow the collection guidelines imposed when the strike began Tuesday. They also urged residents to report problems at the trash collection sites, and noted trash is being cleared as fast as possible and the city is working to open more sites.",

    "News_text":"A TV monitor shows an earthquake that occurred off the coast of the Tokara Islands in Japan, on July 3, 2025. The epicenter was 20 kilometers deep, and the magnitude of the earthquake was estimated to be 5.5. Credit - Yomiuri Shimbun via AP Images\n\nEarthquakescan’t be predicted. Scientists agree that precise predictions of a time, place, and magnitude is not possible with current technologies.\n\nYet a years-old Japanese manga thatclaimsa “megaquake”—thoseabove a magnitude of 8.0on the Richter scale—will strike on July 5 has generated panic and deterred some inbound travelers for the past several months.\n\nThe 2021 reprint ofThe Future I Sawby Ryo Tatsuki, a retiredmangakain her 70s, warns that a “huge” tsunami “three times the size” of the 2011Great East Japan Earthquakewill wash over countries in the Pacific Ocean. The first edition of the manga, published in 1999, had referred to a “great disaster” in March 2011 that coincided with the earthquake that killedmore than 18,000 peopleand caused theFukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster.\n\nLast month, Tatsuki appeared to scale back her prediction about a July 5 megaquake, telling the national newspaperSankeithat it may not happen. But she fell short of entirely withdrawing her warning. TIME has reached out to Tatsuki for comment.\n\nThe 2021 reprint has sold more than 1millioncopies in Japan, andsocial media contentthat has racked up millions of views is fueling the scientifically unfounded fears.\n\nIn recent weeks, two Hong Kong-based airlines alone havecut down on flightsto southern Japan due to lower passenger interest. “We are surprised that such rumors have led to cancellations,” the Tokushima Tourism promotion division said.\n\nThe Japanese government has warned about earthquake speculation. InApril, it released a statement that, “predicting earthquakes by specifying the date, time, and location is difficult with current scientific knowledge.” Last month, Japan Meteorological Agency director-general Ryoichi Nomurasaidin a news conference that it was “regrettable that people are being affected by baseless information in this age of modern science.”\n\nJapan has long been a hotbed of seismic activity due to its position in the Pacific Ring of Fire. In August, JMAissued an advisorythat “the likelihood of a new major earthquake is higher than normal” in relation to the Nankai Trough, a 560 mi. oceanic trench to Japan’s south. Earthquakes arising from the Nankai Trough are as the geologists Kyle Bradley and Judith A. Hubbard put it, “the original definition of the ‘Big One.’”\n\nEarlier this year, a government panelissued a reportstating that a megaquake along the Nankai Trough has an 80% chance of happening in the next 30 years. Under theworst-case scenario, as many as 298,000 people could die, the report added.\n\nJapan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year,almost a fifthof the global total. The country has spent decades puttingearthquake preparedness plansin place.\n\nGiven the history and frequency of earthquakes in Japan, concern is understandable.

    "News_text":"AutoZone has delivered strong returns and continues to expand its business and store count.\n\nRoku offers an early-stage growth opportunity in streaming and is still flying under the radar.\n\nIBM is tapping into the AI boom and remains a solid pick for long-term investors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Roku ›\n\nSome investors trade often. Others take their time before pouncing on any particular stock, focusing on long-term investments they can just forget about for decades.\n\nImagine you're setting up a brand new portfolio for the long haul. Sure, you could stick with a tried and trueS&P 500index fundand call it a day, but you want to beat the market with this mini-portfolio. And it needs to be a low-effort activity, where you can forget about checking up on its stocks for decades -- and never lose a minute of sleep over their performance.\n\nIn this case, you should have a couple of clear objectives in mind:\n\nMany years of longevity and business growth. A true long-term investment should still be relevant and thriving in a decade or three.\n\nAcompetitive edge. Why settle for a decent performer in a strong industry when you can insist on top-shelf excellence?\n\nA diverse group of stocks. The markets will ebb and flow over time, so your long-term investment bets should have distinctly different target markets. A focused artificial intelligence (AI) portfolio is one thing, and a broad basket of long-haul growth stocks is another.\n\nSo here are three growth stocks that meet all of these criteria. They are built to last, set up for long-lasting business growth, and leaders in their chosen fields. Together, their wide range of innovative operations should provide you with strong average returns across a wide range of stock market conditions.\n\nJust buy them and jump in the lazy river, watch your kids grow up, or learn guitar over the next couple of decades. You won't have to worry about your growth stocks.\n\nCar parts retailerAutoZone(NYSE: AZO)is a surprising performer. The stock has gained 238% over the last 5 years and 16% in the first half of 2025. These are market-beating returns, comparable to fellow sector giantO'Reilly Automotive(NASDAQ: ORLY).\n\nI wouldn't hate it if you picked O'Reilly instead of AutoZone, but this company has a couple of important advantages over the competition. First, the stock trades at significantly lower valuation multiples across the board. AutoZone also sports 12% higher annual revenues than O'Reilly, not to mention 8% richer bottom-line earnings. It even has an edge in long-term sales growth rates and a stronger balance sheet.\n\nThe company isn't sitting on its work-gloved hands, either. AutoZone is making heavy investments in a more capable supply chain, while also opening 84 net new stores in the recently reported Q3 of 2025.\n\nAnd this happens to be a great time to stock up on shares in the retail sector. Many investors worry about tariffs and international conflicts, both of which can make consumers less likely to spend money. But I'm sure Americans will continue to fix and maintain their cars, regardless of the political climate. AutoZone should remain a leading name in that game for years and years, producing robust stock returns in the process.\n\nI keep coming back toRoku(NASDAQ: ROKU)when I'm looking for long-term growth stories. The media-streaming expert also happens to be undervalued most of the time, making it an easy pick in a crowded market.\n\nSure, I could have recommended Roku's former parent companyNetflix(NASDAQ: NFLX)instead. Both companies are exploring a global media market with top-notch innovation under their belts and promising growth trends. But Roku is at an earlier stage of its international growth story, with so much untapped market value left to grab. Netflix is far from stalled out -- but Roku is just getting started. This is the more exciting growth story today.\n\nThe company is currently unprofitable, but that's by design. Roku's management is throwing everything but the kitchen sink at the company's growth opportunities, investing in everything from original content to powerful advertising platforms. The stock has been disappointing in recent years, but I see the downtrend as a wide-open buying window. If Roku isn't beating the market by 2035, I'll buy a hat just to eat it. Hold the salt, please.\n\nFinally, let's tap into the unstoppable generative AI boom.IBM(NYSE: IBM)may not strike you as a leader in that jam-packed industry, but that's a mistake. Big Blue is simply going after a different customer population than its headline-writing AI peers. As always, IBM is all about business-class services for enterprise customers. It's a massive target market, IBM's long-term AI focus is starting to pay off right now, and the stock looks dirt cheap anyhow.\n\nIBM shares are changing hands at the affordable price of 4.3 times sales or 21.5 times free cash flows. If IBM were a part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" group, it would be the lowest-priced option in terms of cash flow-based valuations.\n\nPlus, this company wrote the book on business longevity. IBM was founded more than a century ago, thriving despite a couple of world wars and a variety of economic crises. Big Blue should be the first place to look when you're on the hunt for long-term investment ideas.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

They rejected it and came back with very much the same proposal that they’ve had over the last three days.”\n\nThe union thanked LL Cool J on Instagram for not crossing the picket line.\n\n“It’s truly a disgrace when a celebrity who wasn’t born or raised here has more respect for hard working union men and women than our own city administration,”the union wrote on Instagram.\n\nParker wrote on Facebookthat she spoke with LL Cool J and she respects his decision not to perform at the Fourth of July concert.\n\n“I am aware that LL Cool J has decided not to perform at WAWA Welcome America’s July 4th Concert tomorrow evening on the Parkway,” Parker said in a statement. “I spoke personally with LL Cool J today.

    "News_title":"Interceptor drones will decide Europe’s fate. Here’s why",
    "News_text":"Credit: Telegram \/ reDrone\n\nAre you looking for a career change? A stimulating challenge? Maybe a job where you can truly be who you always wanted to be?\n\nUkraine’s western air command may have just the thing for you: flying interceptor drones. A role, it announced in a recent Facebook post, that is “very interesting”, “promising” and will allow successful applicants to “express” themselves.\n\nIt’s not the usual language of a recruiting sergeant in a war of national survival, but nor is it entirely misleading. For the interceptor drone is rapidly emerging as the most important weapon in the age of automated warfare.\n\nIndeed, from Nato’s headquarters in Brussels, to the halls of military power in Beijing, military officials may soon be racing to acquire their own.\n\nThefirst Russian drone attack to hit Kyivin October 2022 involved nearly 30 Shaheds, the 8ft-wide, Iranian-designed kamikaze drone that has become the mainstay of Russia’s bombing campaign.\n\nSince then,the petrol-motor buzz of approaching Shaheds, thought to cost between $20,000-$50,000 (£14,000-£36,000) a unit, has become all too familiar to Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. All the while, the drone swarms have grown ever larger.\n\nOvernight on Thursday, just afterDonald Trump called Vladimir Putinto propose a ceasefire,Russia launched 539 drones and 11 missiles in the biggest single air attack of the war.\n\nThe Ukrainian air force said almost all – 478 – of them were shot down or crashed en route, probably as a result of electronic counter measures.\n\nBut it was only the latest in a series of record-breaking mass drone attacks.\n\n“Since mid-May they’ve set the record for the largest Shahed attack about six times,” says Marcel Plichta, a former US Army intelligence analyst and drone warfare expert. He adds that these cheap, mass attacks pose a financial (as well as logistical) problem for Ukraine’s air defence.\n\n“A conventional air-defence missile, even one that is an order of magnitude cheaper than a Patriot missile, is still going to be triple or quadruple the cost of one of these drones.\n\n“Now, air defence is never going to be economical. But those are very bad numbers if you’re using some of the more expensive systems.”\n\nA few nights picked at random from the last month illustrate the scale of the problem.\n\nOn the evening of June 14 to 15, Ukraine’s air force reported that Russia had launched 183 Shaheds and decoys.Two nights later, they launched 440. Then, on June 22 to 23, another 352. The night of June 25 to 26, the Russians launched just 41, but the following evening the so-called “strike package” was back up to 363.\n\nAnd then, on the last Saturday evening in June, Russia launched 477 drones and decoys and more than 60 missiles, setting the record for the biggest air attack of its kind until yesterday’s raid.\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian electronic warfare expert, told Ukrainian media last month that he expects Russian strike packages to grow to as many as 800-a-day as they continue to expand production.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official said it could reach 1000-a-day. He added that conventional air-defence systems were too expensive to be a long-term solution, and said electronic counter-measures were simply not effective enough to provide blanket protection.\n\nUkraine also uses “mobile air-defence teams” – soldiers with Browning machine guns or PKM’s, the heavy version of the Kalashnikov – to shoot down drones flying close to the ground (which they do to avoid Ukrainian radar).\n\nBut Russia has become wise to this tactic and started flying its drones higher again, as well as employing “decoy” drones – drones with no bombs on them – to tempt Ukraine to waste even more missiles.\n\n“So,” says the senior Ukrainian official, “the answer has to be interceptors.”\n\nFive models of interceptors – a drone designed to take out another drone – have so far been approved for use by the Ukrainian military (it is not known how much they each cost, per unit).\n\nOne unveiled by Ukraine’s western air command this month is a flying-wing shaped, rail-launched craft that looks a bit like a Stealth bomber, and which a grown man can just about carry under one arm. Others look “a bit like an American football with wings”, says Bob Tollast, of the Royal United Services Institute. The Ukrainian Wild Hornets group has one called Sting, with four large fins attached, for hunting Shaheds.\n\nMeanwhile, Western companies are busy developing their own offerings. The Bristol-based company MARSS advertises a similar cruciform model that it says can “defeat multiple small drones in a single mission”.\n\nAnduril, the American tech and arms company, sells two interceptors, one called a Roadrunner, and one called an Anvil, which “navigates autonomously to intercept potential drone threats”.\n\nThere’s no standard design, but the one thing that holds true, from Kyiv to California via Bristol, is the size of the companies involved.\n\n“It’s the ‘tech bro’ side of defence that’s moving faster on this, rather than the defence giants,” says Plichta, referring to companies which span digital innovation and defence like America’s Anduril and Palantir, as well as Epirus, which is behind Leonidas, an anti-drone swarm energy weapon.\n\nRegardless of the specific design, all interceptor drones have to overcome certain challenges. By definition they must all be faster, and thus probably more expensive, than the object they are trying to hit. That often means making them small, to maximise speed and range.\n\nAn explosive warhead increases damage, but also adds weight, so some, like the offering from MAARS, are simply flying battering rams designed to knock targets out of the sky. If they want a higher kill ratio than one-to-one, interceptors have to be able to survive multiple collisions and keep flying, so they need to be tough.\n\nFinally, you need lots of drones, and lots of pilots to fly them, as the war in Ukraine has demonstrated.\n\n“If you think about it, you need at least one interceptor drone per Shahed. But you also need that volume spread around the areas they attack – that tends to be Kyiv and Odesa and cities in the middle of the country – or the paths to them. And then you have to account for flexibility, because it’s quite easy for the Russians to change flight paths,” says Plichta.\n\n“When you take all of that into account, it’s not so much that the technology isn’t there, or that there aren’t prototypes, or that there aren’t working copies. It’s just a scale issue.”\n\nFour-hundred Shaheds per night, one interceptor per Shahed, and one drone pilot per interceptor – even if AI-targeting eventually removes the last part of that equation, the logistical tail builds up rapidly. Without cost oversight, deploying the “cheap” interceptors can rapidly get expensive.\n\nGeneral Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of the Ukrainian armed forces, told journalists last month that to be effective, interceptor teams also need tactical mini radars – essential for reconnaissance work, and of which Ukraine currently has only a handful.\n\nAnd even if those logistical issues can be overcome, interceptor drones have their limitations. “We’re already using them, and we are expanding their use. But they can’t replace everything. We have to understand that anti-drone air defence is a complex system,” Yuriy Ignat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian air force, tellsThe Telegraph.\n\n“First, they don’t have a very long range – only a few dozen kilometres. Secondly, you need to scale up the depth of territory they cover. They only work locally. And they can’t always fly, in bad weather, fog, and so on.”\n\nWhich is why Ukrainian MiG-29 and F-16 jets remain crucial to air-defence missions; why conventional systems, from state-of-the-art Patriot missiles, to the basic cannons of German Flakpanzer Gepards, continue to be deployed; and why the low-tech, machine-gun-on-a-truck teams still account for nearly half of all intercepts.\n\nNor is improvisation limited to drones. Britain recently announced that it was sending Ukraine 350 air-to-air ASRAAM missiles, adapted by RAF engineers to fire from the back of an improvised truck.\n\nElectronic warfare – the jamming and counter-jamming of radio frequencies and GPS signals – remains a rapidly evolving battlefield. One innovation saw Russian operators work out how to piggyback on Ukraine’s domestic mobile network for drone navigation. The next Ukrainian move is working out how to cut them off.\n\nThis is not just a Ukrainian problem. Nato countries are scrambling to find a solution to a mass aerial threat unseen since the 1,000-bomber raids of the Second World War. Some have already spent billions, with mixed results.\n\nIn Britain, there has been work on an experimental laser cannon called DragonFire, which the government claims costs £10 to fire, and can hit “any visible target”. The Royal Navy plans to mount it on at least four warships by 2027.\n\nIn April, the Ministry of Defence announced that British soldiers had successfully destroyed a 100-drone swarm in tests of a directed energy weapon called RapidDestroyer, a huge metal box which uses high frequency radio waves to fry UAV electronics at a cost of 10p a shot.\n\nInitial outlay on such systems is high, and they would make juicy targets for the enemy. But because their cost to fire is so low, over time they may prove cost effective, particularly against mass attack.\n\n“The Pentagon bought just four directed energy weapons for about $66 million (£49.5m). Firing them, they don’t need a bunch of ammunition,” says Zachary Kallenborn, a drone warfare expert at King’s College London. “They just need power. So over time that high cost becomes affordable. The problem is, what happens if your adversary just blows the crap out of it?”\n\nAnd arms manufacturers, like car makers, tend to issue somewhat optimistic performance statistics with their products. Taking down a 100-drone swarm is plausible, says Kallenborn, but what were the environmental conditions when the test took place? How large or armoured were the drones? At what angles were they approaching? All those factors can complicate real-world operations.\n\nLast year Doug Bush, the head of US Army acquisition, told the Senate armed forces committee that field tests of a vehicle-mounted 50-kilowatt laser in the Middle East had revealed challenges with keeping it charged and hitting targets at range, without dust or other interference dissipating the beam.\n\nHence the importance of the interceptor drone.\n\nIn 1940, Winston Churchill praised the bravery of “the Few” meeting waves of Luftwaffe raiders. Today, in the age of automated warfare, defence of the skies may come down to the many, if not countless, flying robots and their operators.\n\n“In a lot of ways, it does take us back to the Battle of Britain and the Blitz, with the difference that what is sacrificed instead of people is money,” says Plichta. “Like then, it is about scaling up in range and number, to have enough of these aircraft in the right place at the right time to stop an attack.”\n\nUntil a better solution is found, it seems, the best defence against a hostile drone swarm will be a drone swarm of your own.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Putin orders largest bombardment of Ukraine after call with Trump",
    "News_text":"Vladimir Putin ordered the largest-ever bombardment of Ukraine hours after coming off the phoneto Donald Trump.\n\nMore than 550 drones and missiles were launched at Ukraine overnight, with Kyiv bearing the brunt of the seven-hour barrage. It left one dead, 23 injured and the capital choked by explosions, smoke and fires.\n\n“Absolutely horrible and sleepless night in Kyiv. One of the worst so far. Hundreds of Russian drones and ballistic missiles rained down on the Ukrainian capital, right after Putin spoke with President Trump,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said.\n\nMr Trump described his phone call with the Russian leaderas “disappointing” and said he was “not happy”about the war in Ukraine. However, he stopped short of calling for Putin to end to the conflict.\n\n“I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with president Putin, because I don’t think he’s there,” the US president told reporters on Thursday night. “I’m just sayingI don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”\n\nHours after the barrage, the Kremlin said it saw no immediate diplomatic way out of the war, and brushed off future peace talks.\n\nYuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide, claimed Putin and Mr Trump were “on the same page” after the sixth known call between the two leaders. But Mr Trump disagreed, saying: “I didn’t make any progress with him at all.”\n\nKyiv and other major cities across Ukraine have come under intensified bombardment in recent weeks. Russia is producing drones in record numbers andlaunching them in ever-larger volleys, in what analysts say is a strategy intended to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defence network through relentless attacks and break the population’s morale.\n\nIn total, 539 drones and 11 missiles were fired overnight on Friday, according to Ukraine’s air force.\n\nReacting to the onslaught, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called on the US to increase pressure on Russia, warning that Moscow would not “change its dumb, destructive behaviour”.\n\nIn a later phone call, Mr Trump agreed to help Ukraine protect its skies, despite pausing some vital shipments of Patriot air defence missiles earlier this week.\n\nLike those before it, Friday’s attack included a combination ofIranian-designed Shahed dronesand ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as decoys sent to confuse Ukraine’s defences.\n\n“Today’s attack was like the worst nightmare come to life,” Olha Vershynina, a Kyiv resident, told the Kyiv Independent. “Because when the strike happened, the lights went out and glass came crashing down on my head. It was terrifying. Our entire building was shaking.”\n\n“President Trump, Putin is mocking your peace efforts,” Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, wrote on social media, after the Polish embassy in Kyiv was damaged in the strikes.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, said Russia would prefer to achieve its goals through “political and diplomatic avenues”, but that “as long as this remains unattainable, the special military operation will continue”.\n\nFriday’s attack damaged apartment buildings, businesses, a school, a medical facility and other civilian infrastructure in districts across Kyiv.\n\n“This time was truly terrifying,” Maria Maznichenko, a pensioner who lives in Kyiv’s Solomianskyi district, added. “The explosions kept coming. Shahed drones were flying in every minute, like a swarm of bees – one after another.”\n\nTymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv’s military administration, warned residents to close their windows because of the dangerous levels of “combustion products” in the air. “The Russians bring nothing but terror and murder. That is a fact,” he wrote on Telegram during the bombardment.\n\nAfter the hours-long barrage, Mr Trump spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart and the pair agreed to work together to “strengthen” Ukraine’s air defences, Mr Zelensky said. Details are not yet clear, but the Ukrainian president suggested they discussed joint production of key air defence systems.\n\nThe Trump administration said earlier this week that it would pause shipments of certain critical weapons to Ukraine, including 30 promised Patriot air defence missiles, due to low stockpiles. The vital supplies had been expected in the coming weeks or months.\n\nKyiv warned that the decision would weaken its ability to defend its cities against Russia’s intensifying air strikes and battlefield advances.\n\nOne source briefed on the call said they were optimistic that Patriot supplies could resume after what they called a “very good” conversation between the presidents.\n\nUkraine is reliant on the US-made Patriot missiles as its only line of defence against certain types of Russian ballistic missile – including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which was used in Friday’s barrage.\n\nGermany said on Friday it would try to fill the air defence gap, and that it was in “intensive talks” to buy Patriots from the US for Ukraine. Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, discussed the offer with Mr Trump on the phone on Friday, a government spokesman said.\n\nThank you for following our live coverage. Here’s a round-up of today’s events:\n\nRussia launched its largest-ever bombardment of Ukraine\n\nIt came hours after Trump lamented a ‘disappointing’ phone call with Putin\n\nThe Kremlin vowed to continue the war and brushed off peace talks\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchanged more POWs\n\nDowning Street said Putin is not serious about peace\n\nGermany offered to buy Ukraine Patriot missiles after US paused shipments\n\nZelensky and Trump agreed to ‘strengthen’ Kyiv’s air defences\n\nIt was revealed that child casualties in Ukraine have increased threefold\n\nA Russian missile and drone strike on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Thursday damaged the Chinese consulate, according to reports.\n\nHours later, Ukraine said it found a Chinese component inside a Russian drone that hit Kyiv.\n\n“Following tonight’s massive Russian air attack on Ukraine, we discovered in Kyiv a component of a Russian-Iranian Shahed-136\/Geran-2 combat drone, which was made in China and supplied just recently,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, wrote on X.\n\n“And right on the eve, the Chinese Consulate General’s building in Odesa suffered minor damage,” he added.\n\nBeijing has always dismissed claims that it helps supply lethal weapons to its ally, however Western intelligence agencies say China supplies components of weapons, including electronics needed for drones.\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nRussia destroyed the power line that connects the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the power grid, Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko has said.\n\n“The enemy struck the power line connecting the temporarily occupied (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant) with the integrated power system of Ukraine,” he said on Friday.\n\nJust before, the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed that all external power lines supplying electricity to the Russian-occupied plant in Ukraine were down.\n\n“Ukraine’s ZNPP lost all off-site power at 17:36 today, 9th time during military conflict and first since late 2023,” the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on X.\n\nEurope’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is not operating but still requires power to keep its nuclear fuel cool, has switched to running on diesel generators, the IAEA said.\n\nThe IAEA has repeatedly warned of the risk of a catastrophic accident at Zaporizhzhia, which is located near the front line in the war in Ukraine.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed his country’s offer to buy Patriot air defence systems for Ukraine with Donald Trump by phone on Thursday.\n\nMr Merz initiated the call with Trump to promote arms deliveries to Ukraine, particularly Patriots, after the Pentagon paused some shipments, a government spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nGermany was in “intensive talks” to buy Patriots for Ukraine to help it counter some of the heaviest Russian attacks since the war began in 2022, a spokesman said earlier today.\n\n“There are various ways to fill this Patriot gap,” they said, adding that one option being considered was buying the Patriot missile batteries in the US and then sending them on to Kyiv.\n\nWashington has paused shipments of certain critical weapons to Ukraine including 30 Patriot air defence missiles due to low stockpiles, prompting warnings by Kyiv this would weaken its ability to defend itself.\n\nVladimir Putin fired 550 drones and missiles at Ukraine in a new record attack hours after Donald Trump lamented their “disappointing” phone call.\n\nKyiv was the main focus of Russia’s overnight bombardment, which left one dead and 23 injured in the capital, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.\n\n“Absolutely horrible and sleepless night in Kyiv. One of the worst so far. Hundreds of Russian drones and ballistic missiles rained down on the Ukrainian capital. Right after Putin spoke with President Trump,” Andrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, said Russia would not “change its dumb, destructive behaviour” without increasing pressure, particularly from the US.\n\nThe attack, which broke a record set only last weekend, came hours after Mr Trump spoke with Putin, a phone call the US president described as “disappointing”.\n\n“I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there,” he told reporters. “I’m just saying I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”\n\nKremlin aide Yuri Ushakov claimed Putin and Mr Trump were “on the same page”. The US president disagreed: “I didn’t make any progress with him at all.”\n\nMark Rutte, head of Nato, said on Friday that he understands Washington’s need to maintain its own weapons stockpiles, but added he hopes for flexibility to ensure Ukraine continues receiving necessary military support.\n\n“I totally understand for the US to make sure that the stockpiles are at a level that we have the collective defense we need,” Mr Rutte told reporters after a change-of-command ceremony that saw US Air Force General Alexus Grynkewich take over as Nato’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\n\nBut “we all hope for a level of flexibility to make sure that also Ukraine has what it needs,” he added.\n\nUkrainian POWs are seen crying and kissing the floor in footage taken after they were released from captivity as part of the latest prisoner swap with Russia.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump have agreed to work together to “strengthen” Ukraine’s air defences after Kyiv came under a record bombardment.\n\nVladimir Putin ordered his forces to pummel Ukraine’s capital after a phone call with Mr Trump on Thursday night that the US president described as “disappointing”.\n\nMr Zelensky said he spoke with Mr Trump on Friday and the two agreed to “strengthen protection of our skies”. Details of the agreement are not yet clear, but the Ukrainian president suggested they discussed joint production of key air defence systems.\n\nMr Trump’s administration paused some shipments of weapons to Ukraine earlier this week, sparking warnings by Kyiv that the move would weaken its ability to defend against Russia’s intensifying airstrikes and battlefield advances.\n\nGermany’s chancellor also spoke with Mr Trump on Thursday. Friedrich Merz said he discussed buying US-made Patriot air defence systems to bridge the gap.\n\nDonald Trump has spoken with Volodymyr Zelensky, according to reports.\n\nIt was a “good conversation”, said a source familiar with the details, cited by an Axios reporter.\n\nTheir phone call follows Mr Trump complaining he was “disappointed” with the conversation he had with Vladimir Putin last night, which the president said “didn’t make any progress” towards peace.\n\nThe US is not facing a shortage of weapons despite that being used as a reason to pause aid shipments to Ukraine, an American official has said.\n\nAdam Smith, a leading Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said the Pentagon’s justification for pausing weapons deliveries was disingenuous.\n\n“We are not at any lower point, stockpile-wise, than we’ve been in the 3½ years of the Ukraine conflict,” he told NBC News.\n\nThe news outlet also reported that Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defence, took the decision alone, the third such time he had stopped shipments of aid to Ukraine without consulting other departments.\n\nIn the other cases, which took place in February and May, the weapons shipments were resumed.\n\nGermany is in talks on buying Patriot air defence systems for Ukraine to help it counter some of the heaviest Russian attacks since the war began, Berlin has said.\n\nWashington has paused shipments of certain critical weapons to Ukraine, including 30 Patriot air defence missiles, prompting warnings by Kyiv this would weaken its ability to defend itself.\n\n“There are various ways to fill this Patriot gap,” a government spokesperson told a news conference in Berlin, adding that one option being considered is buying  Patriot missile batteries from the US and then sending them on to Kyiv.\n\n“I can confirm that intensive discussions are indeed being held on this matter,” he said.\n\nSteve Witkoff, a senior negotiator in the Trump administration, is pushing for energy sanctions to be lifted on Russia, according to reports.\n\nPolitico reported that Moscow was in early talks with Washington about restarting the Nord Stream pipeline project, which has worried some officials in Brussels.\n\nOther Trump officials disagree, however, including Doug Burgum - the interior secretary - who has pushed to reduce reliance on Russian imports.\n\nEmmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer will co-chair a summit to discuss boosting Ukraine’s defences on July 10 in the United Kingdom, the Elysee Palace has said.\n\n“There will certainly be a discussion on how to seriously maintain Ukraine’s combat capability,” the Elysee Palace said, adding that the two leaders will co-chair the meeting of Kyiv’s allies by video link.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry said its forces successfully carried out strikes against military targets in Kyiv overnight.\n\nIt said high-precision long-range weapons along with hypersonic missiles and drones were used in the onslaught which injured over a dozen in the capital.\n\nUkraine said Russia launched at least 550 drones and missiles, making it the largest aerial attack of the war so far. In recent weeks, Moscow has repeatedly set new records in the size of its bombardments.\n\nA few weeks ago, I met with Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko in his office in the capital. Just 24 hours earlier, Russia had launched one of its biggest bombardments on the capital of the entire war.\n\nThat superlative - be it ‘biggest’, ‘largest’, or ‘longest’ - recurs with chilling regularity in the Ukrainian capital these days, with Moscow’s vastly stepped up production lines now able to send hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles every few nights.\n\nA year ago, around 300 drones were fired at Ukraine per month. The figure is now above 5,000. And the consequences can be in the palls of smoke and burning buildings that Kyiv’s residents wake-up to, often after long nights in bomb shelters.\n\nMr Klitschko was insistent on a single point. Ukraine needed the US to provide more defensive weapons to protect the city, including Patriot munitions for the air defence batteries that guard against ballistic missiles.\n\nThe answer has been a resounding disappointment. While Donald Trump mused about providing more Patriot ammunition during the Nato summit at the Hague, the Pentagon has instead halted supplies of weaponry destined for Ukraine.\n\nSo Kyiv burns, increasingly unaided. European nations are trying to step into the breach, but the question hangs in the air: what will the Ukrainian capital look like, if nights like last one continue at this punishing rate for a month - for a year - or for longer?\n\nRussia’s record strikes on Kyiv shows Vladimir Putin is “not serious” about securing a peace deal, Downing Street has said.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “Continued Russian strikes are clear evidence that Putin is not serious about peace.\n\n“Since Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire over four months ago 700 civilians have been killed, more than 3,000 injured.\n\n“We are, alongside our allies, absolutely united in support of a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. We are clear that must start with a full immediate and unconditional ceasefire.\n\n“But Putin has shown he is not serious about peace.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has had it with Vladimir Putin. After a nearly one-hour phone call with his Russian counterpart, Trump expressed disappointment with Putin’s obstinate continuation of the Ukraine War and admitted: “I didn’t make any progress with him at all.”\n\nThe Kremlin rushed to calm the waters and claimed that Russia was still interested in peace negotiations with Ukraine. Nonetheless, Putin’s aide Yury Ushakov still emphasised the contrast between Trump’s push for a swift ceasefire in Ukraine and the Kremlin’s desire to eliminate the root causes of the Ukraine War.\n\nRussia’s latest actions suggest that Trump’s frustrations are warranted. During the early hours of Friday morning, Russian forces pummelled Ukraine with 550 Shahed drones and ballistic missiles. This attack was Russia’s largest aerial assault of the war, and broke the record set earlier this week of 537 drones and missiles.\n\nEven though Russia has not taken much-feared apocalyptic steps like using tactical nuclear weapons or triggering a meltdown in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, it is steadily escalating its war against Ukrainian civilians.\n\nThe Kremlin has vowed to continue its war against Ukraine, saying it is “not possible” to achieve its aims through “diplomatic means”.\n\n“We are interested in achieving our goals in the course of the special military operation and it is preferable to do it by political and diplomatic means,” a Kremlin spokesman told reporters after being asked about US efforts to push for peace.\n\n“But until that is not possible, we are continuing the special operation.”\n\nThe number of children killed or injured in Ukraine has surged by 200 per cent in the past three months, the latest UN-verified data has found, writes Lilia Sebouai.\n\nAt least 222 children were killed or injured between March and May, compared to 73 from December to February, according to the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission to Ukraine.\n\n“The situation for children is at a critical juncture, “ said Regina De Dominicis, Unicef’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia, adding that “there is no respite from the war for children across Ukraine.”\n\nThe UN said use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas has been “particularly deadly and destructive”.\n\nIt comes as Russia has stepped up its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities. Kyiv was on Friday struck by a wave of overnight drones and missile attacks in the largest aerial assault since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchanged another batch of prisoners of war on Friday.\n\nThe warring sides have exchanged prisoners several times - the latest on June 26 - as part of an agreement struck in Istanbul last month.\n\nRussia is frequently firing a record number of missiles and drones at Ukraine, targeting major cities such as Kyiv and Dnipro.\n\nMoscow fired 550 drones and missiles overnight, breaking a record set only last weekend when 537 aerial weapons were fired across the country.\n\nVladimir Putin told Donald Trump he expected Russia to agree to a date for a third round of peace talks with Ukraine, the Kremlin has said.\n\nThe two sides met for direct talks in May and June, though they came no close to any substantial agreement beyond exchanging prisoners and repatriating the dead.\n\nThe Kremlin said it followed “all statements” by Mr Trump, who expressed his “disappointment” with Putin after their phone call on Thursday.\n\nRepublicans are urging Donald Trump to ramp up pressure on Vladimir Putin to come to the negotiating table and end the war in Ukraine.\n\nDon Bacon, the Congressman for Nebraska’s 2nd District, said Putin had mocked the US president and America by launching another record attack on Ukraine overnight - hours after the two leaders spoke on the phone.\n\n“Mr President, your policy towards Russia is not working. While we negotiate, Putin bombs Ukrainian cities,” Mr Bacon said.\n\n“It is time to change strategy. We and our allies must arm Ukraine to the teeth & we need the toughest sanctions. Putin is mocking you and America.”\n\nJoe Wilson, a Congressman in South Carolina, said Putin had resorted to “scorched earth tactics” across Ukraine just as “Americans begin to enjoy the sounds of fireworks in celebration of our Nation’s Independence”.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump will speak later this afternoon, a Ukrainian official has confirmed to AFP.\n\nThe call follows a conversation between the US president and Vladimir Putin on Thursday.\n\nRussia has increased its use of chemical weapons in Ukraine, Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency said on Friday, citing evidence it obtained alongside its Dutch counterparts.\n\nRussia uses not only tear gas, but also “the more dangerous chemical chloropicrin, which can be lethal in high concentrations in enclosed spaces” in Ukraine, the BND said in a statement.\n\n“This represents a more serious violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of this lung warfare agent under all circumstances,” it said.\n\nThe defence minister and chief of military intelligence in the Netherlands told Reuters.\n\nThe Polish embassy was damaged during a Russian attack on Kyiv, Poland’s foreign minister has said.\n\n“In a massive (Russian) attack on Kyiv, the building of our embassy’s consular section was damaged,” Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X.\n\n“I just spoke with Ambassador Lukasiewicz; everyone is safe and sound. Ukraine urgently needs air defence resources.”\n\nThe extent to which the US has suspended weapons deliveries to Ukraine remains unclear.\n\nTammy Bruce, a State Department spokesperson, said the US “hasn’t paused” sending weapons to Ukraine but that the recent suspension is “one aspect, one situation, one event that has been changed”.\n\nBut  Sean Parnell, a senior Pentagon spokesperson, said the defence department had “paused” weapons to Ukraine in order to conduct a “capability review”.\n\nMr Trump, meanwhile, said last night not all weapons shipments had been paused.\n\n“We’re giving weapons, but we’ve given so many weapons. But we are giving weapons. And we’re working with them and trying to help them, but we haven’t,” he said.\n\n“You know, Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.”\n\nChina cannot afford for Russia to lose the war in Ukraine, its foreign minister has said, in unguarded comments to European officials.\n\nWang Yi, China’s foreign minister, said Beijing does not want to see a Russian loss because of fears the United States would then shift its focus on to China.\n\nThe comments were made during a four-hour meeting between Mr Wang and Kaja Kallas, the vice-president of the European Commission, according to several sources who spoke to the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe remarks took many by surprise as Chinese officials do not often speak this candidly, even in closed-door meetings.\n\nAccording to those familiar with the conversation, Mr Wang also gave Ms Kallas several “history lessons and lectures” about realpolitik and concerns in Beijing that Washington will gradually turn its attention east.\n\nDonald Trump said he was “disappointed” by a phone call with Vladimir Putin after the pair spoke for less than an hour on Thursday.\n\n“I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there,” he told reporters. “I’m just saying I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has said last night’s record attack on Ukraine shows Russia has no intention to change its “dumb, destructive behaviour”.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said Kyiv had suffered a “brutal, sleepless” night after hundreds of Iranian-made Shahed drones were fired at the country.\n\n“All of this is clear evidence that without truly large-scale pressure, Russia will not change its dumb, destructive behaviour,” he wrote on X.\n\nMr Zelensky also called on Ukraine’s partners - including the US - to increase pressure on Russia to end the war.\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nUkraine’s foreign minister said Kyiv had suffered “one of the worst nights” of the war so far after Russia fired hundreds of drones and ballistic missiles at the capital overnight.\n\n“Right after Putin spoke with President Trump. And he does it on purpose. Enough of waiting!” Andrii Sybiha said.\n\n“Putin clearly shows his complete disregard for the United States and everyone who has called for an end to the war.”\n\nRussia launched yet another record attack on Ukraine overnight, firing 539 drones and 11 ballistic and cruise missiles, the Ukrainian air force has said.\n\nRussia hit Kyiv with drones in an all-night attack, injuring at least 23 people, damaging railway infrastructure and setting buildings and cars on fire throughout the city, Ukrainian authorities said this morning.\n\n“The main target of the strikes was the capital of Ukraine, the city of Kyiv!” the Air Force said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nIt breaks a record set by Russia on Saturday, when 537 drones and missiles were launched at Ukraine.\n\nGood morning and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.\n\nWe’ll bring you the the latest news and analysis throughout the day.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"VIENNA (Reuters) -All external power lines supplying electricity to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine were down for several hours on Friday, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said, but the station's management later said power had been restored.\n\nThe head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, acknowledged that power had been restored after 3 1\/2 hours. But he added in a statement on X that nuclear safety \"remains extremely precarious in Ukraine.\"\n\nUkraine's energy minister blamed Russian shelling for severing the last power line to the plant and its six reactors. The country's power distribution operator said its technicians had taken action to restore it.\n\nEurope's biggest nuclear power plant, which is not operating but still requires power to keep its nuclear fuel cool, switched during the outage to running on diesel generators, the IAEA said.\n\nThe organization has repeatedly warned of the risk of a catastrophic accident at Zaporizhzhia, which is located near the front line in the war in Ukraine.

We would chastise Israel for doing that. We would threaten to withhold arms deliveries,” he continues. “But instead, we joined it.”\n\nLivermore says that one thing the U.S. has “historically sucked at” in recent years is “going to war with a half-baked plan\" and \"without clear, definable objectives.”\n\n“So as we start to look now, I know that there's a lot of consternation that as this Trump administration started to make the case for bombing Iran and escalating…there was certainly a concern that like, maybe history doesn’t repeat itself, but perhaps it was starting to rhyme a little bit,\" Livermore adds.\n\n“Given some of the disastrous foreign policy experiences we've had going all the way back to 2001, I can understand why the American people are naturally suspicious of anything that starts to look a little bit too much like an administration making a case to go to war,” he continues.\n\nAlthough he understands why many Americans “are naturally suspicious,” he doesn't believe that \"this administration has any interest in escalating,” he says.\n\nThe Special Forces officer agrees: “I haven't heard any serious person in government or otherwise saying that regime change would mean like the U.S. invading Iran.”\n\nCourtesy of Doug Livermore\n\nWith a 20-year military career under his belt, the officer says he feels conflicting emotions about his service.\n\n“You'll never have more impact on people, good and bad, than you do when you're deployed,” he says. “It just demands the most of you, and you get to really see what you're made of.”\n\nBut there are hidden costs, too.\n\n“For my first deployment, I wasn't married, but for all my subsequent ones, I was married with children,” he explains, noting that for the first five or six years of his eldest child’s life, he was either deployed or away for training.\n\n“I've been more present for my younger daughters,” he says, “and I can see the difference in my connection with them.”\n\nHis service also had an impact on his wife, one he wasn’t fully aware of until he came back home for long enough to really talk about it.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories\n\nIn addition to the cost on family, there’s a personal toll that encompasses physical as well as moral injuries.\n\n“At the end of the day, you're beholden to these political objectives, and those can change, and if they do and you disagree with them, well, you have to do them anyway, and that could have an impact on you,” he adds.\n\nLivermore, now a dad of 3, says part of the reason why he left duty was his children — the youngest of whom have no “real” memory of that part of his life.\n\n“Actually, my 13 year old was doing the history project and 9\/11 came up,” he says.\n\nLivermore, who was then still a sophomore at West Point, says he told her that day defined “the next 20 plus years of our lives.”\n\nCourtesy of Doug Livermore\n\nLivermore stresses that it's \"too easy to get caught up in the dead, the wounded, the dollars and cents of equipment destroyed.\"\n\n“Those are the very, very immediate costs that everybody can appreciate. They're measurable,\" he says, but there’s also countless lives that have been shattered by PTSD or substance abuse caused by \"self-medication due to wounds, either seen or unseen.”\n\n\"These are the things that Americans are not necessarily thinking about when they start talking about whether or not to go to war,\" he adds. \"And not to get too philosophical about it, but you go back to Eisenhower's speech on the military industrial complex. Every rocket built, every tank, every ship is a school, a hospital. Take your pick of something for society that's not going to get built.\"\n\n\"Being at a much at a different phase in my life than I was at the beginning,\" he adds, \"I wish we had taken some more time, particularly in 2003, and stopped and questioned and had some very honest conversations about what it was that we were actually thinking about getting involved in, because we really had no idea.

    "News_text":"Iran is quietly resuming indirect nuclear talks with the US despite strong opposition from hardliners, The Telegraph can reveal.\n\nTehran’s supreme national security council told the foreign ministry to reopen talks with the Trump administration, aiming to revive diplomacy after a12-day war with Israellast month that saw the US bomb key Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTehran and Washington heldfive rounds of talks from April 12. The sixth round was cancelled after Israel launched strikes on Iran on June 13.\n\nA senior Iranian official who spoke to The Telegraph from Tehran said: “The supreme national security council has told the foreign ministry to resume negotiating with America to persuade Trump that Israel was wrong to strike Iran.”\n\n“The other goal is to stop the reimposition of UN sanctions before it’s too late,” the official added, referring to a provision in the 2015 nuclear deal that would see sanctions automatically come into effect on Oct 18 if Iran breaches its nuclear commitments.\n\nIt came after reports emerged thatSteve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s envoy, was due to travel to Oslo next week to restart nuclear talks with Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister.\n\nMr Araghchi wrote in a Lebanese newspaper this week: “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s acceptance of the request to stop the war has created another opportunity for comprehensive diplomacy.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, was aware of the renewed talks. He has not been seen in public since before the start of hostilities with Israel, which ended in afragile ceasefire brokered by Donald Trump.\n\nKhamenei holds ultimate authority over Iran’s political, military and ideological matters, including foreign policy and national security. The president and parliament operate under his influence.\n\nThe disappearance has fuelled speculation about his health, whereabouts and the stability of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Iranian official who spoke to the Telegraph said the new talks are expected to take place quietly, without publicity, due to strong opposition from hardliners in Tehran.\n\nSepehr Khalaji, who was a senior official in the administration offormer Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi, has warned officials against engaging in any talks with the United States.\n\nKhalaji said Tehran should avoid dialogue with Washington after “America martyred 1,000 of your citizens, struck our nuclear facilities, violated our airspace, took our commanders and scientists, and threatened our supreme and beloved leader”.\n\nTheIranian regime celebrated the end of the war as a “victory”, however this unity has quickly descended into disagreements between hardliners and moderates over the country’s future.\n\nHardliners believe they have a chance to bring the country together and show the West’s weakness, while moderates say the the regime should be open to dialogue.\n\nUnder hardline influence, Iran’s parliament has banned International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from entering sensitive nuclear sites. These included Fordow, whichIranian officials confirmed was “seriously and extensively” damagedduring the US attack.\n\nThe last UN nuclear inspector left Tehran on Friday morning.\n\nIran has intensified its long-standing criticism of the IAEA, with some lawmakers and regime-affiliated mediaissuing death threats against Rafael Grossi, its director general.\n\nThe agency has confirmed that its inspectors have now left Iran, which means the regime could continue its nuclear work without international oversight.\n\nModerate officials in Tehran are however reportedly urging the Khamenei to engage with the West.\n\nConcerned about the potential for further conflict, former president Hassan Rouhani has asked top clerics to help push for a change in the establishment’s position.\n\nHe warned that if the crisis continues, the Islamic Republic could collapse and the role of the clergy could weaken.\n\nAli Larijani, the former parliament speaker, has also reportedly tried to use his influence and family ties to convince Khamenei to allow talks with the US.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Voices from the Arab press: When the ceasefire prolongs the war",
    "News_text":"A weekly selection of opinions and analyses from the Arab media around the world.\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat, London, June 27\n\nAccording to an old saying, the history of any war is written by the victor. This is because the loser is either dead, too wounded to write, or, in some cases, eager to turn the victor into a friend. But for that saying to hold true, the war must conclude with a recognized victor. That presents another problem: no one can crown themselves triumphant and place a laurel on their head unless their opponent formally admits defeat.\n\nThis is the dilemma Israel has faced ever since it fought to secure its small place on the map. Each time it won a war, it was forced to accept ceasefires imposed by its friends. This time, too, it was the US – yet again – that robbed it of the spoils of victory. The do-gooders who forced a “conflicting” final outcome forgot that the purpose of war is to disrupt an unstable status quo and replace it with a new one acceptable to the warring parties, by defining clearly who prevailed and who was defeated.\n\nWar, as the saying goes, is politics by other means. But here, world powers have turned war into a deceitful form of diplomacy, resembling a game of snakes and ladders. Some foreign leaders profited from meddling, winning elections, or even receiving the faintly absurd Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSince 1947, dozens of new states have emerged on the map, and dozens of wars have erupted, with winners and losers alike, establishing a new reality that has secured long periods of peace and stability. In all those cases, war, which Aristotle considered among humanity’s noblest endeavors, served as the means to determine who won and who lost. The purpose of war is to slice through the Gordian knot with a single stroke and then let things return to their natural course. As for the advocates of ceasefires, they turn war into a knife left inside the wound, to be twisted again and again.\n\nIn some cases, a ceasefire can be the enemy of peace. That could be the case with the ceasefire ordered by US President Donald Trump between Israel and Iran, which temporarily froze a conflict that had simmered for nearly half a century since Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, made it his mission to eliminate the “Zionist entity.”\n\nBy any military measure, Israel achieved a sweeping victory in the12-day warthat Trump halted. It seized control of Iranian airspace within 48 hours, paving the way for US B-2 bombers to wipe out Iran’s core nuclear facilities within hours, meeting no resistance. Israel also decapitated the Iranian military leadership dominated by the Revolutionary Guards, destroying the Quds Force’s headquarters that had long coordinated Iran’s operations in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and Yemen.\n\nACCORDING TO Iranian estimates, Israel damaged or destroyed the Islamic Republic’s military and nuclear infrastructure by hitting over 600 targets, inflicting more than $1.8 trillion in damage. In a classic display of military precision, Israel struck targets in 20 of Iran’s 31 provinces without losing a single warplane.\n\nFatemeh Mohajerani, spokesperson for President Masoud Pezeshkian, claimed the Israeli attacks killed over 600 people, including 54 women and children. Among the dead were 23 generals with one or two stars, along with 300 other military personnel, including noncommissioned officers. Forty-six Iranian nuclear scientists were also killed, while 4,746 Iranians were wounded. On the Israeli side, Iranian retaliatory strikes killed more than 30 people, among them an 18-year-old conscript, and left 3,238 wounded.\n\nOrdinarily, this would have made Israel the clear victor in the 12-day war. However, as before, it is labeled the loser by Iran and, even more disturbingly, by certain self-proclaimed experts in the US and Europe. To further complicate matters, President Trump cast himself as the victor who ended the war by “eliminating Iran’s nuclear program forever” and securing a ceasefire within 24 hours.\n\nIran tried to outbid Trump in claiming victory. “We broke the American bull’s horns and rubbed its nose in the dirt,” said Mohammad Reza Aref, the first vice president of Iran. Tehran’s propaganda machinery seized on the fact that the war lasted 12 days. An editorial on Tasnim News, tied to the Revolutionary Guards, bragged: “The Arabs, led by Egypt, collapsed after six days against the Zionists in 1967. But the Islamic Republic withstood the Zionists and their American backers for 12 days, forcing them to beg for a ceasefire.”\n\nIran’s official media quotedThe New York Times, CNN, and other Western networks questioning Trump’s and Israel’s declarations of victory. Iranian outlets showcased prominent Western voices backing Iran’s narrative, among them John Mearsheimer, David Attenborough, Noam Chomsky, and Jeffrey Sachs.\n\nIran’s claims of triumph have emboldened Khomeinist hardliners to prepare for another round of fighting. “We have defeated the Great Satan and his Zionist agent,” proclaimed Gen. Ebrahim Jabbari, a one-star general. “But we must not stop there. We must keep our boot on Netanyahu’s neck until he chokes.”\n\nOnce again in Middle Eastern history, a ceasefire dictated by short-term political calculations is set to prolong a conflict that has raged for decades, with each new phase bloodier than the one before. –Amir Taheri\n\nAl Rai, Kuwait, June 28\n\nAll that truly happened was thatPresident Donald Trumpemerged, at least on the surface, as the victor from the Iranian-Israeli confrontation, having capitalized on Iran’s urgent need for a ceasefire in a war during which he had initially floated the idea of regime change before pulling back. Will Iran accept Trump’s statements that he does not seek regime change – along with its own missile strike on the Al Udeid base in Qatar – as enough to claim that it overcame its war with Israel and emerged victorious?\n\nIran is positioning itself as triumphant despite the heavy losses it suffered, and despite having been compelled to abandon its nuclear ambitions, its ballistic missile program, and its network of regional proxies such as Hezbollah. Preserving the regime itself became Iran’s overriding priority after Israel succeeded in taking the war directly into Iranian territory, assassinating a significant number of military leaders and nuclear scientists, and exposing the deep vulnerabilities of the Iranian regime.\n\nOne telling sign of the weakness of the Islamic Republic was the language its officials used throughout the conflict, appealing to international law and highlighting their supposed commitment to legal principles. Suddenly, the Islamic Republic remembered international law, conveniently forgetting its long record of promoting its regional ambitions through assassinations, violence, coercion, and sectarian incitement.\n\nOne need only look at its domination of Lebanon, a project that began more than 43 years ago with the Revolutionary Guard’s first deployment to a Lebanese army barracks, the Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek. The Lebanese experience illustrates the broader collapse of Iran’s expansionist strategy, which effectively unraveled with Bashar al-Assad’s flight from Damascus on December 8, 2024.\n\nFor decades, Iran had pursued its goals in Lebanon, often under Syrian cover, with tireless determination and the tacit acceptance of Israel, which itself is hardly a model of respect for international law. Iranian influence in Lebanon culminated in the 2023 war in support of Gaza, through which Tehran demonstrated that it ultimately controlled the Lebanese state’s decision-making power via Hezbollah.\n\nIRAN’S SUDDEN rhetorical embrace of international law and the UN Charter is deeply ironic, given that since the 1979 overthrow of the shah, the Islamic Republic has repeatedly shown contempt for these very norms, most memorably during the 444-day hostage crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran beginning in November 1979. It is hardly necessary to look far to see that Iran has never truly respected international law but instead followed its own rules, exploiting America’s periodic willingness to treat Iran as a useful boogeyman for pressuring Gulf states into viewing the US as their only protector.\n\nThis dynamic, marketed under the slogan of “exporting the revolution,” has played out for decades. It is useful, even today, to remember Iran’s activities in Lebanon from the very first days, including the kidnapping of David Dodge, the president of the American University of Beirut, who was eventually released from Tehran after being routed through Syria.\n\nSuccessive American administrations have too often remained silent about Iran’s outrages. In the 1980s, they stayed silent about the kidnappings of Americans such as CIA station chief William Buckley and Col. William Higgins, who was working with the UN’s international observer mission in southern Lebanon.\n\nUS administrations likewise ignored Hezbollah’s violence, which ultimately prompted the withdrawal of US forces from Lebanon after the bombing of the US Embassy in Beirut and the suicide attack on the Marine barracks near Beirut airport on October 23, 1983.\n\nNowhere in Iran’s regional record does respect for international law appear – unless one truly believes that the assassination of Rafic Hariri and his companions on February 14, 2005, was carried out in accordance with the UN Charter on Human Rights. That killing was designed to crush the only serious attempt to revive Beirut and Lebanon after decades of civil war, which began with the conflicts of April 13, 1975. This is precisely what President Joseph Aoun should have noted, instead of ignoring it, during the celebration of lighting up Martyrs’ Square and Nejmeh Square.\n\nTheoretically, the Israeli-Iranian war has stopped. The direct American intervention on Israel’s behalf during this conflict will stand as one of its most consequential chapters since hostilities erupted on June 13, 2025.\n\nHowever, the cessation of open warfare does not mean the challenges facing the Iranian regime have vanished. Those challenges persist, despite the collapse of its regional expansionist project, the uncertainty now surrounding the regime’s own survival, and the demonstrated ability of Israel to penetrate both Iran’s security services and its society at large.\n\nUltimately, the Iranian regime, in its current shape, is viable without the engine of regional expansionism, no matter how many victory celebrations are staged to suggest otherwise. –Kheirallah Kheirallah\n\nAl-Ittihad, UAE, June 28\n\nIt is too early to confirm that Israeli society has fully accepted the results of the recent confrontation with Iran, or that what was achieved represents a historic victory, as Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu is currently promoting.\n\nThe fragile national consensus that emerged may persist for several reasons, chief among them the continued presence of the Iranian threat regardless of the confrontation that took place. This issue will provoke intense disagreement within the government and across the political and military establishment in the coming period, especially as the war on Gaza resumes.\n\nWhat occurred with Iran could well repeat itself in Gaza, while the current situation might be exploited politically and strategically to pursue a long-term truce. All parties involved in managing the Gaza conflict know that the matter is in the hands of President Trump, who, if he chooses, could replicate what he did between Iran and Israel rather than allowing the process to slip back into a vicious cycle of pointless negotiations.\n\nWithin this context, the stability of the government itself may need to be reassessed, based on the fact that – contrary to some perceptions – Netanyahu’s government is not in a political deadlock, neither domestically, thanks to a relatively solid majority in the Knesset, nor internationally, especially given support from the US and major European powers, which reached its peak when the US joined the war effort and then pressed for a ceasefire under Trump’s influence.\n\nAlthough the Netanyahu government continues to hold a clear parliamentary majority – officially resting on 65 out of 120 seats – in practice, its backing is closer to 69 members of parliament. These dynamics were reflected in two recent polls, by Channel 13 andMaariv, which showed the Likud party gaining around four seats compared to surveys conducted before the conflict.\n\nThe point is that despite the appearance of broad political consensus and a near-popular alignment, certain reservations have arisen about the timing of the war, its results, and Israel’s ability to achieve its stated objectives of completely dismantling Iran’s nuclear program or toppling the Iranian regime. The military establishment will continue to play a decisive role on these matters, especially given recent shifts within the army’s leadership and intelligence circles, and considering the scale of the recent confrontation with Iran.\n\nIt is expected that the current governing coalition will continue a policy of preserving unnecessary ministries, advancing the tax evasion law, alienating the ultra-Orthodox from military service and broader Israeli society, supporting education budgets for the ultra-Orthodox who do not participate in the liberal state education system, ignoring the high cost of living, and avoiding structural reforms that do not support sustained economic growth – trends that could once again deepen societal divides and return Israel to the state it was in before the Iran clash.\n\nThis concern has already driven the Knesset to raise the defense budget by NIS 3.6 billion [$1.1b.] for 2025, an increase that includes NIS 699 million [$208m.] to fund food shipments to Gaza residents and NIS 2.953 billion [$877.4 million] to cover expanded military costs from the resumption of the war on Gaza.\n\nOne can stress that Israel’s political future will depend on the degree to which the public accepts the outcome of the present circumstances and on whether the Hezbollah-Israel agreement and the Iran-Israel agreement can hold up over the medium term.\n\nAdded to this are the massive losses the government will be forced to absorb, which public opinion will bear and the opposition will spotlight among voters, constantly repeating warnings about the persistent Iranian threat in the region, particularly with its ongoing missile and nuclear program. This is likely to become a central argument for the opposition and fuel continued tensions over Israel’s national priorities, which in turn could lead to more fragmentation.\n\nHerein lies the danger to the broader political stability that Netanyahu claims, even as he seeks to highlight Israel’s successive victories and the supposed total neutralization of the Iranian threat, despite the severe costs to the Israeli home front. Overall, disagreements will inevitably surface between political and military leaders about the post-conflict phase with Iran and the renewed war with Hamas, which may expose the realities of many details previously kept under wraps.\n\nNetanyahu will remain a dominant figure in politics and party circles, maneuvering skillfully and emphasizing the strategic options he still has to counter for those calling for early elections, in light of Israel’s ongoing existential threats and the reality that the confrontation with Iran has not truly ended – an argument his supporters may well accept as the opposition struggles to present a coherent, workable alternative. –Tarek Fahmy\n\nAl-Masry Al-Youm, Egypt, June 28\n\nNow that thewar between Iran and Israelhas ended, a common question echoes among Israelis and Iranians alike: who emerged as the victor, and who the loser? The acceptance of a ceasefire after 12 days of fierce fighting between Iran on one side and Israel and the US on the other followed a series of public and back-channel negotiations, culminating in US President Donald Trump announcing a ceasefire, claiming the US had achieved its objective of destroying Iran’s nuclear capacity.\n\nThis was soon followed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu declaring that Israel had removed what he described as an existential nuclear threat, celebrating what he framed as a historic victory over Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian proclaimed the war’s end after what he hailed as a heroic resistance, affirming Iran’s victory thanks to the steadfastness and sacrifice of its people. Thus, all three parties emerged to declare victory. But who, in reality, won, and who lost?\n\nEarly assessments suggest that Israel initiated the conflict and successfully dismantled Iran’s air defense network, completely disabling the Iranian air force and leaving its skies open to Israeli aircraft, which launched what were described as “painful” and “effective” strikes on military targets, nuclear facilities, oil infrastructure, and Iranian leaders and scientists. Afterward, the US intervened with devastating airstrikes on the three most important nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with President Trump exchanging words of victory with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nOn the Iranian side, Tehran managed to demonstrate its resilience, exposing vulnerabilities in Israel’s multilayered air defenses by striking military installations, research centers, and key economic targets in Haifa, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, and other cities.\n\nPerhaps most symbolically, Iran was able to replicate, even on a smaller scale, the images of destruction long familiar in Gaza, projecting those scenes onto Israeli cities in a way never before seen in Israel’s history. Iran did not allow the US airstrikes to go unanswered, responding with a “coordinated” attack on the American Al Udeid air base in Qatar, an operation that effectively marked the transition toward a ceasefire.\n\nIn my view, what has happened amounts to a fragile pause, with the question of victory or defeat deferred until further notice, pending fresh negotiations between the Iranian and American sides on several critical files, foremost among them Iran’s nuclear program. The second issue will be Iran’s ballistic and multi-warhead missile capabilities, and the third concerns Iranian-backed armed factions, the Palestinian resistance, and Iran’s evolving regional role.\n\nThe manner of the ceasefire declaration provided a convenient face-saving exit for all sides, allowing them to proclaim victory before their domestic audiences. Yet the coming negotiations on these thorny matters will ultimately determine where this conflict heads. There is no doubt Iran’s nuclear program has been heavily damaged, and it will require years to recover.\n\nHowever, the real test lies in the days ahead: will the US, along with its protégé Israel, be content with what has already been accomplished, or will they remain determined to continue reshaping the region to meet Israeli interests, at the center of which is the ambition to change or even overthrow the Iranian regime?\n\nSadly, all the lessons of history point to Israel’s deep-rooted belief in aggression and territorial expansion as fundamental to its doctrine, meaning peace, quiet, and any cessation of war are merely temporary way points, with Israel poised to resume its limitless expansionist aims. Herein lies the true danger. –Abdel-Mohsen Salama\n\nTranslated by Asaf Zilberfarb.

    "News_text":"Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) is pressing the Trump administration to rescind its pause on sending weapons to Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\n“Senior U.S. military officials have concluded that providing these critical weapons to Ukraine will not endanger U.S. readiness, so I urge the administration to quickly get the pipeline back up and running,” McCaul, who previously served as chair of the House Armed Services Committee,wrote Fridayin a post on the social platform X.\n\n“Pentagon officials halting weapons only weakens President Trump’s noble attempts at peace,” he added.\n\nThe Texas lawmaker’s request comes days after the Defense Departmentannounced it would haltthe delivery ofsome air defense missiles and munitionsto the war-torn country, citing concerns around military stockpiles being depleted. That decision, according to the White House, was based on an analysis of the U.S.’s military support around the globe.\n\nThe Biden and Trump administrations have given tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Kyiv since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.\n\nUkraine hawks on Capitol Hillhave criticizedthe Pentagon’s decision, with Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) requestingmore transparencyon the matter.\n\n“I respectfully request an emergency briefing from the White House and the Department of Defense on the Pentagon’s recent review of our nation’s weapons and munitions stockpiles, as well as the decision to withhold urgent, lifesaving military assistance to Ukraine,” Fitzpatrick, wrote Wednesday in aletter to the White House.\n\nPresident Trump told reporters a day later on Air Force One that the U.S. hasgiven too many weaponsto Ukraine and claimed former President Biden “emptied our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.”\n\nTrump, whohas spokenwith both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent days, has worked to broker a ceasefire in the more than three-year war, with little results.\n\nAfter acall with Putinearlier Thursday, the president signaled the U.S. would not completely cut Ukraine off from assistance. He also said he was“very disappointed”by his conversation with the Russian leader, adding, “I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”\n\nLess than a day later, Moscow launched amassive drone attackon Ukraine that hit residential buildings, set cars and ambulances ablaze and left at least one person dead and around two dozen injured, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.\n\nMcCaul, in a separate X post, said the drone attack shows Putin is “a war criminal” and urged his colleagues to pass legislation thatincreases sanctionson Russia.\n\n“Russia’s attack last night on Ukraine makes it clear Putin is nothing more than a war criminal and a thug,” hewrote Friday. “And conducting such a massive strike directly after his call with President Trump is disrespectful to the president’s sincere attempts to bring peace.”\n\n“Now is the time to pass the bipartisan, bicameral Russia sanctions bill and ensure Ukraine has the weapons it needs to defend itself,” he continued. “Putin has made it clear he will only come to the negotiating table once he realizes the cost of his continued bloodshed is too high.”\n\nThe bill,introduced in the upper chamberby Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) would impose primary and secondary sanctions on Russia and additional tariffs on imported goods from any country that buys Russian oil or gas as long as the war continues.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Trump Signs Bill to Kick Millions Off Health Care Into Law",
    "News_text":"The so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” — Donald Trump and the GOP’s sprawling legislative package that will cut taxes on the rich, supercharge the administration’s immigration raids and arrests, and gut green-energy initiatives while kicking millions of Americans off their health care and other social services — is now law.\n\nThe president signed thedevastating legislative packagein a Fourth of July ceremony at the White House.\n\nA slew of preppy-looking accomplices waited for President Trump to make his address while the corniest parade music you could imagine blasted. When Donald and Melania Trump finally took to a balcony for the President’s speech, there was a long, awkward silence before a performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” was muffled by a noisy military flyover. Trumppreviouslyannounced, “We’re going to have B-2s and F-22s and F-35s flying right over the White House… so we’ll be signing with those beautiful planes flying right over our heads.”\n\nTrump then went on to make a litany of hyperbolic claims, taking credit for “the most successful military strike in all of history,Operation Midnight Hammer” and military enlistment being at a “all time-record.” He also claimed “jobs” and the “stock market” are on the rise. In his rambling remarks, Trump relived his electoral victory and attempted to dunk on former President Joe Biden before finally addressing the bill at hand.\n\n“It’s the most popular bill ever signed in the history of our country,” he claimed. “Whether you’re military or anybody else, this is the single most popular bill ever signed.” Still, a variety ofrecent pollscontradict him.\n\nRepublicans in Congresspassed the legislationon Thursday after months of internal hand-wringing. Several members of the party were not comfortable, to say the least, with the $4 trillion the bill is expected to add to the national deficit. Others, like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) made a public show of opposing its cuts to Medicaid, but ultimately caved and supported them. In the end, Republicans were faithful not to the United States, to their constituents, or to any semblance of human dignity — but to Trump. As House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) put it to reporters this week, “All of us have to give up on our personal preferences.”\n\nThe bill Trump signed into law on Friday is actuallyunpopularamong the American public, and for good reason. It will cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the cuts, along with changes to individual health insurance marketplaces, will cause around 17 million people to lose their coverage. The cuts to Medicaid are also expected to wreak havoc on rural hospitals, nursing homes, and more.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) teed off on the cuts during a marathon speech ahead of the bill’s passage on Thursday, sharing stories of Americans who will stand to lose Medicaid coverage because of the bill. “People will die,” he said, calling the House floor where the bill would soon be passed a “crime scene.” In his remarks, Trump mocked Jeffries. “You saw that guy standing up for hours yesterday, didn’t know what he was even doing there,“ he said as he lambasted the Democrats’ advocacy against the bill as a “con job.” “He had a towel. He’s wiping his face. That’s not too elegant.”\n\nThe law also rolls back a litany of Biden-era environmental provisions, dealing a catastrophic blow to the effort tohold polluters accountable; stuffs even more cash into an already bloated Pentagon budget; sends tens of billions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as it carries out the Trump administration’s increasingly cruel deportation agenda; imposes steep cuts on federal food assistance; and gives tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations while makingthe poorest Americans pay more.\n\nAs Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) recently wrote of the bill: “We are watching oligarchy in real time.”\n\nTrump, the oligarch-in-chief, has been crowing about the passage of his legislative agenda all week, writing on Thursday that the “USA is the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, by far!!!” He, of course, continued to tout the bill while signing it into law at the White House on Friday.\n\n“The Golden Age of America is upon us,” Trump bragged. “It’s going to be a period of time the likes of which I don’t think this country has ever experienced before.”\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nTrump's New Go-To Response: 'I Don't Know'\n\nEvery Dirty Gift Trump's Big Bill Gives the Fossil Fuel Industry\n\nMan Afraid to Ride Subway Named Head of NASA\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nThe Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nAnatomy of a Fake News Scandal\n\nThe Radical Crusade of Mike Pence\n\nSign up forRollingStone's Newsletter.

    "News_title":"Trump signs big tax cut and spending bill into law in July Fourth ceremony",
    "News_text":"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law his sweeping tax cut and spending package, what he’s called the “big, beautiful bill,” in a Fourth of July ceremony packed with patriotic pomp and symbolism.\n\nThe White House ceremony, which took place alongside a military picnic, included an armed forces flyover and was attended by jubilant Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, both of Louisiana, who helpedmuscle the legislationthrough their chamber Thursday by a razor-thin margin.\n\n“Our country has had so much to celebrate this Independence Day as we enter our 249th year. America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said before signing the bill.\n\n“We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent. That’s the largest tax cut in the history of our country,” he continued. “We’re setting all sorts of economic records right now, and that’s before this kicks in. After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically.”\n\nThe Senate on Tuesdaypassed the billon a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance needed to break the tie. That sent the bill to the House, which passed it on a mostly party-line vote of 218-214 Thursday, just one day before Trump’s arbitraryJuly Fourth deadline.\n\nAs a band played the national anthem, a B-2 Spirit bomber, accompanied by two F-35 jets, flew over the White House in honor of the U.S. strike on nuclear facilities in Iran last month. The pilots who participated in those strikes, Operation Midnight Hammer, were invited to the event by Trump.\n\nTrump, first lady Melania Trump and their guests were expected to watch the annual Independence Day fireworks celebration over the National Mall on Friday night. The president visited his Virginia golf club earlier in the day.\n\nThe bill signing capped a grueling, monthslong process, during which the House and the Senatepublicly quarreledover whether the GOP should try to pass Trump’s domestic policy priorities in one bill or break them up into two. Moderate and conservative Republicans also battled over how much they should cut federal safety net programs — Medicaid and food aid (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) — as well as how much to raise the deduction cap on state and local taxes, or SALT.\n\nThemammoth packagefulfills many of Trump’s 2024 campaign promises. It extends the expiring tax cuts he enacted in his first term, in 2017, while temporarily slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay and allowing deductions on auto loan interest payments. It also includes hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and on carrying out Trump’s mass deportation plans.\n\nThe legislation partly pays for that with steep cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and clean energy funding.\n\nAnd despite conservative calls to tackle the ballooning debt and deficit, the Trump law is projected to increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO also estimated that 11.8 million people could lose health insurance coverage because of the legislation’s Medicaid cuts and other provisions.\n\nAraft of recent pollsshows Trump’s big bill is deeply unpopular. A recentQuinnipiac University pollfound that 53% of registered voters oppose the bill, while only 27% support it. And Democrats, eager to win back control of the House and possibly the Senate in 2026, are salivating at the chance to make the Trump bill a central campaign issue in the midterm elections.\n\n“Not a single thing in Donald Trump’s one big, ugly bill will meaningfully make life more affordable for everyday Americans, and that’s just one of several reasons why House Democrats are hell no on this legislation,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Thursday in arecord-breaking, nearly nine-hour floor speech.\n\n“We were a hell no last week, a hell no this week, a hell no yesterday, a hell no today,” he said to raucous cheers from Democrats. “And will continue to be a hell no on this effort to hurt the American people.”\n\nJust a day after Congress passed the bill, Republicans have already started talking about making changes to the law. As he touted the tax cuts and spending cuts in the package, Vance on Friday opened the door to changing some of the policies in it.\n\nTrump “makes a reform, he sees how it plays out, and he’s always willing to have a conversation in order to make things even better,” the vice president, who played a key role in House and Senate negotiations this week, told reporters in North Dakota.\n\nAt the White House ceremony, Republicans jostled with each other to be close to Trump for the bill-signing photo opportunity.\n\nAmong the senators on hand were Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho and Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. House members included Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith of Missouri and Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington of Texas.\n\nJohnson presented Trump with a gift at the signing: “This is the gavel used to enact the big, beautiful bill.”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

LL Cool J was set to headline the festival along with Grammy-winning singer Jazmine Sullivan.\n\nHe continued by saying he hoped “the city can make a deal” and that he plans to be in Philadelphia “in case it works out.”\n\nThe union, District Council 33 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, began its strike at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday morning after no new agreement for a higher-paying contract was reached. Union members are responsible for essential public services, such as 911 dispatch and sanitation.\n\nThe union responded to LL Cool J on social media, saying it was encouraging to see him use his influence “to champion causes that matter to everyday people.”\n\n“LL Cool J’s decision to stand in solidarity with the labor movement by choosing not to cross a picket line is a powerful testament to his respect for workers’ rights,” the union said in a statement.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker said she was aware of LL Cool J’s decision to not perform and she had “spoke personally” with him.\n\n“I respect his decision, and understand his desire to see the city unified. He is always welcome in Philadelphia,” she said in a statement.\n\nHours before she was set to perform, Sullivan also announced she was backing out of the festival in solidarity with the union.\n\n“Today I choose to not perform at the Wawa Welcome America concert and stand with Philly’s DC33 until the city and union find a way to bring fair living wages to our working class,” Sullivan wrote on Instagram.\n\nParker confirmed that Sullivan had also decided not to perform, saying, “I respect Jazmine’s decision, and understand her desire to see our City unified,” adding: “Jazmine, your hometown loves you!”\n\nGreg Boulware, the union president, said he was “profoundly humbled” by Sullivan’s decision to back out of her performance.\n\n“It’s truly refreshing to witness a celebrity of her stature and a native Philadelphian recognizing and valuing the tireless dedication of municipal workers,” he said in a statement.\n\nWawa Welcome America is one of the nation’s largest July Fourth celebrations. A representative for the festival did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn July 1 — after the city of Philadelphia was granted three injunctions — a judge ordered some union members to return to work. In response, the unionencouragedaffected members to “comply with this directive immediately to avoid any legal consequences.”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_text":"UPS plans to offer voluntary buyouts to unionized delivery drivers for the first time in its history as it looks to align the workforce with the downsizing of its domestic ground network and Amazon business.\n\nThe news follows management’s disclosure in April of intentions to eliminate 20,000 front-line positions as part of a broader effort to cut excess capacity and improve profits. UPS’s (NYSE: UPS) network optimization plan, called Network of the Future, envisions closing 200 sortation centers over five years and increasing automation for handling packages. Dozens of facilities have already been consolidated in the past year.\n\nPackage drivers would “receive a generous financial package if they choose to leave UPS” on top of earned retirement benefits, including pension and healthcare, the parcel freight company said in a statement Thursday. “As we navigate an unprecedented business landscape, we are executing the largest network reconfiguration in UPS history” and need to similarly adjust headcount, the company explained.\n\nParcel volumes are under pressure from a variety of headwinds, including Trump administration tariffs that have slowed imports and a January decision to reduce Amazon business by 50% over 18 months because so much of it is unprofitable.\n\nUPS’s voluntary severance plan angered the Teamsters union, which says the Atlanta-based company is obligated to create 30,000 jobs under a five-year contract ratified in August 2023, which forestalled a nationwide strike. It urged members to reject the buyout offer.\n\n“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers. It is an illegal violation of our national contract,” said Teamsters President Sean O’Brien in a news release. “UPS is obligated to establish tens of thousands of new full-time jobs under the agreement. But CEO Carol Tomé and UPS’s corporate managers are hoping that if they offer paltry severance packages to enough workers, no one will notice the company is setting the union’s contract on fire. UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect.”\n\nTeamster contracts enable UPS drivers employed 30 years or more to receive employer-paid health care throughout retirement, a benefit that would not be guaranteed to all workers under UPS’s severance plan, according to the union. The current contract calls for UPS to elevate 22,500 part-time workers to full-time positions and create another 7,500 positions.\n\n“We have approached the Teamsters on this topic and remain committed to the agreements we reached in 2023,” UPS said.\n\nThe Teamsters, which represents 340,000 UPS workers,last week accused UPSof failing to comply with the hiring requirement and a commitment to provide 28,000 air conditioned package cars and vans for heat relief in many parts of the country. It requested data from UPS on the status of open positions, as well as the delivery rate for vehicles equipped with air conditioning. The Teamsters gave the company until July 1 to provide answers, but the company has requested additional time to respond, the union said.\n\n“Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. The Teamsters are prepared to fight UPS on every front with every available resource to shut down this illegal buyout program,” O’Brien said. “UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments, just as Teamsters do every day, reliably delivering packages to hundreds of millions of Americans. Profits are not more important than people, not at UPS or any other employer.”\n\nUPS executives said during April’s earnings presentation that the company expects to save more than $1.2 billion this year by eliminating 25 million operating hours across the workforce. A similar amount in semi-variable cost reductions are estimated from the reduction of 20,000 employees.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves\/PostalMag stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nTeamsters complain UPS slow to deploy air conditioned vehicles\n\nSwitch to UPS saved US Postal Service 43% in air transport costs\n\nUPS to eliminate 20K jobs as Amazon decoupling accelerates\n\nThe postUPS drivers to receive buyout offer as company shrinks parcel networkappeared first onFreightWaves.",

Based on the city charter, there's nothing preventing it.\n\nIs it going to ?\n\n\"I don't think so, \" Mayor Danielle Trumble told The Dominion Post, explaining she's not been involved in any conversations regarding the law's repeal.\n\n\"I respect the decision of the voters, \" she added. \"But this is a good time to ensure that we are being compassionate with enforcement.\"\n\nThe Morgantown camping ban debate kicked off July 2, 2024, and basically ran hot until the end of April, when Morgantown's voters opted not to repeal the ban in a closely contested ballot referendum — 982 voted against repeal while 904 voted to strike it from the books.\n\nAs part of that same ballot, Morgantown elected two new council members, shifting the apparent majority opinion on the issue based on votes cast and \/or public commentary offered by Trumble, Deputy Mayor Brian Butcher, Jodi Hollingshead and Mark Downs.\n\nBut even if a majority of council is aligned and the city's charter is hands-off on the matter, repealing a law immediately after it was upheld by the voters is shaky ground — not only electorally, but potentially legally.\n\nWhen asked about the legality of a repeal, Trumble consulted the city's attorney and said she was informed that while there's nothing preventing it, there would likewise be nothing preventing a lawsuit for negating the vote.\n\nFurther, it was explained that most places build in a moratorium on action involving the subject of a referendum.\n\nAs for enforcement, Morgantown Communications Director Brad Riffee said there had been six warnings issued—but no citations written—as of Wednesday morning. The law took effect June 4.\n\nUnder the ordinance, a first violation results in a written warning and information about available shelter and services. A second violation may result in a fine of up to $200, and a third violation within a year may result in a fine up to $500 and \/or up to 30 days in jail.\n\nIndividuals cited under the law are eligible for alternative sentencing if they seek assistance with substance use, mental health, or housing-related case management. The city is working with Valley HealthCare Systems to manage the alternative sentencing program.\n\nFurther, the law says no citation will be issued unless the person in violation has been offered \"alternative shelter \" and refused the offer. An offer of shelter means an alternate location, which may include \"emergency shelter or any alternate indoor or outdoor location where the person may sleep overnight.\"\n\nThe problem is—and has been—that there are very limited shelter beds in and around Morgantown.\n\nDuring the most recent council meeting, Butcher said the West Virginia Coalition to End Homelessness made him aware of multiple individuals whose offer of alternative shelter was in another city.\n\n\"If this shelter was aware of the fact that we were sending people there, they would probably not be too happy about it. It was out of town. I don't know how that necessarily qualifies as an offer of shelter. Technically, I guess it does, \" he said. \"This is what I was worried about, and the things I was talking about when I said we're putting our first responders in a bad position—where they have to respond to these things in ways that don't necessarily meet the needs of the people they're talking to.\"",
    "Atomic_Facts":"[\"Morgantown City Council's debate on the camping ban began on July 2, 2024, and culminated in a ballot referendum on April 29, 2025, where 982 voters opted against repeal while 904 voted for it.\", \"As of July 5, 2025, Morgantown Communications Director Brad Riffee reported that six warnings had been issued under the camping ban ordinance, which took effect on June 4, 2025, but no citations had been written.\\n```\"]"

    "News_text":"By Lawrence White\n\nLONDON (Reuters) -Stocks slipped on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump got his signature tax cut bill over the line and attention turned to his July 9 deadline for countries to secure trade deals with the world's biggest economy.\n\nThe dollar also fell against major currencies, with U.S. markets already shut for the holiday-shortened week, as traders considered the impact of Trump's sweeping spending bill that is expected to add an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.5%, with banks, mining-related stocks and retailers among the top laggards.\n\nU.S. S&P 500 futures edged down 0.6%, following a 0.8% overnight advance for the cash index to an all-time closing peak. Wall Street was closed on Friday for the Independence Day holiday.\n\nTrump said Washington would start sending letters to countries on Friday specifying what tariff rates they would face on exports to the United States, a clear shift from earlier pledges to strike scores of individual deals before a July 9 deadline when tariffs could rise sharply.\n\nInvestors are \"now just waiting for July 9\", said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG, with the market's lack of optimism for trade deals responsible for some of the equity weakness in export-reliant Asia, particularly Japan and South Korea.\n\nAt the same time, investors cheered a surprisingly robust U.S. jobs report on Thursday, sending all three of the main U.S. equity indexes climbing in a shortened session.\n\n\"The U.S. economy is holding together better than most people expected, which suggests to me that markets can easily continue to do better (from here),\" Sycamore said.\n\nFollowing Thursday's close, the House narrowly approved Trump's signature, 869-page bill, which averts the near-term prospect of a U.S. government default but adds trillions to the national debt to fuel spending on border security and the military.\n\nTRADE THE KEY FOCUS IN ASIA\n\nTrump said he expected \"a couple\" more trade agreements, after announcing a deal with Vietnam on Wednesday to add to framework agreements with China and Britain as the only successes so far.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that a deal with India was close. However, progress on agreements with Japan and South Korea, once touted by the White House as likely to be among the earliest to be announced, appears to have broken down.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index had its worst first half since 1973 as Trump's chaotic roll-out of sweeping tariffs heightened concerns about the U.S. economy and the safety of Treasuries, but had rallied 0.4% on Thursday before retracing some of those gains on Friday.\n\nAs of 1430 GMT it was down 0.1% at 96.94.\n\nThe euro added 0.2% to $1.1778, while sterling held steady at $1.3662 as British assets steadied following investor fright over the last two days at a tearful appearance by Finance Minister Rachel Reeves in parliament on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury bond market was closed on Friday for the holiday, but 10-year yields rose 4.7 basis points (bps) to 4.34%, while the 2-year yield jumped 9.3 bps to 3.882%.\n\nGold firmed 0.4% to $3,336 per ounce, on track for a weekly gain as investors again sought refuge in safe-haven assets due to concerns over the U.S.'s fiscal position and tariffs.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 57 cents to $68.23 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 66 cents to $66.34, as Iran reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence White in London and Kevin Buckland in Tokyo; Editing by Stephen Coates, Kim Coghill, Alexandra Hudson, Joe Bavier and Alex Richardson)",

    "News_title":"Iran struck five Israeli military bases during 12-day war",
    "News_text":"Iranian missilesappear to have directly hit five Israeli military facilities during the recent12-day war, according to radar data seen by The Telegraph.\n\nThe strikeshave not been made public by the Israeli authorities and cannot be reported from within the country because of strict military censorship laws.\n\nThey will further complicate the battle of words between the enemies, with both sides attempting to claim absolute victory.\n\nThe new data were shared with The Telegraph by US academics at Oregon State University, who specialise in using satellite radar data to detect bomb damage in war zones.\n\nIt suggests five previously unreported military facilities were hit by sixIranian missilesin the north, south and centre of Israel, including a major air base, an intelligence gathering centre and a logistics base.\n\nApproached by The Telegraph on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it would not comment onmissile interception ratesor damage to its bases.\n\n“What we can say is that all relevant units maintained functional continuity throughout the operation,” said a spokesman.\n\nThe strikes on the military facilities are in addition to 36 others known to have pierced Israeli air-defence systems, causing significant damage to residential and industrial infrastructure.\n\nDespite the considerable damage to residential property across the country, only 28 Israelis died – a testament to the country’s sophisticated alert system and the disciplined use of bomb shelters and safe rooms by the population.\n\nAnalysis by The Telegraph suggests that while the vast majority of Iranian missiles were intercepted, the proportion that got through grew steadily in the first eight days of the 12-day war.\n\nThe reasons for this, say experts, are not clear but may include the rationing of a limited stock of interceptor missiles on the Israeli side and improved firing tactics and the possible use of more sophisticated missiles by Iran.\n\nAlthough the Iron Dome is Israel’s best-known air-defence system, it is actually designed to protect against short-range projectiles such as mortars and is only one part of the “layered” air-defence system the country uses.\n\nIn the middle tier stands the David’s Sling air-defence system, which is optimised for intercepting drones and missiles with ranges up to 300km. At the top is the Arrow system, which engages long-range ballistic missiles before they re-enter the atmosphere.\n\nImportantly, the Israeli systems were backed up throughout the 12-day war by two US ground-based THAAD missile-defence systems and ship-based interceptors launched from US assets in the Red Sea.\n\nThe US is estimated to have launched at least 36 THAAD interceptors during the war at a cost of some $12 million a time.\n\nIn Israel, a densely packed small country of just 9.7 million people, the piercing of the country’s famed missile-defence systems has come as a shock, with the authorities having to issue notices warning that they were “not hermetic”.\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\nThe 15,000 made homeless are especially conspicuous as they have been distributed to hotel accommodation throughout the country and the restriction of residential sites has been reported freely.\n\nBut there has also been growing suspicion within the country that military targets were hit.\n\nRaviv Drucker of Channel 13, one of the country’s best-known journalists, said last week: “There were a lot of [Iranian] missile hits in IDF bases, in strategic sites that we still don’t report about to this day... It created a situation where people don’t realise how precise the Iranians were and how much damage they caused in many places”.\n\nCorey Scher, a researcher at Oregon State University, said his unit was working on a fuller assessment of missile damage in both Israel and Iran, and would publish its findings in around two weeks.\n\nHe said the radar system data that they used to assess damage measured changes in the built environment to detect blasts and that absolute confirmation of hits would necessitate either on-the-ground reporting at the military sites concerned or satellite pictures.\n\nThe Telegraph’s data analysis shows the combined US and Israeli defence systems performed well overall, but were letting through around 16 per cent of missiles by day seven of the war.\n\nThis broadly accords with an earlier IDF estimate for the defence system that put the success rate at “87 per cent”.\n\nIn Iran, Islamic Republic officials and state media are using footage of missiles penetrating Israeli air defences in an attempt to convince domestic audiences they won the war.\n\nThere are cartoons mocking the Iron Dome in Iranian media with revolutionary songs playing over videos of missiles hitting Israeli cities.\n\nIranian officials say that the main way Israel’s air defences were pierced was by using missiles and drones at the same time to confuse defence systems.\n\nFast missiles mixed with slower drones confused the defences and made them split their attention, officials claim.\n\n“The main goal of firing [suicide drones] at Israel is always to keep their systems busy,” one Iranian official told The Telegraph. “Many don’t even get through – they’re intercepted – but they still cause confusion.”\n\nMaj Gen Ali Fazli, the IRGC’s deputy commander-in-chief, appeared on state TV on Thursday night, claiming implausibly that Iran was “in the best defensive position in the 47-year history of the Islamic Revolution – never before have we been at such a level in terms of military readiness, operational cohesion, and fighter morale”.\n\nThis despite Israel’s proven ability to strike at will over the entire country and the substantial damage caused to the country’s military leadership and nuclear programme.\n\nNevertheless, it is likely that a large part of Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal remains untouched. Even by Israeli estimates, only half of its launchers were destroyed in the 12-day conflict and substantial stocks of missiles remain.\n\n“Iran had about 400 launchers, and we destroyed more than 200 of them, which caused a bottleneck in their missile operations,” an Israeli military official said on Thursday\n\nThey added: “We assessed that Iran had approximately 2,000 to 2,500 ballistic missiles at the beginning of this conflict. However, they were rapidly moving toward a mass-production strategy, which could see their missile stockpile grow to 8,000 or even 20,000 missiles in the next few years.”\n\nMaj Gen Fazli claimed that underground “cities” of missiles remained untouched in Iran.\n\n“We have not yet opened the doors of even one of our missile cities,” he claimed on Thursday.\n\n“We assess that so far only about 25 to 30 per cent of existing missile capability has been used and, at the same time, the production cycle is powerfully supporting this operational capacity.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The company faces a lawsuit related to the merger and also has been struggling with labor unrest.\n\nEmployees had been threatening to strike until the company reached atentative agreementwith the United Food and Commercial Workers union this week.\n\nBased in Cincinnati, Kroger also owns Harris Teeter, King Soopers and Dillons. The company operates more than 2,700 stores under different brands across the country and offers fresh goods, some household items and pharmacy services.\n\nRead more:Kroger, the company behind Ralphs and Food 4 Less, plans to close 60 locations\n\n\"Instead of popping champagne and toasting to their merger, Kroger is instead just enduring one hit after another,\" said Jeff Wells, lead editor at the trade publication Grocery Dive. \"They're still a pretty stable business, but they're facing a lot in terms of challenges.\"\n\nKroger announced late last month in its quarterly earnings report that itplans to close60 stores over the next 18 months. The company did not disclose which locations would be shut down.\n\n\"We're simplifying our business and reviewing areas that will not be meaningful to our future growth,\" interim Chief Executive Ronald Sargent said in an earnings call. \"Today, not all of our stores are delivering the sustainable results we need.\"\n\nKroger temporarily paused routine store closures while the Albertsons merger was pending, Sargent said. The company normally closes about 30 stores per year, Melius Research analyst Jacob Aiken-Phillips said.\n\nThe company is on track to complete 30 major store projects this year and expects to accelerate store openings in 2026, Sargent said on the earnings call.\n\nKroger is under increasing pressure from competitors, experts said, some of which offer a wider range of items and convenient one-stop shops.\n\n\"Kroger faces this intensely competitive field in the grocery industry,\" Wells said. \"From Walmart to Costco to Whole Foods and Sprouts Farmers Market, everybody in the industry is kind of gunning for them.\"\n\nThe Albertsons merger would have given Kroger the scale to compete with giants such as Walmart and Amazon, Aiken-Phillips said.\n\n\"After the merger failed, they had to reexamine their strategy and focus on how they can grow and compete without that scale,\" he said. \"That's the major challenge right now.\"\n\nRead more:After court loss, Albertsons and Kroger trade accusations over demise of mega-grocery-chain deal\n\nKroger relies on pharmacy services, advertising and e-commerce for additional revenue, experts said.

    "News_title":"What Trump—And the U.S.—Can’t Understand About Air Strikes",
    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nWhen Donald Trump ordered air strikes on key Iranian nuclear-enrichment sites last month and immediately declared that the targets had been “completely and totally obliterated,” he was counting on a single display of overwhelming air power to accomplish a major strategic goal. Though initially hesitant to join Israel’s 10-day-old bombing campaign against Iran, the president came to believe that the United States could finish off Tehran’s nuclear ambitions all at once. After what he called a “very successful attack,” Trump demanded that Israel and Iran stop fighting, declaring, “NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!”\n\nIn reality, the U.S. attack may have only delayed the Iranian program by months. Trump ended up short-circuiting both his own efforts at diplomacy with Iran and an extraordinary Israeli campaign that required years of elaborate preparation, rendered Iran’s air-defense network inoperable, and allowed Israeli forces to methodically work through a long list of target sites across the country over the course of a week and a half. Destroying a military target from the air usually requires multiple raids on the site—not one night and a victory declaration on Truth Social. Israeli military planners had clearly hoped to enlist American help in attacking Iran but may not have anticipated that it would be for one night only.\n\nTo some extent, Trump’s approach is typical of American leaders, who have routinely underestimated the true complexities of military tasks and assumed that a burst of overwhelming force will secure U.S. objectives and allow Washington to impose its version of peace. Recent events—not just in the Middle East but also in Ukraine—suggest that smaller countries with fewer resources than the United States have a far more urgent understanding specifically of how to use air power and generally of how to defeat their enemies.\n\n[Read: Trump’s One-and-Done Doctrine]\n\nAn unbounded faith in American military might, combined with a desire not to get bogged down in long foreign engagements, has led to excesses of optimism in the past: the constant escalation cycle in Vietnam, when it was said that more force would bring victory; the infamousmission accomplishedbanners after U.S. forces deposed Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. In conflicts since the end of World War II, the U.S. military has prevailed in individual battles, but it has won only one clear victory in a war: Operation Desert Storm in 1991. This conundrum has led to far less introspection than it deserves.\n\nOne of the reasons might be that U.S. military power has been so extensive that the military, and policy makers, have not had to think too deeply about the process of winning wars. For 80 years, the U.S. military could be deployed to occupy territory, blow up structures, or destroy an enemy force—and was able to do it. It could inflict a frightening toll on its enemies at remarkably little cost to itself.\n\nThe risk of overestimating American capabilities may be greatest in decisions about applying air power. The U.S. has the most awesome air force the world has ever seen. (Not coincidentally, the successful Desert Storm campaign involved purposeful and relentless air attacks on enemy targets.) Such power has immense costs, however, one of which is the destructive luxury of not having to think deeply about just what it means to win a war. American policy makers feel able to lecture smaller powers about what they should and should not do. Trump pushed Israel—which had, remarkably, achieved the ability to move freely in Iranian airspace—to stand down before the U.S. could reliably ascertain whether its own air strikes had been effective.\n\nSince 2022, bad instructions from the United States have been devastating to Ukraine’s effort to fight off Russian invaders. Under the Biden administration, the United States feared escalation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and kept Ukrainians from using Western-made long-range weaponry to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia. In effect, the American veto created a large safe space in Russia, and gave the Russians the flexibility to plan and execute a hugely destructive strategic air campaign against Ukraine. Until Ukraine began developing its own systems, it was nearly powerless to stop the Russians from unleashing drones and missiles on Ukrainian military and civilian targets. Instead, the Ukrainians were forced to concentrate their resources on a bloody land war fought in trenches and by drones; despite large casualties on both sides, the fighting has produced only tiny changes in territorial control.\n\nUkraine has done its best to change this dynamic, by working to expand its own long-range capabilities andusing those weapons against targets in Russia. The tragedy for Ukrainians is that the Biden administration stood in their way for three years—and was succeeded by a Trump administration that, perhaps because of a broad sympathy with Putin, seems intent on letting Russia win.\n\n[Read: The problem with Trump’s cease-fire]\n\nFor all its advanced weaponry, the United States would benefit from listening to smaller, more inventive militaries that are fighting larger adversaries in a rapidly evolving technological environment. Ukraine, for example, has developed enormous expertise in designing and deploying unmanned aerial vehicles, which—as the recent attacks on Russian airfields thousands of miles away from the Ukrainian border showed—create new vulnerabilities at traditional military facilities.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing about recent U.S. actions suggests that the country’s leaders have any intention to learn from others. Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon seems obsessed with “lethality”—the idea that the United States wins wars by bringing greater lethal force to every direct engagement with the enemy. But although that focus might sound macho and hyper-militaristic to him and Trump, it may be the precursor to more events like Trump’s Iran strikes: showy tactical attacks that fail to accomplish any strategic goals of substance.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

Multiple units from the fire rescue team and Pinellas County Sheriff's Office responded and rendered emergency aid, Porrier said.\n\nTwo adult victims were treated on-scene and refused further treatment. A 17-year-old girl was taken to Tampa General Hospital. There was no immediate update available on her condition.\n\nCBS affiliate WTSP reportedthat the family had been standing under their umbrella during a thunderstorm. Jennifer Tillman said she saw the whole thing from her apartment overlooking the beach.\n\n\"You could hear it, it was coming closer and closer and closer, and then it happened,\" Tillman told WTSP. \"I don't know, I don't know. It was just one of those things, I don't know, that you can never - you can't unsee.\"\n\nTillman said that a Good Samaritan picked up the girl after the lightning strike. She said the other two people appeared to be in shock after the strike.\n\nImages from the scene showed the family's umbrella singed and snapped in half, with other belongings damaged by the lightning strike. Dead gulls were also visible in the area.\n\nThe safest place to be during a lightning storm is inside,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency recommends against carrying any metal objects, including umbrellas. Metal can conduct electricity, and a person is more likely to be struck by lightning if carrying a conductor above shoulder height.\n\n\"If you are out on the beach or anywhere with an umbrella that is taller than you, you are literally creating a lightning rod,\" WTSP meteorologist Bobby Deskins said.\n\nTillman said that just hours after the incident, the storm had cleared out and new beachgoers had come to celebrate the 4th of July with fireworks.\n\n\"A whole new wave of people came,\" Tillman said. \"Like nothing had ever happened.\"\n\nSt. Pete Beach is a small city on a barrier island in Pinellas County, about 20 miles southwest of Tampa.\n\nSeveral people missing from Texas summer camp amid deadly flooding, officials say\n\nWhat a new DOJ memo could mean for naturalized U.S. citizens\n\nJuly 4 holiday week expected to set record for travelers",

It found that 47% of claims filed by Texas homeowners had been closed out by insurance companies without payment.\n\nThe phenomenon itself isn't unusual — Martin Weiss, the agency's founder, told the Chronicle that it's common for a portion of claims to be invalid — but the rates are astonishing.\n\n\"50%? No, that's never been the case,\" he said.\n\nIn the wake of increasingly extreme weather events, insurance companies across the U.S. have dialed back coverage.

    "News_title":"How Obama dropped more than 26K bombs on 7 countries without congressional approval in 2016",
    "News_text":"Then-U.S. President Barack Obama dropped more than 26,000 bombs on seven countries — Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen — in 2016 alone. We determined this by looking at data from the U.S. Air Force, Council for Foreign Relations, the Long War Journal and the New America Foundation.\n\nObama did not obtain an act from Congress to conduct his military operations; however, his actions were not illegal. Congress passed a broad 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to approve war against al-Qaida and the Taliban, which Obama relied on to justify his military activities. However, Obama stretched use of the 2001 AUMF to target militant groups that either did not exist on Sept. 11, 2001, or were not al-Qaida affiliates.\n\nU.S. presidents have repeatedly conducted military activities in other countries without seeking approval from Congress. President Donald Trump justified military activities during his first administration by citing the AUMF as well.\n\nIn June 2025,U.S. President Donald Trumpauthorizedairstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities  withoutseekingcongressional approval. However, he is not the first president to do so. Many of Trump's supporters noted that former President Barack Obama carried out similar actions during his presidency.\n\nAccording to aposton X:\n\nin 2016, Obama dropped 26,000 bombs without congressional approval. 26,000...in just ONE year, in multiple countries\n\nThe above claim about Obama is technically correct in that he did not obtain an act of Congress to conduct his military activities, though numerous presidents — including Trump — have done the same. We looked through old databases and reports about Obama's airstrikes and drone warfare program conducted with coalition partners through the year 2016 to confirm the number of strikes he authorized.\n\nHowever, Obama relied on an Authorization for Use of Military Force that Congress issued in 2001 to target al- Qaida and the Taliban as a legal basis for his administration's military actions.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump sentstealth aircraftinto Iran with so-called Massive Ordnance Penetrator \"bunker buster bombs\" to reach concealed sites. Per a Pentagonbriefing, around 75 precision-guided weapons were used in the overall operation, which included missiles sent by a U.S. submarine toward Isfahan. Around 14 of the bunker busters hit their targets.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. along with a number of coalition partners beganOperation Inherent Resolveagainst the militant Islamic State group. The U.S.conductednumerous airstrikes in Iraq and Syria using both manned and unmanned aircraft, including drones. According todatafrom the U.S. Air Force Central Command, in 2016 the coalition dropped a total of 30,743 weapons in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAccording to ananalysisby the think tank Council for Foreign Relations, the U.S. carried out 79% of airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in 2016 and was responsible for 24,287 of these bombs.\n\nIn addition, throughOperation Enduring Sentinelin Afghanistan, the U.S. dropped a total of1,337 weaponsthrough both manned and unmanned aircraft, according to data collected by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, an independent media outlet.\n\nData from theLong War Journal— part of the conservativeFoundation for Defense of Democracies think tank —and the liberal think tank New America also found the U.S. conducted around 513 strikes inLibya, 43 inYemen, 14 inSomalia, and 3 inPakistanin 2016. This data didn't give the exact numbers of weapons used. Regardless, keeping in mind the number of strikes in Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan, as well as the quantity of weapons used in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the total still amounts to more than 26,000 bombs in seven countries in just 2016.\n\nTrump is not the first president who did not get congressional consent to carry out military actions in another country. In 1950, PresidentHarry Trumanused his authority to send U.S. troops to defend South Korea along with a U.N. Security Council resolution, but no authority from Congress. In the1980s,President Ronald Reagan ordered military force in Libya, Grenada and Lebanon, and in1989President George H.W. Bush directed the invasion of Panama to topple the dictator Manuel Noriega.\n\nAccording to aNational Constitution Centeranalysis, while the U.S. Constitution gives the president the title of commander in chief of all armed forces, onlyCongresscan declare war. Over the years,presidentshavebroadlyinterpreted their roles as commander in chief and often used it to bypass Congress.\n\nIn 1973, Congress passed theWar Powers Resolutionto ensure Congress had a role in approving U.S. involvement in any armed conflicts. However, Congress has alsopassednumerous Authorizations for the Use of Military Force that give the president the ability to carry out limited and clearly defined military actions. In practice, however, these AUMFs have been interpreted broadly to justify all kinds of military actions.\n\nIn 2001, Congresspassedan AUMF authorizing military actions against \"those responsible for the recent [Sept. 11, 2001] attacks against the United States.\" In 2002, Congresspassedanother AUMF calling for the use of military force against Iraq. When Obama ordered military intervention in 2011 in Libya without congressional approval, he said his actions did not fall under the War Powers Resolution.\n\nA 2016 analysis by left-leaning think tankCenter for American Progressfound that the Obama administration had continued to use this justification for drone strikes: \"Congress initially authorized war against al-Qaida and the Taliban in its 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, and the Obama administration continues to rely on that AUMF as congressional authority for ongoing military operations.\"\n\nThe Council for Foreign Relations alsoevaluatedthe legality of Obama's drone strikes in 2017. It found that the 2001 AUMF had been \"stretched\" by the Obama administration to \"justify strikes against terror groups that either did not exist on 9\/11, or are unaffiliated withal-Qaida. Yet, the AUMF remains the domestic legal underpinning for all U.S. military actions against Islamist terrorists.\"\n\nA 2016 paper by a pair of Duke and Harvard Law School professors, Curtis A. Bradley and Jack L. Goldsmith, on\"Obama's AUMF Legacy\"noted that Obama initially wanted to repeal the 2001 AUMF, but by the end of his presidency it acted as the legal underpinning for his military actions:\n\nDespite massive changes in the geographical scope of the conflict that began on 9\/11, the strategy and tactics employed, and the identity of the enemy, the AUMF remains the principal legal foundation under U.S. domestic law for the president to use force against and detain members of terrorist organizations. The AUMF is already the longest operative congressional authorization of military force in U.S. history, and, as of fall 2016, there was no immediate prospect that Congress would move to repeal or update it. With the continued vibrancy of Al Qaeda, its associates, and the Taliban, and with the 2014 presidential extension of the AUMF to cover military operations against the Islamic State, the AUMF is likely to be the primary legal basis for American uses of force for the foreseeable future.\n\n[…]\n\nFor many years, President Obama proclaimed that he wanted to repeal the AUMF and end the AUMF-authorized conflict. By the closing year of his presidency, however, his administration had established the AUMF as the legal foundation for an indefinite conflict against Al Qaeda and associated groups and extended that foundation to cover a significant new conflict against the Islamic State.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, Obama did try to get Congress topassan updated AUMF for his ongoing war against the Islamic State. In February 2015, he sent Congress a draft AUMF, but disagreements over how it would limit the powers of a future U.S. president, and even Obama, meant the measure stalled.\n\nIn 2020, Trump also cited the2002 AUMFas the legal justification for the Jan. 2, 2020, U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nObama did use more than 26,000 bombs in 2016 alone against seven countries. However, while he did not get congressional approval at the time, he relied on older congressional authorizations as the legal basis for such strikes, a practice that Trump also continued.\n\n\"Afghanistan: Reported US Air and Drone Strikes 2016.\" TBIJ,https:\/\/www.thebureauinvestigates.com\/drone-war\/data\/get-the-data-a-list-of-us-air-and-drone-strikes-afghanistan-2016.Accessed 24 June 2025.\n\n\"America's Counterterrorism Wars.\" New America,http:\/\/newamerica.org\/future-security\/reports\/americas-counterterrorism-wars\/.Accessed 24 June 2025.\n\nBradley, Curtis A., and Jack L.

    "News_title":"I Was Mauled Over and Over Again by a Grizzly. I Should Have Died",
    "News_text":"This story, “Day of Terror,” appeared in the June 1957 issue ofOutdoor Life.\n\nMarty Cordes and I spent the last half of September, 1955, hunting moose in the Chilkat River valley north of Haines, Alaska, where we live and work as con­struction men. We had no luck the first 10 days.\n\nI wounded a bull the second day, in a heavy rain, and fol­ lowed the blood trail until it washed out. For a week after that we didn’t lay eyes on a moose with horns, so finally we loaded our gear in the canoe and outboarded to a vacant cabin 10 miles farther up the Chilkat in moose country that had never failed me. We’d have gone there sooner, but fig­ured it might be too crowded with hunters to suit us.\n\nBut there was no cause for complaint on that score. We had things to ourselves, and saw enough moose sign the first day to convince us we’d come to the right place. An hour after we started out next morning, in a patch of willow­ grown muskeg about two miles from camp, we ran onto two bulls and several cows feeding. The breeding season for this group either had ended or not yet begun, for mature bull moose aren’t often found together during the rut. Anyway, the bulls were good ones and we dropped both of them.\n\nWe spent the rest of the day dressing them and packing part of the meat to camp. The remainder of the meat and the two hides we cached in trees, making sure everything was out of reach of bears. Browns and grizzlies are plentiful in the area, and we knew that any meat left where they could get at it would be almost sure to disappear overnight.\n\nThe following morning, September 30, we loaded the canoe with meat. Then Marty cranked the outboard and took off for Haines and my freezer. I made more trips for meat that afternoon and the next forenoon, and by the time Marty got back on Saturday, October 1, I had everything in camp except his moose hide. That was still stretched in a good-size birch, 10 or 12 feet off the ground, at the spot where he’d made the kill.\n\nSunday morning Marty wanted to pick up a mess of grouse for a stew, so I agreed to bring in the hide. We both planned to be back at the cabin about an hour before noon, ready to break camp and head home.\n\nWhen I arrived at the kill I found that bears had finally taken over. The ground looked as if someone had gone over it with a garden rake, and two neat mounds of grass and moss showed where they’d covered the uneaten entrails of both moose. That should have warned me, but it didn’t.\n\nMarty’s hide was still in the birch, unmolested. I walked over to the tree and threw my packboard down, and as I glanced up I saw movement in the brush about 300 feet away. I took another look and made out the backs and heads of two bears some 30 feet apart.\n\nThey didn’t scare me, though I was sure from their color and shape that they were grizzlies. All the bears I’d ever met lit out as soon as they discovered me, and I saw no rea­son to expect trouble with this pair. But almost instantly they went out of sight, and next thing I knew one was com­ing headlong at me through the thicket. I couldn’t see him, but the brush moved as he smashed through, so I could trace his course by the commotion he made.\n\nI still wasn’t scared. I jumped up and down and waved my arms, yelling to frighten him off. Then it dawned on me that this bear wasn’t going to bluff out. He was still coming hell-bent.\n\nI wasn’t carrying a rifle, or even a hunting knife. I’d gone light, my only purpose being to pack the 80-pound green moose hide into camp. There was only one thing to do. I jumped for a low branch of the birch and started up hand over hand. But before I’d climbed my own height the grizzly broke out of the brush and came swarming at me.\n\nHe didn’t fool around. He sank his teeth into the back of my right leg just above the knee and pulled me down with one savage yank. I landed on my back, and we tussled for a few seconds. I wound up in a sitting position, with the bear’s left front leg across both of mine, pinning me to the ground. With his teeth, he grabbed me·by the inside of the thigh just below the crotch, and in one deep, deliberate bite tore away a strip of flesh. Blood spurted, and I braced my­ self with my left arm and pummeled him in the face with my fist, but he paid no more attention than to a fly buzzing around his head.\n\nThat first minute was about as bad as any part of the whole ordeal. The bear’s face and mine weren’t a foot apart. He had a big, burly head, with long, stiff, gray guard hairs standing out all over his face. His eyes were red and flashing with hate, his muzzle was screwed up in a sullen mask, and he was slobbering as he chewed at my legs. He went on rip­ ping flesh, skin, and clothes to shreds, and every second I expected him to grab me by the throat and finish the job with one shake.\n\nI was wearing wool trousers and heavy wool underwear, but they gave me no protection. I could feel him grind the cloth into the flesh with each bite, and I realized he could tear my legs off and I’d have to sit there and let him do it. I punched him in the face until I broke my hand, but it did no good.\n\nSomewhere I’ve read that a merciful numbness comes over a man being mauled by a big animal. Maybe that happens in some cases, but it certainly didn’t in mine. I was anything but numb. I could feel every bite he took, and it hurt like hell.\n\nI don’t know how long it went on. Maybe a minute, maybe only a few seconds, but it seemed like an eternity. Suddenly it flashed through my mind that my only hope for survival was to play dead. I flopped over on my back and side, and made myself go limp.\n\nInstantly, the bear stopped chewing. He stood over me, keeping me pinned down with one leg. I even tried not to breathe. But in spite of my will power and the knowledge that my life hung in the balance, I couldn’t hold back a low groan.\n\nHe grabbed me as a cat grabs an escaping mouse, and again I felt his teeth sink deep. He slashed through my side and ripped loose a flap of skin and muscle that exposed my bladder. The pain was agonizing, but I lay still and let him tear. He took another bite or two, then dropped me.\n\nI don’t know whether I moved that time or whether he just wanted to make sure of finishing me. Anyway, he nailed me once more, this time by the back below my right shoulder. He bit through, ripped three ribs loose from the spine, and tore a hole all the way into my chest cavity. If he’d chomped a little lower, in the kidney area, that bite would have killed me.\n\nHe grabbed me as a cat grabs an escaping mouse, and again I felt his teeth sink deep. He slashed through my side and ripped loose a flap of skin and muscle that exposed my bladder.\n\nI didn’t fight back, move, or groan. I knew now it was a case of play dead or be dead. He dropped me and walked away. I couldn’t see him without turn­ing my head and I didn’t dare risk that, so I lay motionless and hoped he wouldn’t come back.\n\nBut suddenly I felt the muskeg shake under me and heard his heavy feet pounding in. He came with a queer sort of panting noise, not bawling or growl­ ing. I braced myself for another maul­ ing, but he didn’t touch me. I could see his feet and lower legs, a yard from my face. He stood and looked me over for maybe a minute. Then he turned and slowly walked away.\n\nPerhaps five minutes later he re­peated the performance, coming for me at a panting run, standing over me without molesting me, then walking off. My possum act must have been pretty good.\n\nFor a long time I neither saw nor heard him. It was becoming hard for me to breathe because of the hole in. my back, and I realized that unless I turned over on my face and let my nose and mouth drain I would strangle. I waited as long as I could, finally de­cided the bear had left for keeps, and slowly and painfully managed to roll over. Nothing happened, and I began to think the worst was over.\n\nLong after that I thought I heard faint sounds at the moose leavings, 100 feet away, but when I held my breath to listen the noise stopped. That hap­pened three or four times. Then I felt the muskeg quake under me once more and heard that queer panting. No noise out of the pit of hell itself could have sounded worse to me.\n\nThe bear must have sensed from my position that I’d moved. He let out a murderous roar and tore into me again, grabbing me by the buttocks. He spanned my whole rear with his jaws, bit through to the bone, then took a deeper bite as if he meant to cut me in two.\n\nNext he picked me off the ground and shook me until I thought my back would break or my head snap off. I’ve seen bears kill salmon that way, shat­tering the spine with one flick of their jaws, and I was sure the same thing was going to happen to me. But he dropped me as abruptly as he’d seized me, then lumbered off. I heard his heavy footfalls fade away.\n\nHe’d dropped me face down, so I was in no danger of choking. But cold water from the muskeg was seeping through my clothing, chilling me to the bone, and I was in pain beyond description. The bear had torn the flesh away from the bones on the inside of my legs, ripped both buttocks, mangled my right hand, torn one rib entirely out and left two others protruding through the skin, punched a big hole through to my lung cavity, and chewed me from head to knees.\n\nSuddenly I decided I couldn’t stand the pain any longer. I might as well get it over with. Other men badly mauled by bears had killed themselves, and now I knew why.\n\nWhat I did next sounds crazy and impossible, and maybe you won’t even be­lieve it. But I’ll take an oath that it happened, and before you pass judg­ment try to imagine my torture.\n\nI was convinced I was going to die. I couldn’t see a chance of getting out alive, lying there in the muskeg by my­self, not knowing when or if Cordes would find me. Suddenly I decided I couldn’t stand the pain any longer. I might as well get it over with. Other men badly mauled by bears had killed themselves, and now I knew why.\n\nI worked a hand down into my pocket and managed to get out a small jacknife I carried. It must have taken me half an hour. Then I moved my arms up in front of my head, opened the knife, and slashed my left wrist deeply, trying for the big artery. No blood came, and I hardly felt the pain over the flashes of agony that were stabbing through my body. I slashed again. At the third slash I exposed my wrist ten­dons, but still no blood came.\n\nIt didn’t occur to me that I’d simply missed the artery. I thought I’d lost so much blood there was none left to flow. That meant I couldn’t bleed myself to death through the wrist, and if I cut the tendons and then by some miracle sur­vived I’d have a crippled hand for life. I was willing to kill myself, but I wasn’t willing to chance that. So I gave up.\n\nThe next idea that came to me, born of pain and desperation, was even more horrible. If I could find my jugular vein with my knife, I’d be sure of a quick and merciful death. Something warned me I mustn’t fumble or I’d sever my windpipe instead and strangle in my own blood. I laid the fingers of my good hand against my throat, feeling for the pulse that would mark the loca­tion of a big vein, but couldn’t find it. The effort was almost too much for me. I slumped and rested, and started ex­ploring again. Then, off in the brush, I heard Marty hail!\n\nHe was beside himself with horror when he saw me. His first thought was to try packing me the two miles back to camp. But when he started to lift me I screamed, and we gave that up. The pain was more than I could bear. That meant Marty would have to go for help, all the way to Haines, and I’d have to take my chances while he was gone. It wasn’t a pleasant prospect, but we agreed there was no choice.\n\nFirst he made a fast trip to camp and brought back a sleeping bag and air mattress, shotgun and shells, cigarettes, water bottle, food, matches, and a gas lantern. He somehow got me into the bag, hung most of his outer clothing on bushes over my head to keep off the cold drizzle that was now falling, laid the loaded shotgun beside me, lighted the gas lantern, and set it within reach.\n\n“I’ll make the fastest trip any man ever made to Haines,” he promised.\n\n“I’ll be here when you get back,” I told him, but I was far from sure.\n\nIt was now midafternoon. The bear had jumped me about 10:15 a.m. I was sure of the time, since I’d looked at my watch just before I came in sight of the moose hide in the tree. I couldn’t expect Marty before midnight. He had two miles to get to camp, a round trip of 30 miles by outboard and 60 by truck, and it would take him a while to round up a rescue party. Then too, the Chilkat is a glacial river running through steep country, quick to flood and also quick to drop. It was at low stage now, and I knew Marty would have trouble finding enough water for a fast run, especially coming back upstream in the dark with passengers. At best I had eight or nine hours to wait for help, maybe more. I doubted I’d be able to hang on that long. There was also the grizzly to worry about. I had a feeling he was still around.\n\nAn hour or so after Marty left I started to feel better. The pain les­sened and I began to warm up, and I decided that maybe I was going to make it after all. The afternoon light faded; dusk was coming. Everything had been quiet and peaceful for hours. I almost stopped worrying about the bear, but I fought off the impulse to doze. Then suddenly the muskeg shook under me and I heard that queer, snuffling, pant­ing noise once more.\n\nMy arms were inside the sleeping bag and my face was covered with the top of it. I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe. He stopped a few feet away, let out a blood-chilling roar, and then I heard him turn and run off. I suppose the gas lantern, the bag and Marty’s clothes draped over the brush were too much for him.\n\nLord in heaven, what a relief it was when he went away! But I still lay tense with dread for maybe half an hour, and then I heard a new noise over on my right. Something was rustling in the brush.\n\nI had my arms out now, my face uncovered, and my hand on the gun. I twisted my head to look that way, and in the gathering twilight, not more than 15 feet away, stood a small bear cub. Whether the bear that had attacked me was a sow rather than a male, and whether the cub belonged to her, I’ll never know. I don’t think it was a sow, for I was mauled by a grizzly, while the cub looked like a young black.\n\nIn any case, I was sure his old lady wasn’t far off and I didn’t want him to bring her down on me. He took a few steps toward me, looking with lively curiosity, and I didn’t quite know what to do. If I scared him and he squalled, I’d be in for more trouble. Finally I tried a loud, sharp hiss. That did it. He swapped ends and ran without a sound. Five minutes later I heard more rustling at the edge of the brush. There was the cub again, back with a twin! I hissed at the two of them and they scrammed, but they were too curious to stay away. They came back, like two black imps, and for half an hour kept me on pins and needles, taking turns circling me and pussyfooting in for a look, but never coming closer than about 15 feet. I lay there, not knowing how to drive them off for keeps and dreading the minute when ma would come ambling along to investigate what they’d found. At last they scurried off, and everything grew quiet again.\n\nIt was close to full dark when the gas lantern burned down and went out. By itself that was a small happening, but in my situation it was big and terrify­ ing. I felt I had no protection against the oncoming night, and fear that the grizzly might return began to mount in me, bordering on panic. Then he came, just as I knew he would.\n\nI heard the strange panting off in the brush, but he didn’t rush me this time. He came slowly, at my head where I couldn’t see him, stalking me, probably made cautious by his earlier encounter with the lantern. I figured he’d jump me, once he satisfied himself the light was gone.\n\nraised the shotgun, aimed it in the direction of the noise, elevated the barrel so no pellets would strike him, and pulled the trigger. A red stab of flame shot from the muzzle, a kick jolted me from head to foot, and a blast ripped the night apart. It must have scared the bear half out of his wits. He let go a strangled roar, and I heard brush crack as he pounded off. Then all was silent.\n\nSoon after that I heard bears at the moose remains, growling and gnawing. It was a horrid noise that went on three or four hours, but nothing came near me. My fear gradually subsided. Given any kind of break now, Marty and the rescue party would find me alive.\n\nBut I wasn’t quite through with the killer. About an hour before midnight I heard that horrible panting once more. He was coming from my left, walking in cautiously. I brought the shotgun into position with the barrels laid across my body, and got set to nail him.\n\nI knew the risk involved if the shot only wounded him, but anything was better than lying there and letting him get at me. I couldn’t take another going over. I’d let him come within 10 feet. If he approached that close he meant business. I’d be able to make him out then and I’d give him both barrels to­ gether, square in the face. It might drive him off even if it didn’t kill him. When he was about 25 feet away he stopped.\n\nI heard him panting and snuffling, like a giant trying to clear his throat, and then he circled me, prowl­ ing in from the other side. I trained the gun that way and waited, but he came no nearer. Apparently the set-up was too strange for him to tackle. He nosed around for five or 10 minutes, then moved off. My bear troubles were over at last.\n\nAround midnight I heard the far-off thrum of Marty’s outboard. I doubt I’ll ever hear another sound as welcome. It grew louder and nearer, then stopped abruptly. I figured the rescue party was at the cabin, heading for me on foot.\n\nAfraid they’d have trouble finding me in the darkness, I’d taken half a dozen matches out of my pocket, ready for striking as soon as I heard anyone approaching. I hung onto them for what seemed like hours but actually was only about 30 minutes. While I waited I heard the sound of an outboard once more, miles and hours away down­ river, and my hopes sank. I was too far gone to figure out that it was a second boat, feeling its way up the Chilkat behind Marty, but still a long way off.\n\nI listened, trying not to worry, and at last I heard voices. I struck the matches all at once, and somebody said “There he is! There’s a light!” I have no words to tell you how I felt right then.\n\nIt had been 141\/2 hours since my ordeal began. That’s a long, long time to wait for death or salvation.\n\nFlashlights winked through the dark­ness, and half a minute later Marty and two other friends from Haines were standing over me. The tension left me, and I took the first easy breath I’d drawn since the bear grabbed me. I asked what time it was and somebody said 12:45. It had been 141\/2 hours since my ordeal began. That’s a long, long time to wait for death or salvation.\n\nThe two friends Marty had brought were Carl Reinmiller and Walt Dueman. Carl is a retired army major, minus three fingers and an eye as a result of a ruckus on a South Sea island in World War II, and the top first-aid authority around Haines. _He did what he could for me, giving me an injection of penicillin and another of morphine, and then they eased me onto a stretcher they’d brought.\n\nThey lost the trail in the darkness, and it took them 3½ hours to carry me to the cabin. The pain and jolting weren’t as bad as I’d expected, for the morphine was biting in by that time, and I’m sure the trip was just as tough for Walt, Carl, and Marty as for me.\n\nApparently the bear didn’t like giving me up, for twice on the way to camp my friends heard him bawling in the distance. They believe he trailed us about halfway in, sullen and quarrel­ some but unwilling to jump a party that size.\n\nA second rescue party of three men was waiting at the cabin. Their boat was the one I’d heard away off down the Chilkat. They got into camp just before we arrived.\n\nShortly after 8 o’clock next morning, Dr. Robert Schuler of Juneau reached the cabin. He’d been in Haines the night before when Marty brought in the word about me, and had left at daylight with John Fox in Fox’s airboat. They hadn’t dared to tackle the river with the fast airboat in the dark, but made it in 45 minutes once they started. It had taken Marty four hours, and the other boat party almost eight. The Chilkat is a toughie to run at night.\n\nBy that time the full-scale rescue ma­ chinery of both Alaska and Canada was in motion in my behalf. At 10 a.m. a big helicopter from the R.C.A.F. base at Whitehorse, 100 miles away, landed on the little clearing in front of the cabin. The machine had been torn down for overhaul the day before, but when word of my plight reached the base, late in the evening, the repair crew worked all night to put it back together and in shape to undertake the rescue.\n\nThe huge whirly-bird carried a five­ man crew, including a doctor and nurse, plasma, and drugs, but they didn’t waste much time treating me in camp. I was a critical case by that time. They bundled me aboard and got me to Haines in short order, dripping plasma into me on the way. A Coast Guard plane was waiting there, and a little after noon an ambulance unloaded me at St. Anne’s Hospital in Juneau.\n\nIn all, there were more than 100 tooth marks on me, from my shoulders to my knees, plus countless cuts and gashes in my back and side. Several ribs were broken, one was torn out, and part of two had to be removed.\n\nJust 27 hours after the bear nabbed me I was on the operating table, and a Juneau surgeon, Dr. Cass Carter, an enthusiastic big-game hunter, started in on me.\n\nI didn’t get there any too soon. In all, there were more than 100 tooth marks on me, from my shoulders to my knees, plus countless cuts and gashes in my back and side. Several ribs were broken, one was torn out, and part of two had to be removed. The end of one had pressed in against a lung, but luckily hadn’t punctured it.\n\nThe doctor cut, sewed, and patched for three hours, bolstering me with blood transfusions, and he told me later he wouldn’t have given two bits for the chances of any man with my injuries unless medical help had got to him within six hours. I had waited a lot longer than that.\n\nMy life hung by a thread for days after Dr. Carter was through. After that, though I wouldn’t have won any beauty prizes, I was in better shape than I’d any right to expect.\n\nI came out of it pretty well. I was in the hospital from October 3 to De­cember 10 and went home 30 pounds underweight, but I’ve gained it back. I’m permanently short three ribs, and have some pretty tough-looking scars. My right hand is banged up, the third finger half an inch shorter than it used to be, but I can make out with it. My right side still pains at times, but I’m back at work and getting along all right.\n\nMarty, Dr. Cass, and I built a cabin in that same area last summer, and hunted there last fall. Doc and I both took moose. I nailed mine only about 400 yards from where the bear attacked me. All the time I was out I was look­ ing for a grizzly with stiff gray whisk­ers. I didn’t run into him, but we had proof he or others like him were still around. Cass killed his moose just be­ fore dark, and we had time only to dress it out and cover it with a tarp that night. We’d been told that if we built a fence of sticks a couple of feet high around the kill it would keep bears off, so we tried it.\n\nNext morning we found the fence knocked down, the moose head dragged off to one side, and the tarp pulled aside. We even came across a round depression in a patch of sand, made by that fat rump of a bear as he sat to size things up. But the noise of our airboat or our approach must have spooked him, for he left without feed­ ing. We saw no more of him, and packed the meat to the cabin without delay.\n\nRead Next:Giant Grizzly Taken in Alaska Is a New Record, Confirms Boone & Crockett\n\nYou can be sure of one thing, too. We kept a rifle handy while we were doing it. No bear or any other danger­ous animal will ever again catch me with my guard down.\n\nOne detail is left. We never got that moose hide of Marty’s back to camp. It’s still in the birch tree, so far as I know, and it can stay there forever for all of me.",

    "News_title":"As bridge repairs add up, North Dakota might need to rethink approach, Gov. Kelly Armstrong says",
    "News_text":"Jul. 5—GRAND FORKS — North Dakota has 1,325 bridges identified as needing repairs, according to a national report.\n\nAnd of the 4,255 bridges in North Dakota, 11% — or 467 of them — are structurally deficient, according to data compiled and distributed by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. North Dakota ranks No. 10 nationally for structurally deficient bridges as a percentage of total bridge inventory, according to the ARTBA.\n\nIt's a statewide problem that may require a new approach, Gov. Kelly Armstrong says, because \"there is no way a local county can repair every bridge they have — especially in rural counties.\" Some money exists for repairs, the governor said, but there just won't be enough to fix all of the structures on the ever-growing list of projects.\n\nPerhaps a better plan, according to Armstrong, is to rethink the state's bridge grid.\n\n\"I think eventually the state and (affected) counties are going to have to work out what a 21st-century infrastructure looks like,\" he said.\n\nBecause of the evolving way North Dakotans live and do business, the state could probably do with fewer bridges, he believes.\n\n\"You wouldn't build the bridge infrastructure the same way in 2025 that was done in 1925. Nobody's making a living on a quarter-section of land anymore; farming's an economy of scale. Some of this is, replace the ones you need,\" Armstrong said. \"You're going to have to make some tough decisions, particularly if you're someone that lives on the north side of that bridge or the south side of that bridge and now has to go 6 miles out of their way.\"\n\nIn northeast North Dakota, where numerous streams and rivers make their way into the north-flowing Red River, the number of bridges needing repair is especially high. For example, three of the top four most-traveled structurally deficient bridges in the state are in Grand Forks County, according to the ARTBA national report.\n\nAtop the list is the Kennedy Bridge, which carries traffic on U.S. Highway 2 across the Red River on the north edge of Grand Forks. No. 2 is the Interstate 29 bridge over Grand Forks' DeMers Avenue, followed by a Cass County highway over the Sheyenne River. At No. 4 is a rural I-29 bridge over County Drain No. 11, also near Grand Forks.\n\nThe long list of bridge repairs in the immediate Grand Forks area is enough to add a certain edge to Nick West's job as Grand Forks County engineer.\n\n\"It's a little stressful,\" West said. \"But it's also rewarding when you can fix them.\"\n\nAs reported in 2024 by the Herald, Grand Forks County has the most locally owned bridges of any county in the state, at 284. Of those, the county owns somewhere around 250 — the number changes every year, West said. He keeps a list of bridges that are most worthy of attention and tackles a portion of the list each year.\n\nGrand Forks County Administrator Tom Ford says West is \"passionate about his job.\"\n\n\"He has a plan,\" Ford said, \"and he's doing an excellent job prioritizing what needs attention. But you fix a couple of bridges, and as you fix a couple, other ones still on the list are aging. You just take it a bridge at a time and culvert at a time and be as responsive as you can.\"\n\nThe end goal, Ford said, is to repair and fix the people's infrastructure, \"but we can only address what the budget allows,\" he said.\n\nWest, Ford said, probably feels like he's playing \"Whac-A-Mole,\" the old carnival game in which players use a mallet to try to strike fake moles as they poke their heads from holes in a cabinet. As one mole dives into a hole, another arises elsewhere on the board. Over time, the game has become a metaphor for attempting to complete a nearly impossible and frustrating task.\n\nTo reduce the number of moles on the board — or in a real sense, the bridges on the list — funding will always be the hurdle, Armstrong, West and Ford all say.\n\n\"I'd be lying to you if I said there's enough (funding) to fix them all,\" Armstrong said, adding that fixing all of the bridges \"shouldn't be the goal\" if the state someday does rethink its bridge infrastructure.\n\nSo-called Prairie Dog funding — dollars derived from oil and gas tax revenues — has been used successfully for bridge repairs, West said. Operation Prairie Dog was created in 2019 as House Bill 1066, which made changes to oil and gas production tax distribution formula.\n\nThe bill's passage provided a \"new source of infrastructure funding for cities, counties and townships in non-oil-producing counties and airports throughout the state,\" according to a description on the North Dakota Treasurer's Office website. It allocates up to $250 million of oil and gas tax revenue per biennium to three buckets: municipal infrastructure, county and township infrastructure, and airport infrastructure.\n\nMore state money is coming, Armstrong noted.\n\n\"We did some things at the legislative session where they moved more money directly to (the Department of Transportation) through (percent of market value), and it allows for more money to be used locally, for more county projects,\" he said.\n\nDuring his January budget address, Armstrong touched on the state's infrastructure concerns.\n\n\"We have construction needs, and our budget addresses them head-on,\" he said during the speech.\n\nHe proposed a $464 million bonding package to tackle big projects like a new State Hospital in Jamestown; airport projects in Grand Forks, Dickinson and Fargo; and a military gallery at the North Dakota Heritage Center.\n\n\"To repay these bonds, we propose increasing the percent of market value, or POMV, which is applied to the Legacy Fund to calculate the earnings available for use every two years,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nAt the time, the POMV was 7% of the average five-year balance of the Legacy Fund, he said. Armstrong suggested a 1.5% increase, half of which to be used for repaying the bonds for the hospital, airport and Heritage Center projects, with the other half to be used to support state and local infrastructure projects.\n\nThe Legislature did not go along with the 1.5% increase to a full 8.5%, but did approve increasing the POMV to 8%. A portion of the increase — 30% — will be used for highway infrastructure projects.\n\nStill, the governor says, it's important to think about what future travel trends hold for state infrastructure.\n\n\"The reality is, our job is to get (the state's ag products) from farm to market as quickly as possible. What that looks like and what that future looks like is probably different than what people have lived (throughout the years),\" Armstrong said. \"We'll fix some of them, (but) there's no way we're going to be able to fix them all.\"\n\nPrairie Business Editor Carrie McDermott contributed to this report.",

    "News_text":"itsinmyownuniverse\/TikTok\n\nMariah, a solo traveler in Iran, needed to figure out how to get home after the country was bombed by Israel on June 13\n\nShe traveled with her guide and a driver who took her to the border and got her to Armenia\n\nFrom Armenia, she traveled to Cyprus, London, Orlando, Fla. and then finally got home after a week\n\nOne solo American traveler is sharing what it was like to be in Tehran, Iran, as the country's conflict with Israel escalated.\n\nMariah, who goes by the username @itsinmyownuniverseon TikTok, was a week into her travels in Iran when Israel launched a new wave of strikes, bombing Tehran and other areas in the country. It was the last day in Iran, and she found herself unable to leave; all the flights were canceled, and the border was closed. Mariah talks with PEOPLE exclusively about how she made it home.\n\n\"I was trying to figure out what am I going to do? How do I get out of here? My visa also only had a short amount of time on it, and there wasn't time to figure out what to do,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"I was also trying to ensure that the government didn't perceive me as a threat.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department recommends that Americans avoid the nation, warning on its website not to \"travel to Iran due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens, and wrongful detention.\"\n\nAccording to the State Department, \"Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran.\" These groups, including ISIS, have claimed responsibility for bombings and acts of terrorism.\n\nitsinmyownuniverse\/TikTok\n\nFollowing the initial bombings and Iran's retaliation against Israel, the United Stateslaunched airstrikestargeting Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure eight days later. On Monday, June 23, Iran retaliated against the U.S. military strikes, launching their ownmissile strikeagainst a military base in Qatar.\n\n\"The night before we started driving out to get to a border, I was able to hear the attacks going on,\" Mariah recalls. \"It was traumatizing because you're thinking, 'How close are they? Will it hit me? What's going on? Who is it affecting?' Being an American, I felt like I was in danger. I wanted to make sure I was not drawing attention to myself.\"\n\nMariah went to the embassy to figure out the best plan of action. Since there's no American embassy in Iran, her friends advised her to go to the Swiss Embassy, which assists American tourists. When she explained her situation to the man working there, he directed her to return to her hotel, as it was safer there.\n\nIran requires U.S. travelers to travel with a guide, so Mariah was using her guide's Wifi and hotspot to message her friends and family.\n\n\"I was preparing for the worst-case scenario,\" Mariah shares. \"I didn't know how long I would be there. I had one friend that I updated, and I was messaging two times a day, one in the morning, one in the evening.\"\n\n\"We made safe words in case anything happened to me, or I was taken, or my phone was taken,\" she adds. \"If this friend didn't hear anything from me within a certain amount of time, they were supposed to call my family, call the consulate and embassy, and tell them.\"\n\nAfter visiting the embassy, Mariah began searching for a driver who could take her to the border. She had to find a driver she could not only afford, but also one willing to drive an American.\n\nA driver saw her and offered to take her on the condition that she cover the cost needed for them to take the journey. Mariah's guide called the travel agency and initially told them they were traveling to Turkey. However, the agency reported back that they wouldn't be allowed into Turkey, so they had to change their plans and began heading toward Armenia.\n\nitsinmyownuniverse\/TikTok\n\n\"Once I made it to Armenia, my guide went in with me to speak Farsi to the people at the border. I was detained for about an hour,\" she says. \"They were asking me questions, making sure that I was legally allowed to be there, why I was there, and trying to find all of the documents.\"\n\nOnce she was allowed into Armenia, she realized that she had spent all her cash and still needed to get to the airport. She was able to hitchhike to the capital, where the airport is located, which is a six-hour drive.\n\nMariah says that when she got to the airport, she was able to book a flight to Cyprus. She flew from Cyprus to London, and then found a flight from London to Orlando, Fla. After touching down in the states, she flew from Orlando to her native North Carolina.\n\n\"After London, all of my flights were delayed at least six hours. I traveled for a week between trying to leave Iran and making it back to my hometown.\"\n\nitsinmyownuniverse\/TikTok\n\nMariah says there was no other option but to try to figure out how to get home.\n\n\"I don't know how I did it. I knew that I couldn't afford to be there any longer,\" she says. \"I spoke with my friends, who were able to help, and they would ask, 'What can we do to make sure that you get home safely?' \"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nDespite the unpredictable end to her trip, one of the things that stood out to her the most was \"the kindness of people\" when she was in Iran.\n\n\"They wanted to practice their English. They wanted to know what I thought of their country,\" she explains. \"Then, after the attack, my driver said to me, 'Our governments are against each other, but we're not. We're people, and you're no different than me and my children. You're just a person who wants to explore. I can appreciate you wanting to visit and see a new country.' \"\n\nBefore the bombings, Mariah was traveling through the country, visiting Shiraz, Yaz, Persepolis, Necropolis and Tehran, with the capital being the last location on her trip.\n\n\"I never got to see Tehran. I saw it at night for a little while, but it's beautiful, and there's a rich history and culture,\" Mariah shares. \"There's a story behind everything. I felt completely safe the entire time I was there, and even though my life was in danger, I was safe with the driver and the guide because if they were confident, I would make it to the border. They also wanted to get back to their family.\"\n\n\"The culture, the people, and the food are so good. Iran is really beautiful,\" she adds. \"It was nice that I got to see different parts of it.

    "News_title":"Opinion - Out of sight, out of mind: Without federal support, brain injury survivors will be left behind",
    "News_text":"Unlike a broken bone, a brain injury is often invisible.\n\nWe can’t see the cognitive struggles, the lost memories or the chronic pain. But for millions of Americans with brain injury, the impact is lifelong and profound. Every day is an exercise in rebuilding your life, your relationships and future.\n\nFederal programs have made the journey of life with brain injury a bit more manageable. But now, that support is under serious threat.\n\nBudget proposals and the Office of Management and Budget’sleaked passback documentoutline catastrophic cuts to health programs across the board. Among them: the elimination of nearly every federal initiative supporting people with brain injuries.\n\nDecades of investment in prevention and treatment could vanish with the stroke of a pen. These programs aren’t wasteful spending. They are an important investment for people living with brain injury — now and in the future.\n\nThese proposed cuts would dismantle the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s HEADS UP program, which trains coaches, parents and athletes to recognize concussions before they cause permanent damage. They would collapse the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems, the nation’s gold standard for providing care and advancing recovery for survivors with moderate to severe brain injuries. We would also lose the National Concussion Surveillance System and end the collection of critical data showing where injuries are happening and how many lives are at risk.\n\nFunding cuts for these programs put all of us at risk. Funding cuts mean a teenage football player sustains a preventable second concussion because his school had no access to proper return-to-play guidelines. A veteran with a blast injury loses access to a rehabilitation specialist trained to address cognitive impairments. Families already stretched thin by caregiving responsibilities lose the tiny but crucial grants that kept their loved ones living independently at home.\n\nBrain injury does not just happen to “other people.” More than64 million Americanshave sustained at least one traumatic brain injury (TBI) in their lifetime and millions have suffered from non-traumatic brain injuries like stroke, aneurysm or a lack of oxygen.\n\nFederal investment in brain injury research and care is modest. In 2024,TBI research funding was an estimated $194 million, which is just $3.03 per person living with a TBI — barely the cost of a cup of coffee. That figure pales in comparison to the estimated $76.5 billion annual cost of TBI in the United States for emergency care, hospitalization, lost productivity, disability and social services.\n\nCutting these programs isn’t fiscal responsibility. It’s public health malpractice.\n\nEliminating programs like HEADS UP, the National Concussion Surveillance System and the Core State Injury Prevention Program will roll back decades of progress. These cuts will create a world where more people are suffering from the effects of brain injury, and we will have a lessened ability to identify and help those in need. It is not realistic to assume that states will be able to pick up the cost of these programs, so many will likely go away with no backup plan for continuity.\n\nThis should not be a political issue.\n\nFor decades, programs that support brain injury prevention, research and treatment have received bipartisan support because the need for them is undeniable. Brain injuries don’t discriminate by party, race, income or geography. Brain injury can strike suddenly — a slip on the ice, a collision on the field, a car crash, a roadside bomb in combat — and alter lives forever.\n\nBrain injury should be thought of as a chronic health condition. Many survivors struggle with persistent effects such as memory loss, depression, behavioral changes and physical disabilities, which can quietly erode their ability to work, study or maintain relationships. Worse, brain injury dramatically increases the risk of developing devastating conditions later in life, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and stroke.\n\nWithout continued research, education and community-based supports, many survivors will simply fall through the cracks. Eliminating federal brain injury programs would worsen these public health crises while stripping hope from those who need it most.\n\nThe Brain Injury Association of America calls on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. We urge Congress to reject these devastating cuts to brain injury programs.\n\nInvesting in brain injury services and research saves lives, saves money and upholds America’s promise to care for its most vulnerable citizens. America made that promise decades ago, when it began building the vital network of programs that exist today. That promise must not be broken now. Not when so many lives and futures depend on it.\n\nRick Willis is president and CEO of the Brain Injury Association of America.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_title":"Kerrville didn’t have weather sirens used by other cities",
    "News_text":"AUSTIN (KXAN) – At a Friday news conference, Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said he “can’t answer” why camps weren’t evacuated but acknowledged: “We do not have a warning system.”\n\n“We didn’t know this flood was coming,” Kelly told reporters. “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming. We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States and we deal with floods on a regular basis. When it rains, we get water. We had no reason to believe that this was going to be anything like what’s happened here. None whatsoever.”\n\nNicole Wilson, 42, watched the news conference from her home in San Antonio and was “blown away.” Wilson told KXAN two of her friends have daughters that were at Camp Mystic and one had a son at Camp La Junta. All three children are accounted for. One of the girl’s cousins, however, is still missing, she said.\n\n“Just not having those plans in place is crazy to think about,” she said.  “That they wouldn’t have risk mitigation in place when you’re surrounded by water.”\n\nConflicting officials, social posts leave evacuation delay questions in Kerr County flooding\n\nWhile the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings and the city of Kerrville’s Facebook paged warned to “move to higher ground immediately,” the young campers at Camp Mystic likely wouldn’t have seen that since cell phones, smart watches, iPads and anything with Wi-Fi capability were considered “unacceptable electronic devices” to bring and “not allowed,” according to a recentlist of instructionssent to parents.\n\nCamp Mystic is located less than 20 miles west of Kerrville in Hunt, which is in Kerr County.\n\nWilson was born and raised in Kentucky, where she said outdoor weather sirens – primarily used for tornadoes – were common. On July 5, she started aChange.org online petition“urgently” calling for Kerrville and Kerr County to implement an outdoor early warning siren system for life-threatening emergencies, like flooding. So far, she said she’s received “a lot of positive feedback on that.”\n\n“The tragic events at Camp Mystic and the devastating flooding along the Guadalupe River that happened in July are stark reminders that severe weather can strike with little notice,” Wilson wrote. “A well-placed siren system will provide critical extra minutes for families, schools, camps, businesses, and visitors to seek shelter and evacuate when needed. This is not just a wish – it is a necessary investment in public safety.”\n\nIndeed, outdoor weather alert systems are not required by any federal or state law. The choice is left up to local leaders. On Friday morning, less than 20 miles from Kerrville, emergency sirens blasted in the unincorporated Kendall County community of Comfort, according toa published report, signaling “emergency conditions and a mandatory evacuation” as the Guadalupe River continued to rise. Sirens are typically activated by city or county officials, according to the NWS.\n\n“I just think if they had five minutes [of warning time from a siren] longer, five to 10 minutes longer, and that’s what those sirens give you …. and you know the counselors would have led them uphill …I don’t believe we’d be in the scenario right now where we’re searching for those girls,” said Wilson.\n\nCities that use sirens, like San Marcos — which has14 outdoor weather sirens to warn of floods, tornadoes and wildfires— have previously touted the outdoor warning system as a“vital tool”for emergency preparedness. The sirens, called an Outdoor Warning System, are designed to quickly and loudly notify a community of threats to public safety, including severe weather. San Marcos notes its sirens emit unique sound patterns for different emergencies. Critics say they can be expensive, require regular maintenance, are primarily designed to be heard outdoors and aren’t as effective as weather radios and mobile alerts. A single siren can cost anestimated $10,000 to $50,000and multiple are sometimes needed.\n\nAustin doesn’t have a city-wide outdoor weather siren system. In 2022, a cityspokespersontold KXANthe fastest way to get information out is with “the technology we have today” and there was a concern that sirens could “cause confusion.”\n\nThis past legislative session,lawmakers filed a billthat would have created a council to operate a grant program assisting local governments with acquiring emergency communications equipment. One of its tasks, if the bill had passed, would have been to develop a statewide strategic plan that included “the use of outdoor warning sirens.” The council would have also been asked to “develop and implement, as advisable, emergency alert systems and incorporate as necessary communication technologies into the emergency communications network of this state.”\n\nIn 2018, Kerr County, along with the Upper Guadalupe River Authority, applied for a $1 million grant for a flood warning system.\n\n“That application was not selected, okay. That’s the bad news,” a commissioner said, according to Kerr County commissioner meeting minutes at the time.\n\nTwo years later, in 2020, according to Kerr County meeting minutes, that same commissioner said: “We’ve been trying to get a new flood warning system here.”\n\nThe 2020 commissioner meeting is when Kerr County implementedIPAWS, or Integrated Public Alert & Warning System through FEMA, which is a free program offered through Kerr County’s existing contract withCodeRed, a system it currently uses for mass emergency pre-recorded emergency telephone messages, according toKerr County’s website.The CodeRed system isalso used in Kerrvillewith the caveat that it relies on White Pages data and residents should not “assume their number is included.”\n\nAs of 2023, Kerr County Commissioners’ Court meeting minutes show the county was still discussing grant options for flood mitigation assistance to include research on engineering and infrastructure for flood prevention measures.\n\nIn aninterview with the New York Times, Kelly said one reason Kerr County doesn’t have a flood warning system is due to the cost.\n\n“Taxpayers won’t pay for it,” Kelly is quoted as saying.\n\nAsked if residents might reconsider now, he responded: “I don’t know.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"As temperatures soar across much of the U.S., one creature is crawling into the spotlight, and sometimes, into homes. Scorpions, the desert-dwelling arachnids armed with pincers and venomous tails, are showing up more frequently in residential areas. But experts say the fear might be overblown.\n\nWhile they look like something straight out of a horror movie, most scorpions in the U.S. aren’t dangerous to humans. According to Jacob Gorneau, a researcher at the California Academy of Sciences, these creatures are shy predators that typically sting only when threatened, usually by accident,USA Todayreported.\n\n“They’re very unwilling to strike unless they feel like their life is in danger,” Gorneau said.\n\nScorpions are most often associated with the desert Southwest—Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas—but they’ve also been spotted as far north as Virginia on the East Coast and southern Canada on the West.\n\nAnd while some scorpions can handle hot, tropical environments, Gorneau explained that many are surprisingly adaptable. “Even in places where it snows, they’ll burrow deep enough to create a microenvironment that suits them,” he said.\n\nWhat’s driving them into homes? Heat. Extreme temperatures push scorpions to seek cooler, shaded spaces, like basements, bathrooms, or anywhere they can sneak in through pipes, cracks, or under doors. They’re also on the hunt for food and moisture, which makes homes an accidental oasis.\n\nThough there are nearly 3,000 known species of scorpions, only one in the U.S., the Arizona bark scorpion, is considered truly dangerous. The rest? Their stings usually hurt about as much as a bee sting, if that.\n\nStill, it’s not exactly comforting to find one in your shoe. Prevention tips include sealing entry points, clearing clutter, and keeping your yard trimmed. And if you do come face to face with a scorpion, know that it’s probably more afraid of you.\n\n“They’ve been around for hundreds of millions of years,” Gorneau said. “They haven’t changed much because they haven’t had to. Their bodies and habits just work.”\n\nSo before you reach for the nearest shoe, remember: the surprising truth is that these creepy crawlers are more Goldilocks than gladiator.\n\nRelated: Experts Sound the Alarm on New Invasion Threatening Christmas Tree Farms\n\nSurprising Truth About the Scorpions Creeping Into Your Homefirst appeared on Men's Journal on Jul 5, 2025",

    "News_title":"A boy in Gaza with brain damage fights for his life amid blockade",
    "News_text":"BEIRUT (AP) — It’s as if the whole weight ofIsrael’s war in Gazahas fallen on Amr al-Hams. The 3-year-old has shrapnel in his brain from an Israeli strike on his family's tent. His pregnant mother was killed. His father is paralyzed by grief over the death of his longtime sweetheart.\n\nNow the boy is lying in a hospital bed, unable to speak, unable to move, losing weight, while doctors don’t have the supplies to treat his brain damage or help in his rehabilitationafter a weekslong blockadeand constant bombardment.\n\nRecently out of intensive care, Amr’s frail body twists in visible pain. His wide eyes dart around the room. His aunt is convinced he’s looking for his mother. He can’t speak, but she believes he is trying to say “mom.”\n\n“I am trying as much as I can. It is difficult,” said his aunt Nour al-Hams, his main caregiver, sitting next to him on the bed in Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza. “What he is living through is not easy.”\n\nTo reassure him, his aunt sometimes says his mother will be back soon. Other times, she tries to distract him, handing him a small ball.\n\nThe war has decimated the health system\n\nThe war began Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people captive. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed over 57,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says women and children make up most of the dead but does not specify how many were fighters or civilians.\n\nNearly 21 months into the conflict that displaced the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million people, it is nearly impossible for the critically wounded to get the care they need, doctors and aid workers say.\n\nThe health care sector has been decimated: Nearly half of the territory’s 36 hospitals have been put out of service. Daily bombings and strikes overwhelm the remaining facilities, which are operating only partially. They struggle with shortages of anything from fuel, gauze and sutures to respirators or scanners that have broken down and can’t be replaced.\n\nIsraeli forces have raided and besieged medical facilities, claiming Hamas militants have used them as command centers. Doctors have been killed or were displaced, unable to reach hospitals because of continued military operations.\n\nFor more than 2 1\/2 months,Israel blockedall food, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza, accusing Hamas of siphoning off aid to fund its military activities, though the U.N. said there was no systematic diversion. The population was pushed toward famine.\n\nSince mid-May, Israel has allowed in a trickle of aid, including medical supplies.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry estimates that 33,000 children have been injured during the war, including 5,000 requiring long-term rehabilitation and critical care. Over 1,000 children, like Amr, are suffering from brain or spinal injuries or amputated limbs.\n\n“Gaza will be dealing with future generations of kids living with all sorts of disabilities, not just brain, but limb disabilities that are consequences of amputation that could have been prevented if the health system was not under the pressures it is under, wasn’t systematically targeted and destroyed as it was,” said Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive care specialist who has volunteered multiple times in Gaza with international medical organizations.\n\nA fateful journey north\n\nIn April, one week before her due date, Amr’s mother, Inas, persuaded her husband to visit her parents in northern Gaza. They trekked from the tent they lived in on Gaza’s southern coast to the tent where her parents live.\n\nThey were having an evening meal when the strike hit. Amr’s mother and her unborn baby, his grandfather and his brother and sister were killed.\n\nAmr was rushed to the ICU at Indonesian Hospital, the largest in northern Gaza. A scan confirmed shrapnel in his brain and reduced brain function. A breathing tube was inserted into his throat.\n\n“He is 3. Why should he bear the weight of a rocket?\" his aunt asked.\n\nHis father, Mohammed, was too stunned to even visit the ICU. His wife had been the love of his life since childhood, the aunt said. He barely spoke.\n\nDoctors said Amr needed advanced rehabilitation. But while he was at the hospital, Israeli forces attacked the facility — encircling its premises and causing damage to its communication towers, water supplies and one of its wards. Evacuation orders were issued for the area, and patients were transferred to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.\n\nAnother treacherous journey\n\nBut Shifa was overwhelmed with mass casualties, and staff asked the family to take Amr south, even though no ambulances or oxygen tanks could be spared.\n\nThe father and aunt had to take Amr, fresh out of ICU with the tube in his throat, in a motorized rickshaw for the 25-kilometer (15-mile) drive to Nasser Hospital.\n\nAmr was in pain, his oxygen levels dropped. He was in and out of consciousness. “We were reading the Quran all along the road,” said his aunt, praying they would survive the bombings and Amr the bumpy trip without medical care.\n\nAbout halfway, an ambulance arrived. Amr made it to Nasser Hospital with oxygen blood levels so low he was again admitted to ICU.\n\nUnable to get the care he needs\n\nStill, Nasser Hospital could not provide Amr with everything he needed. Intravenous nutrients are not available, Nasser’s head of pediatrics, Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, said. Thefortified milkAmr needed disappeared from the market and the hospital after weeks of Israel’s blockade. He has lost about half his weight.\n\nWhen he came out of the ICU, Nour shared his bed with him at night and administered his medication. She grinds rice or lentils into a paste to feed him through a syringe connected to his stomach.\n\n“We have starvation in Gaza. There is nothing to eat,” said his aunt, who is a trained nurse. “There is nothing left.”\n\nThe care Amr has missed is likely to have long-term effects. Immediate care for brain injuries is critical, Haj-Hassan said, as is follow-up physical and speech therapy.\n\nSince the Israeli blockade on Gaza began in March, 317 patients, including 216 children, have left the territory for medical treatment alongside nearly 500 of their companions, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOver 10,000 people, including 2,500 children, await evacuation.\n\nAmr is one of them.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of civilian affairs in Gaza, coordinates medical evacuations after receiving requests from countries that will take the patients and security screenings. In recent weeks, over 2,000 patients and their companions have left for treatment, COGAT said, without specifying the time period.\n\nTess Ingram, spokesperson for the U.N. children’s agency, said the only hope for many critically injured who remain in Gaza is to get out. Countries need to “open their hearts, open their doors and open their hospitals to children who survived the unimaginable and are now languishing in pain,\" she said.\n\nAmr's aunt reads his every move. He is unhappy with his diapers, she said. He outgrew them long ago. He was a smart kid, now he cries “feeling sorry for himself,” said Nour. He gets seizures and needs tranquilizers to sleep.\n\n“His brain is still developing. What can they do for him? Will he be able to walk again?\" Nour asked. “So long as he is in Gaza, there is no recovery for him.”",

    "News_title":"Midnight Hammer was the second-longest bombing mission: The B-2 also flew the longest",
    "News_text":"Operation Midnight Hammer sawB-2 Spirit stealth bombersfly from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri to strike nuclear facilities in Iran. The 37-hour round trip made it the second-longest bombing mission in history. But if you ain’t first, you’re last.\n\nLuckily for the B-2’s record, it also flew the longest bombing mission over two decades earlier.\n\nOn the evening of October 7, 2001, less than a month after the terrorist attacks on 9\/11, the second wave of B-2s launched from Whiteman to strike targets in Afghanistan. Along withB-52 Stratofortress bombers, the B-2s were tasked with destroying Taliban air defense positions in order to secure air superiority. Flying a B-2 named “The Spirit of America” were Brian “Jethro” Neal and Mel “Sideshow” Deaile, who recounted the mission in a2014 USO article.\n\nFor security reasons, the bombers took the long way west across the Pacific Ocean to Afghanistan. In 2025, decoy bombers would fly this direction for Operation Midnight Hammer while the actual strike force flew east across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAfter four hours in the air, The Spirit of America rendezvoused with aKC-135 aerial tankerfor midair refueling. Four hours after that, the bomber refueled again over Hawaii. Between refuelings, Neal and Deaile took turns catching some sleep on a modified cot behind their ejection seats. Service members like to give the Air Force grief, but soldiers have set up personal tents with more space than the cockpit of the B-2.\n\nThe bomber refueled three more times: over Guam, through the Straits of Malacca, and over the Indian Ocean near Diego Garcia. Turning north, The Spirit of America followed the coast of India up to Afghanistan. With the flight across the Pacific taking over 24 hours, the airmen were issued a “pick me up pill,” which Neal and Deaile took as they approached the coast of Pakistan. Additionally, many of the targets designated for the bomber had changed since it departed from Whiteman AFB. As a result, the majority of the 16 JDAM bombs aboard the B-2 had to be reprogrammed for new targets.\n\nREAD:Watch this Spirit decimate an airfield with 80 JDAMs\n\nAfter making the trip for the longest bombing mission, The Spirit of America spent about two hours over Afghanistan, hitting targets with precision strikes. Not that the Taliban had a sophisticated air defense network, but the first indications of the flying Dorito overhead would have been the impacts of its JDAMs. As they left Afghan airspace and headed for a tanker, Neal and Deaile were contacted by the Air Operations Center with a follow-on mission for their four remaining JDAMs. Since they weren’t being paid to come home with bombs, the two airmen refueled over the Arabian Sea and flew back to Afghanistan.\n\nAfter striking the identified target, Neal and Deaile exited Afghanistan again after 90 minutes. Four hours and another midair refuel later, they approached Diego Garcia. But the hits kept coming for the two pilots as the B-52 that landed ahead of them declared an emergency. This forced The Spirit of America to go around and delay its landing. 44.3 hours after taking off from Missouri, Neal and Deaile were finally able to touch down in Diego Garcia.\n\nWhile the mission was over for the pilots, the bomber wasn’t done yet. With the engines still running, oil and a new crew of two were brought aboard, and The Spirit of America flew another 30 hours back to Missouri. Along with five other B-2s, the bomber operated for over 70 hours nonstop. None of the planes malfunctioned or suffered engine trouble during the three-day marathon. At a unit cost of $2.13 billion, such performance is expected of the B-2.\n\nBetween the opening blows of Operation Enduring Freedom and the historic bombing run of Operation Midnight Hammer, theB-21 Raiderhas big, stealthy shoes to fill.\n\nWe Are The Mighty is a celebration of military service, with a mission to entertain, inform, and inspire those who serve and those who support them.

    "News_title":"Charles Clarke interview: ‘We need a much more aggressive approach to illegal migration’",
    "News_text":"“Do I miss politics?” asks Charles Clarke. “If it was put to me that I could become a minister – I can’t envisage that, of course, at 74 – I would consider it. I believe in politics deeply.”\n\nThe formerLabourhome secretary has a soft, almost gentle, voice. Leaning on a table in the back garden of a small terraced house in Cambridge he seems every inch a typical grandfather, flanked by plant pots, a busy bird bath and a rose-heavy wooden trellis. It is the hottest day of the year so far and we have slipped through the narrow kitchen to sit outside in the shade. He looks the same as he did in 2005, with that wrap of white whiskers you could strike a match on, back when he was one of Tony Blair’s “big beasts” tackling crime and immigration.\n\nTwenty years ago, Clarke was at the Home Office during theworst home-grown terrorist attack in our country’s history, when four jihadist suicide bombers killed themselves and 52 other people on the London Underground and a double-decker bus. Clarke co-ordinated the response of the emergency and security services on that terrible day, taking decisions few politicians ever had to face.\n\n“Ever since 9\/11, terror had been on the agenda, and we were considering potential threats,” he says. “It was a constant theme. But there was no particular terror threat on my desk the day before the attacks.\n\n“At around 9am on Thursday July 7, we were sitting in the Cabinet Room for a regular meeting chaired by [deputy PM] John Prescott because the prime minister was in Gleneagles for a G8 summit.”\n\nIt was cool and overcast for July, but since it was the morning after the announcement that London had won the bid to host the 2012 Olympics, the city was glowing with a joyful – in some cases literal – hangover.\n\n“I was handed a message saying there had been an accident on the London Underground. Then another came in two minutes later that it might be an explosion. I felt deep shock. Everyone was in shock.\n\n“I asked John if we could postpone the Cabinet meeting so I could chair [the emergency committee] Cobra. We needed a detailed situation report. Some ministers had heard there had been eight explosions, but we found out that was because there was smoke coming out from two sides of the Tube tunnels. Andy Hayman [then assistant commissioner of the Met Police], who was the senior police officer, gave us a very accurate account of what was taking place.\n\n“The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, and I discussed closing down the entire public transport system, but we decided not to. It would be too disruptive – plus it would be a victory for the attackers. Large parts of the Tube were already shut down.”\n\nThree bombs detonated on London Underground trains at around 8.50am: at Aldgate and Edgware Road on the Circle line and in the deep tunnel at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line. An hour later, a fourth bomber blew up the upper deck of a number 30 bus in Tavistock Square.\n\n“The principal question was would there be another attack. I had to authorise Operation Kratos, which was the police shoot-to-kill policy. It was not clear for several hours that these had been suicide attacks. We didn’t know if there were bombers at large.\n\n“We briefed Tony [Blair] in Scotland, but he wanted to come back to London, which is what I would have done if I’d been in his position.”\n\nMemories of the Madrid train bombs in 2004 that killed 193 people haunted the British authorities: in Madrid the explosions were caused by bombs planted by the perpetrators, with further devices found later on the same day. In London, before it became clear that suicide bombers were responsible for the July 7 attacks, officials feared that the bombers might still be at large and preparing further attacks. Given the nature of previous attacks abroad, however, Whitehall had prepared for the worst.\n\n“There were a set of protocols on command structures and who would take the decisions in any given circumstance. I had been involved in war gaming for such situations. The most dramatic of these was to give authorisation for a passenger plane to be shot down if it was doing what had happened on 9\/11. Somebody had to decide whether to shoot down a plane if it was about to crash into the Houses of Parliament.” That individual would have been Clarke or Blair, but thankfully the decision was never needed.\n\nAside from the bombers, 52 people of 18 nationalities were killed and around 770 were injured.\n\nIt was the first Islamist terror attack on British soil. “I was exhausted as we got towards the end of the day, but the adrenalin was massive. What I kept asking was, ‘Have I done the best I possibly can to deal with this?’ I was confident we had dealt well with what had happened, but my worry was we hadn’t identified a further attack.”\n\nThree of the jihadists, Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and Hasib Hussain, 18, had driven down from Leeds. All were British-born with Pakistani heritage. At Luton, they met the fourth attacker, a Jamaican-born Muslim convert, Germaine Lindsay, 19. Together they took a train to King Cross, and then dispersed into London’s public transport network with backpacks filled with home-made hydrogen-peroxide-based explosives.\n\nTheir identities, methods and motives were revealed in the days that followed, with videos made by Khan and Tanweer claiming they were “soldiers” retaliating against Western action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and elsewhere. When Tanweer declared “this is only the beginning”, he was half right.\n\nTwo weeks later, on July 21, three more jihadists attempted a second wave of attacks on the London Underground and a fourth on another bus, this time the number 26 at Haggerston. “With each day that passed after the first attacks, it was tempting to think ‘Have we avoided more?’” says Clarke. “So when it came, it was a terrible feeling. The idea that it was coming back was a doom-laden moment.”\n\nIncredibly, all four devices failed to detonate, and the would-be bombers went on the run. Although they were eventually caught in dramatic fashion – one police raid being broadcast live on television – the relief that London had been spared further carnage was offset by the tragic shooting of the Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes by police at Stockwell station the day after the failed bombings. He had been mis-identified as Hussain Oman, one of the failed bombers.\n\n“What happened to Jean Charles de Menezes was horrendous, and there was very justified anger from his family. But I never felt – and I don’t to this day – that the police were behaving incorrectly. Just as I never felt I was wrong to authorise the shoot-to-kill policy [used by the officers who shot Menezes], because I felt it was my duty. I could be wrong and I can be criticised for it, but I never thought we had done the wrong thing. I’ve never been in favour of scapegoating the police.”\n\nThat fortnight was a colossal jolt. It left no doubt in the public’s mind – let alone the government’s – that Islamist terror could strike at the heart of the nation. Here were small cells of impressionable young British-born men inspired by al-Qaeda and motivated by an anti-Western agenda.\n\nIn the years since, Britain has endured more Islamist violence, among others: the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013; the Westminster Bridge car attack in 2017 that killed six; the London Bridge attack the same year in which eight people were killed by knifemen in a van; the London Bridge stabbing in 2019 that cost two others their lives; and the murder of Conservative MP Sir David Amess in 2021. But for Clarke, it is the Manchester Arena attack of 2017,in which a suicide bomber killed 22 children and parents at an Ariana Grande concert, which is most emblematic of the poisonous motives behind Islamist terror.\n\n“It was an attack on the way we in the West see our liberty,” he says. “They want to destroy our society. I can’t see any compromise with Islamic terrorism.”\n\nClarke’s robust language as he reflects on the horrors of July 7 has a consistency lacking from some current members of his own party, as Labour struggles to cope withthose on the Left who are ambivalent about whether Hamas militants are terroristsand question the British authorities’ attempts to tackle extremism.\n\n“We’ve all been deeply affected by July 7. It made me a harder person. [Afterwards] I was very much less tolerant of people who say, ‘Give people who think like this a chance’. I don’t think I’d go as far to say I have no concern for their civil liberties, but it’s a pretty low concern.\n\n“I believe respect and tolerance is very important, and attacks on that come from many directions. Anyone who tries to foment hate has to be confronted very directly. I’m still in favour of the deportation of foreign nationals who promote terrorism.”\n\nClarke was head boy at the fee-paying Highgate School in North London, but only “found” politics while studying mathematics and economics at Cambridge in the late 1970s. “I was brought up to believe you could and should commit to public service,” he says.\n\nHis father, Richard Clarke, had been a permanent secretary at the Treasury between 1962-66 and originally came to London from Derbyshire, while his mother, who was also a civil servant, was from Weardale, County Durham: “We weren’t a very Labour family, but we were a public service family.”\n\nAfter completing his stint as president of the Cambridge Student Union in 1977, and a year spent in Cuba for the World Youth Festival, he became a councillor in Hackney in East London. “I was chair of housing in Hackney,” he says, which by 1981 was facing demands from central government to cap its rates. “It was a tough time, with people living in real poverty and housing estates that had been ignored and declining.”\n\nFollowing Labour’s disastrous defeat in 1983, Clarke worked as a researcher and then chief of staff for its new leader, Neil Kinnock. It was during this period his belief in “pragmatism with a purpose” began to crystallise.\n\n“Labour came out of deep conflict in the 1980s. There was factional hatred with people who said ‘Either you are with us or you are a class traitor’. In 1983 there was a real sense Labour might be finished. Just as the Conservatives face today – they must ask themselves what they stand for. My view was we should be looking to the future. We needed to speak to society as it was in the 1980s, not the 1940s. Pragmatism was seen as a terrible word.”\n\nClarke set up a political consultancy firm after Labour’s fourth successive election defeat in 1992, but his beliefs dovetailed with that of the leadership under Blair, who took over in 1994. Clarke was unable to resist seeking his place among the wave of new MPs elected in 1997.\n\n“Politics is like a drug. After 1992 I felt there were so many distasteful and problematic aspects to it. But within a year I started to think about finding a seat. Once you’ve got the bug, the idea of wanting to change society is a gripping thing.”\n\nEven in the oppressive heat, amid the sounds of bumblebees the size of conkers hitting his garden wall, Clarke’s sharpness remains impressive. Perhaps it was this that convinced Blair to promote the MP for Norwich South to minister without portfolio in 2001, and then to education secretary in 2002, and finally, at the end of 2004, to one of the great – and most challenging – offices of state.\n\n“I never accepted that the Home Office is a poisoned chalice. There will always be the unexpected.” It was around this time that Clarke came to be seen as a “bruiser” – and a target for opposition MPs and campaign groups who feared he posed a threat to civil liberties.The Guardian’s cartoonist, Steve Bell, drew him as a rampaging elephant.\n\nClarke’s first task was to react to the Law Lords – before they were moved to the new Supreme Court in 2009 – striking down the counter-terror legislation of his predecessor, David Blunkett. The indefinite detention without trial of foreign terror suspects was judged to breach human rights laws at the end of 2004. Clarke set about putting “control orders” – a range of measures to monitor suspects – in place in response.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, Clarke found himself at the centre of a debate over the government’s role in protecting the public. In August 2005, the UN’s special investigator on torture expressed concerns about the UK’s government’s intention to return radical Islamic preachers to their countries of origin. Clarke’s response at the time was typical of the approach he adopted in the aftermath of the attacks. “The human rights of those people who were blown up in London on July 7 are, to be quite frank, more important than the human rights of the people who committed those acts.”\n\nFast-forward to this summer, and the issues over which Clarke fought his greatest political battles feel even more pressing. Successive Tory governments have pledged to reduce net immigration and consistently failed to do so. Questions persist about Britain’s ability to control its own borders and todeport foreign criminals and failed asylum seekers.\n\n“Immigration does not equal crime,” says Clarke. “But we should take a much harder line with countries who don’t agree to accept returns, and if they don’t co-operate, it should be harder for their citizens to get visas and for them to receive overseas aid.\n\n“We need a much more aggressive stance. If those people on the boats know they will be returned to their country of origin if their asylum claim fails, then they are less likely to take that journey. The length of time it takes to process asylum cases attacks public confidence. If we had tougher agreements with countries for returns, then we could circumvent some of the delays caused by the European Convention on Human Rights. I’ve never been in favour of withdrawing from the ECHR, but it needs reforming.”\n\nThe focus of any home secretary’s job was and remains crime and immigration. Central to these themes in 2005 was the government’s desire to introduce ID cards. Clarke was an advocate of the Identity Card Act, introduced in 2006 but not ready to be implemented until 2009. It was scrapped immediately by the Cameron-led coalition, amid claims from the Left and Right alike that it was “un-British”.\n\n“Theresa May made a massive theatre of literally smashing up the hard disc the data was stored on in 2010, but if the scheme had been kept, we would have had a far greater grip on immigration than we do now,” Clarke says.\n\n“If those people [coming on boats] knew they had to demonstrate their identity in order to get a job, benefits or somewhere to live, we’d be less of a target.”\n\nClarke saysthe rising popularity of Reformdemonstrates the failure of the mainstream parties to grasp the extent of public discontent.\n\n“Reform is entitled to exploit grievances – it’s a legitimate tactic. If the establishment fails to make itself worthy of people’s support, then it’s entitled to be kicked in the a--e. Farage is a talented creator of opinion, but I don’t think I’ve ever heard Reform articulate a clear vision of government. And I think politics is only worthy of respect when it’s about putting solutions to move things forward – and Reform has not passed that test, for me, so far.”\n\nLast week, Sir Keir Starmer marked the end of his first year in office with ahumiliating climbdown over welfare reform. Clarke clearly wants to avoid joining the ranks of Labour figures criticising the Prime Minister, but says, diplomatically: “This Labour Government has big difficulties with its communications. I think Keir Starmer has a vision, but he hasn’t developed a narrative of how he hopes to put that into effect.”\n\nClarke is, however, conscious that the coming years might be hugely consequential for democracy as we know it. “If people lose confidence in politicians, they will lose confidence in the whole of politics,” he says.\n\nFor someone described as a “bruiser”, Clarke is not particularly tall or broad, but his presence remains ever-so slightly intimidating. It’s not hard to imagine how he earned his reputation.\n\nHe enjoys his portfolio life – he’s been a visiting lecturer at Lancaster and East Anglia universities, an author, a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society and a supporter of Norwich City, though he doesn’t go to Carrow Road as often as he did when he was the local MP. Clarke declares himself a happy grandfather, with one son and his granddaughter in Southend, and his other son nearby in Cambridge.\n\nIn 1984 he married Carol Pearson, who he met when she was working in the House of Commons. His wife has been influential in perhaps the most important aspect of his public life since leaving Parliament: a resolve to promote the values of what we once breezily called the “West”, stiffened by the experiences of her Estonian family.\n\n“I have deep links with Estonia. My wife’s grandfather, August Maramaa, was mayor of a town called Viljandi. We have a great sense of pride in the family.”\n\nClarke set up a Baltics geopolitics programme at Cambridge University in 2021, and it’s ever more relevant since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine the following year, with countries once part of the Soviet Union waiting anxiously to see what Russia does next in regions it considers to be in its “sphere of influence”.\n\nIt’s not impossible to imagine Clarke returning to the political front line at a time when Britain faces domestic and overseas threats and the front benches lack figures with his eloquence and depth.\n\nHe is certainly the kind of individual you would want in a crisis, such as an attack by those who do not simply want to kill but to terrorise, as we saw 20 years ago.\n\n“I felt proud of the resilience, warmth and positivity of people that we saw after the attacks,” he says. “That is the strength of our country and I hate attempts to undermine it.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Readers and writers: Two books take clear-eyed view of health care system’s flaws",
    "News_text":"Two books that explore the deep flaws in our health care system are top of the pile today, along with fiction set from St. Paul’s Seventh Street to Vietnam. The authors are Minnesotans or have regional connections.\n\n“Because We Must”:by Tracy Youngblom (University of Massachusetts Press, $24.95)\n\nEntering his room, I also entered a new world, one that was shrouded in the unfamiliar: medical specialists and surgeons, sedatives and transfusions, trach and feeding tubes, changes in medications, therapies and difficult diagnoses, long-term care facilities and rehab centers, and Lord knows what else…after that first night, though a stranger there, I made that new world my home. I live there now, in the land of recovery. —from “Because We Must”\n\nTracy Youngblom’s heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful memoir of life after her son Elias’ car crash in 2015 is riveting reading as this Minnesota poet takes us into her family’s life. First, seeing her son lying so broken in the hospital, she wonders whether he will survive. He does, but head injuries lead to the young man’s blindness and a new way of navigating the world. Through medical crises and recovery, Youngblom was there for her son.\n\nOn the day of the crash Youngblom, was rushing to finish preparing for a class she was going to teach when she met a uniformed officer at her door, telling her Elias had been in an accident while driving home to Coon Rapids from Fargo. His car had been hit head-on by a drunk driver.\n\nYoungblom thought she was prepared for seeing her son in the hospital, but she wasn’t: “His head was swollen to an unrecognizable size, a small watermelon. Both of his eyes were swollen shut: his eyelids bulged, red and purple with bruising. Dark lines of stitches, along with bruises, crisscrossed his arms and his face, including one crooked, deep gash on his left cheek that met his mustachioed upper lip, twisting it upward…”\n\nThrough years of Elias’s rehab, learning Braille and finally living on his own, Youngblom was the one on whom Elias relied with resilience, grace and humor. His mother faced her own challenges about her marriage and religious faith as she fought for her son’s care and coordinated with other family members. Always she tried to strike a balance between wanting to protect Elias while also letting him lead his own life as he became an adult. Now he is married and lives in Fargo where he continues his passion for drum corps music.\n\nYoungblom will read in celebration of winning the University of Massachusetts Press Juniper Prize at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Magers & Quinn, 3038 Hennepin Ave. S., Mpls., in conversation with Lindsay Steffes, winner of the Juniper Prize for her novel “Gichigami.” The prize recognizes outstanding works of literary fiction.\n\n“Who Cares?: The real patient experience”:by Melisssa Winger (Independently published, $29.99)\n\nMelissa Winger has been a patient care advocate since 1997, undertaking the Herculean task of changing the nation’s health care system to one in which the patient is treated as a human being. Her memoir could be a companion to Youngblom’s because they had many of the same experiences under different circumstances.\n\nWinger was an 18-year-old single mother when she gave birth to Evan, who has a rare genetic disorder. He is nonverbal and has endured countless surgeries because of more than 30 medical issues. From the beginning, Winger tried to advocate for her child, but nobody took seriously a young mother who needed help. For instance, when Evan was hospitalized as a baby, trained professionals took care of complicated procedures such as dealing with a feeding tube. But when he was released, Winger was expected to do these procedures herself with no help.\n\nAlong with her personal experiences, Winger references studies from reputable organizations that show the twisted mass of regulations and paperwork that knot the vast world of health care, discussing patient safety, medical devices and prescriptions, testing, home care, medical records, emergency care, funding, patient and family-centered care, and vulnerable-adult abuse. Evan now has been diagnosed with acute kidney problems and Winger must continue her often-exhausting fights for the best care available for her son. This book is so fact-filled and clear-eyed that it should have been published by a major publishing house. It should be in the hands of all of us who are potential patients as well as medical professionals.\n\n“Backwashed”:by Pete Gallagher (Beaver’s Pond Press, $21.95)\n\nThere’s some kinkiness and lots of colorful characters in this novel set in and around St. Paul’s Seventh Street. The twisty plot is so complicated that it’s hard to know who is “playing” whom and why. The main characters are Dion Drury and his bisexual sister, who never learned why their father was killed and why their mother disappeared 20 years earlier. Dion works as a civilian employee of the St. Paul police impound lot at night, and his sister is a bartender at one of two restaurants that are important meeting places in the story. What happened to the siblings’ parents is being investigated by Kady L’Orient, a young cop drawn to Dion while trying to make a name for herself, as well as a police lieutenant with a damaged eye who’s the right-hand man and fixer for “the walrus,” a ward politician who talks like the encyclopedia and is not exactly ethical in his dealings. Add a corpse in the St. Paul sewer system, the sultry owner of one of the restaurants who’s married to the councilman, a big young tow truck driver whose dad was a house painter, and the piano-playing uncle with whom the siblings lived after their parents were gone, and you’ve got a juicy story of corruption, deal-making and secrets set in familiar places St. Paul readers will enjoy visiting:\n\n” ‘What can I say?’ Evan told her. ‘This is West Seventh Street. The truth takes a little while sometimes.’ ”\n\n“Escaping Limbo”:by Mike F. Elliott (Beaver’s Pond Press, $17.95)\n\nGrowing up Catholic in St. Paul is almost a literary subgenre, and former St. Paulite Elliott does it right in a coming-of-age story about Francis Paulson and his wild friend Izzy, set in 1968. While never belittling those who take their faith seriously, the author offers humor. For instance, the title comes from a confusing conversation his grieving mother has with the priest after she delivers a stillborn baby. The priest assures her the baby’s soul is “safe in limbo” but when he tries to explain this place, using a Thanksgiving feast as a metaphor, it ends up being about pumpkin pie. Francis, who tells the story looking back on what happened in one year, is an altar boy in the limbo of adolescence. He wants to help Izzy get over the death of his older brother, which has sent Izzy’s father into violent behavior. Meanwhile, Francis is saving money for a canoe trip to northern Minnesota with Izzy while defending his girlfriend Susan from Izzy’s insults. He’s also dealing with his little sister’s fascination with fire and missing his beloved grandmother, founder of the family’s candy factory. This tender story is a tribute to friendship and a young man questioning everything he was taught by his school’s nuns and priest. The author divides his time between Minnesota and Arizona.\n\n“Devil’s Thumb”:by Dan Jorgensen (Speaking Volumes LLC, $19.95)\n\nDevil’s Thumb is a rock outcropping in the Black Hills in this third novel by Jorgensen, set in 1925 in and around the mining town of Keystone where Gutzon Borglum is poised to begin carving four presidents’ faces on Mount Rushmore. This isn’t the Wild West anymore, but there’s crime. U.S. Marshal Al Twocrow, the only Native American lawman in the service, investigates two murders and a bootleg operation reported to be linked to gangster Al Capone. The plot is a tribute to women working in the area at the time, including a pilot who helps Twocrow when he needs swift transportation in her biplane, and a reporter who wants to get both sides of the controversy about Borglum’s huge project. She’s a tough woman, not too fazed by being kidnapped in a plot to stop the carving. The story starts slowly but picks up speed as a gang of bank robbers arrive after pulling a heist in Denver. There’s lots of excitement as the marshal and the bad guys meet in an abandoned mine.\n\nThe author based this story on his experiences working at two newspapers in the Black Hills area. He was director of public relations at St. Olaf College and Augsburg University before retiring to Colorado in 2013.\n\n“Call Me Speed”:by Dan Favreau (Independently published, $20.99)\n\nDan Favreau’s second novel set during the Vietnam war (after “Thumbs Up”) is not easy to read, but war isn’t easy. The author, a combat-wounded veteran who served with the 1st Air Cavalry, follows a group of young soldiers as they fight in Vietnam’s jungles and highlands, go on leave and always think about home.\n\nLiterary calendar for week of July 6\n\n8 graphic nonfiction books that use comics to unlock memoir, history and more\n\nLiterary calendar for week of June 29\n\nReaders and writers: Twin Cities baker\/writer in midst of marathon contemplation of MIA painting\n\n33 new books you’ll want to read this summer from independent publishers\n\nSpeed was a classroom troublemaker and outstanding athlete lauded for his running ability. Although his name is in the novel’s title, his friends are just as important to the plot, including one who stood up to high school bullies and another who escapes farming to become a crack sniper. Horrific scenes of killing enemy soldiers face to face and young bodies thrown out of foxholes by grenades are vividly drawn, as well as the terrible living conditions the men endure as they slog up hills in endless rain with no shelter except their ponchos. Even the conclusion is sad as we see the veterans in old age. This war seems far away now, but Favreau helps us remember the real-life men who suffered and watched their comrades die as soldiers always do in our seemingly endless wars.",

    "News_title":"The fading power of Xi Jinping",
    "News_text":"For dictators down the ages, nothing matters more than projecting an image of absolute and unchallenged power. The chance to stride the world stage at a glittering international summit is not to be missed.\n\nYetXi Jinping, the president of China, will spurn that opportunity on Sunday when he fails to arrive at a summit of Brics countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in Rio de Janeiro – the first time in his 12 years as paramount leader.\n\nThis announcement, along with other recent developments, has triggered speculation that Xi could be in political trouble or even thathis long supremacy over Chinamay be under threat.\n\nIna system built on secrecy, no one outside a tiny circle knows what is really happening behind the walls of Zhongnanhai, the closely guarded enclave near the Forbidden City in Beijing where Xi and his most senior colleagues have offices and state residences.\n\nWinston Churchill once likened power struggles in the Kremlin to “a bulldog fight under a rug”, adding: “An outsider only hears the growling and when he sees the bones fly out from beneath, it is obvious who won.”\n\nSo can we hear any growls from Zhongnanhai or see any bones hurled from beneath Chinese rugs? What conclusions aboutXi’s political standingmight we draw from recent events?\n\nAside from his non-attendance at Brics, we know the following for certain. Xi made no public appearances for 14 consecutive days between May 21 and June 5. A new Revolutionary Memorial Hall in Shaanxi province will not – contrary to expectations – be named after Xi Zhongxun, his late father, who also held high office in the Communist Party.\n\nHaving reigned for longer than any Chinese leader since Jiang Zemin, Xi turned 72 on June 15. And last month saw the purging of an admiral called Miao Hua from the Central Military Commission – the apex of China’s high command.\n\nJust as Cold War Kremlinologists would analyse the precise line-up of Politburo members at the May Day parade, so China-watchers are poring over these new facts.\n\nThus far, the most respected do not discern any clear sign that Xi is in trouble. “I see no evidence that he is losing power and I have not seen or heard any credible evidence of a move against him,” says Michael Sheridan, the author ofThe Red Emperor, a biography of Xi.\n\nBut just because no growls are audible outside Zhongnanhai, it does not follow that the bulldogs within must be quiescent. “Against all this,” says Sheridan candidly, “is the big caveat that we just don’t know.”\n\nChina’s leadership and people certainly have good reasons to question Xi’s judgment. Whether or not Covid-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology – and this explanation of its origins is at least as plausible as any other –his response to the pandemic was consistently disastrouswith tragic consequences for China and the world.\n\nThe doctors who first raised the alarm about a new virus in December 2019 were arrested, in line with the worst tradition of how authoritarian states respond to crises.\n\nWhen every hour counted, Xi said nothing in public about the gathering peril until Jan 20 2020, even though he had given an internal speech about the new virus 13 days earlier on Jan 7. Thanks to his vacillation and instinctive secrecy, the world lost a precious chance to nip the danger in the bud.\n\nOnce the pandemic was causing havoc,Xi’s draconian “zero Covid” policy brought China’s economy to its knees, causing such suffering that rare street protests forced him to reverse course. Suddenly, in December 2022, Chinese policy leapt from eradicating Covid to living with it.\n\nIn the meantime, Xi’s regime had neglected to inoculate millions of vulnerable elderly people and China’s vaccines were, in any case, less effective than those developed in the West.\n\nIn July 2022, only 51 per cent of Chinese over 80 had received one Covid vaccination, compared with 93 per cent in Japan.\n\nJust how many Chinese people died of Covid will never be known because Xi’s regime will not release the true figure, but the pandemic killed more than seven million worldwide.\n\nAs well as costing countless lives,Xi’s brutally inept responsebrought China’s economic juggernaut to a shuddering halt – and it has never fully restarted.\n\nDuring his first full year in power, 2013, China’s economy grew at 7.8 per cent, already the lowest figure since the turn of the century. Since then, he has presided over a steady slowdown.\n\nXi will be lucky if China hits the target growth rate of 5 per cent this year. Many economists suspect that the official numbers are heavily massaged, with the real figure being nearer to 3 per cent or less.\n\nThat is still well above the big Western economies, with the US recording 2 per cent growth in the first quarter. But for Xi, China’s economic performance is too weak for comfort.\n\nFive years ago he promised to double the size of the economy by 2035, both in absolute terms and per capita. Unless growth accelerates, he is on course to fail.\n\n“If they don’t get close to that, then I think it would be impossible for the Chinese leadership to stay so easily in control of everybody and everything,” says Lord O’Neill, the economist who coined the term “Bric” in 2001 to describe what were then the four biggest challengers to the Western order: Brazil, Russia, India and China.\n\nThe boom that allowedChina to become the world’s second largest economywas based on investment and exports. Today, economists agree that this model has run its course.\n\nExcess investment is leading to huge overcapacity, cut-throat competition and deflation. Meanwhile China’s exports are threatened by Donald Trump’s protectionism and the world’s unwillingness to buy all of its huge surplus production.\n\n“If you’re a small country, you can rely on exports for a long time to drive growth all the way up to high income levels, as we’ve seen happen elsewhere in Asia,” says Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China at Capital Economics.\n\n“But if you’re a very large economy like China then you start to dominate more and more of global trade. That engenders pushback at the global level, and it becomes harder and harder for the global economy to absorb more of your exports.”\n\nIf Xi is going to revive China’s economy, he will have to build a new growth model based on domestic consumption, meaning that everything will depend on persuading his people to spend more.\n\nBut a property crash has reduced the value of the most important asset of most Chinese families. The consumer confidence index slumped by a third after the property bubble burst in 2021, and has flatlined ever since. Youth unemployment is 15 per cent, five points higher than when Xi came to power.\n\n“I always used to think, in the first 25 years I followed China, that among their really good skills was knowing how to respond and when to respond,” says Lord O’Neill. “But there’s no two ways about it: since 2016-17, exacerbated by Covid and Trump, they’ve lost it a bit on that, for my liking. And I can’t fully rationalise how and why.”\n\nThe long overdue reckoning for China’s economy is now beginning. So far, Xi’s response has been to invest 300 billion RMB (£31 billion) in a scheme to allow households to trade in their old kitchen appliances for new models. This has succeeded in propping up retail sales, but overall confidence remains weak.\n\nGetting consumers to spend is the exact opposite of what the Communist Party has previously encouraged. “They spent a generation training people to work and sacrifice creature comforts,” says Kevin O’Marah, co-founder of a supply-chain research firm, Zero100. “And they’re trying to turn the wheel and get people to want ‘McMansions’ or want new appliances.”\n\nXi’s other intractable problem is that even if he succeeds in rebalancing the economy towards consumption, the outcome could be lower growth in the short term.\n\n“It smells like people [in the leadership] are petrified,” says Lord O’Neill. “And\/or they think that if they pull the plug on juicing up physical infrastructure, or giving yet more temporary support for parts of the property sector, then yes, it could boost consumption as a share of GDP, but it would mean GDP growth of 2.5 per cent as opposed to 5 per cent.”\n\nAlready, China’s economy has been growing at roughly the same pace as the world economy since 2020, meaning that China’s share of global GDP – the best measure of relative national power – is now flatlining. By this telling indicator, China is no longer a rising country.\n\nAnother vital trend will also weigh on future economic growth: China’s population is declining and ageing, allowing India to become the world’s most populous country.\n\nAll this means thatChina may never overtake America as the world’s biggest economy. For now, the US remains 50 per cent ahead at market exchange rates and China under Xi’s leadership is no longer closing the gap.\n\nNot every expert is pessimistic about Xi’s ability to solve the economy’s structural problems. “They do realise that consumption is vitally important for China now, and this is why we’re seeing a lot of the policies being shifted from supply-side policies to demand-side policies. But this is going to take time,” says Keyu Jin, of the London School of Economics.\n\n“If you look at the robotic industries, the EV [electric vehicle] industry, the new-energy investors, those things are doing quite well.”\n\nAs he grapples with all these problems, the leader is feeling the heat. “Xi Jinping is under a tonne of political pressure,” says O’Marah from Zero100. “There’s a lot of cultural dissatisfaction in China with the future that people’s children are going to inherit. He’s got to find a way to basically re-energise economic growth, give the people something to care about.”\n\nAlong the way,China’s neighbours have reacted against Xi’s belligerent diplomacyby doing exactly what he does not want and strengthening their ties with the United States. China’s “nine-dash line” on the nautical map, laying claim to almost all of the South China Sea, threatens every nation in a giant arc from the Philippines in the east to Indonesia in the south and Vietnam in the west.\n\nIn 2020, Chinese troops pressed so far forwards across their disputed Himalayan frontier with India that the two sides came to blows. Meanwhile, Xi’s relentless pressure on Taiwan has helped to make hawkishness on China one of the few points of bipartisan agreement in Washington.\n\nThe outcome is thatIndia has drawn closer to Americathrough the Quad, a newly important group which also includes Japan and Australia. In 2023 the Philippines allowed US forces to use another four bases in the country, including one in the northern province of Cagayan, close to Taiwan.\n\nBy his own incompetence, Xi has made it easier for America to strengthen its military position in East Asia, the very reverse of China’s objective.\n\nGiven Xi’s record of policy errors and misjudgments, any unexpected events are likely to cause speculation about his future. But it must be said that innocent explanations can be found for recent developments.\n\nVladimir Putin will also be skipping the Brics summit, largely because indicted war criminals like him struggle to travel without being arrested. Xi might have decided that it was hardly worth going all the way to Brazil if there was no chance of meeting his chief ally in the struggle against America and the West.\n\nEven worse, Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister and a key geopolitical rival, will be in Rio de Janeiro where he will attract perhaps too much attention. “Xi, as the Red Emperor, does not want to be overshadowed,” notes Michael Sheridan.\n\nAs for the supposed snub to the leader’s late father, the truth is that Xi Zhongxun already has a giant memorial in Shaanxi, which Sheridan describes as “grander than the tombs of the Ming Emperors”. Whether yet another monument will honour the name of the elder Xi may not matter very much.\n\nXi’s 14-day absence, meanwhile, has happened several times before. He may have health problems – he was certainly a heavy drinker in his youth – but his mother is still alive and she is nearly 100.\n\nTurning to Admiral Miao Hua, he is only the latest in a long line of victims of Xi’s ruthless campaign against official corruption: seven other members of the Central Military Commission have also been purged.\n\nKerry Brown, another British sinologist and former diplomat, points to vital warning lights that are not flashing. “Are there any central leaders saying slightly discordant things?” he asks. “Are there any provincial leaders who are sort of acting in a more autonomous way? Are there military leaders who are [making] overt statements, which are different from the government?”\n\nIt appears not.\n\nDr Dylan Loh, a China expert at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, says that another danger signal would be Xi disappearing from the state media. “One of the first few indications of him losing power would be very low – or significantly reduced – mentions of him and features of him in the main Chinese newspapers,” he says.\n\nOnce again, that light is not blinking. Xi featured on the front page of thePeople’s Daily, the regime’s main propaganda organ, 157 times between April and June, only marginally less than his 177 appearances during the same period last year, according to the China Media Project, a US-based research group.\n\nButthroughout Xi’s long rule, the metaphorical bulldogs really have chewed up a good many bones. In 2023 alone, two defence ministers, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, were purged while the foreign minister, Qin Gang, disappeared within months of his appointment.\n\nThe fate of this English-speaking career diplomat, once ambassador in Washington and first secretary at China’s embassy in London, remains unknown.\n\nWhile the two defence ministers were accused of corruption, Qin’s mistake was never disclosed. But Xi’s ruthless action against his subordinates briefly revealed the intense combat raging beneath the Chinese rug.\n\nYao Cheng, a former lieutenant-colonel in the People’s Liberation Army who defected to the US in 2016, says that Xi’sperformative campaign against elite corruptionhas stirred great resentment.\n\n“His arrests of the ‘corrupt’ are selective – he never truly targets the corrupt. It’s all about purging his rivals, which has upset many,” he says.\n\n“The PLA has wanted Xi to step down, but this is not what Xi wants. Once a national leader loses power in the military, they are vulnerable and Xi is now vulnerable.”\n\nThese are striking words, but Yao was never in the PLA’s senior ranks and he defected nearly 10 years ago. How much can he really know about the current situation in China?\n\nThe Communist Party Congress, where the country’s leadership and policy direction will be decided, is due in 2027. This occasion will be a key indicator of the future trajectory of China andthe strength of Xi’s grip on power.\n\nIt was during the 2018 Congress that the party removed a two-term limit on the appointment of the general secretary to allow Xi to prolong his supremacy indefinitely. Inconveniently, he owes his continued dominance to the fact that he engineered the rewriting of party rules to serve personal ambition.\n\n“Xi shouldn’t have been re-elected in the first place,” points out Yao. “The CCP’s rule was clear: you get to be elected as general secretary for two terms in a row, so Xi’s third term is not legal.”\n\nChina-watchers tend to agree that Xi’s usurpation of the rules and his ruthless purges have stirred resentment among the elite. “He’s transformed China in ways that make the common people very pleased but the elite Communist party members less happy,” says Drew Thompson, a former China director at the Pentagon. “There must be a high degree of animosity going into the next party Congress.”\n\nIf there is going to be an internal putsch, experts believe that Xi’s critics would strike during the Congress in 2027, although they would probably refrain from stripping him of all three of his official positions at once. Xi currently serves as president of the People’s Republic of China, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman of the Central Military Commission, allowing him to dominate the state, party and armed forces respectively.\n\nOne possibility is that Xi might keep his position at the apex of the military high command while a new figure becomes president – the least significant of the three roles – or even general secretary.\n\nFor now, all this is speculation and there is no indication of Xi advancing any particular bulldog as a favoured successor. So far, nothing suggests that he has come to grips with the eternal dilemma of all ageing autocrats as they contemplate their own mortality.\n\n“If you identify a successor too early, this successor may pre-emptively challenge your power or he may become a target for others to take down,” says Loh. “But if you leave it too late, the successor may not have a chance to build his base and get legitimacy.”\n\nLoh adds: “I would imagine that the next party Congress will be the time to give an indication of who the anointed one is, but until then it will be very fluid.”\n\nThe stakes for Xi could hardly be higher. If he fails to revive the economy, build a new growth model and confront the US with greater skill, the bulldogs may start growling – and it could be his bones that fly out from beneath the rug.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"White House suggests some countries could see tariff deadline shifted",
    "News_text":"Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Stephen Miran said that some countries that are negotiating with theUnited Statesin good faith could see tariffs delayed as President Donald Trump’s deadline to strike trade deals closes in.\n\nSpeaking with ABC News' \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos, Miran hedged on what deals are in the works.\n\n“On tariffs, the president's deadline is approaching for the deals. You've only seen three deals so far. What should we expect next?” Stephanopoulos asked.\n\nMORE: Trump administration live updates\n\n“I'm still optimistic that we're going to get a number of deals later this week. Part of that is because all the negotiating goes through a series of steps that lead to a culmination timed with the deadline,” Miran said.\n\nPressed on if these other deals fail to come through and if Trump would extend the deadline, Miran indicated that could be possible.\n\n“Well, my expectation would be that countries that are negotiating in good faith and making the concessions that they need to get to a deal, but the deal is just not there yet because it needs more time, my expectation will be that those countries get a roll, you know, sort of get the date rolled,” he said.\n\nAsked which countries could see that date shifted, Miran refused to elaborate, but said that he has heard good things about talks with Europe andIndia.\n\nMORE: Why some economists say the deficit increase in Trump’s bill is dangerous\n\n“I would expect that a number of countries that are in the process of making those concessions, you know, they might see their date rolled. For the countries that aren't making concessions, for the countries that aren't negotiating in good faith, I would expect them to sort of see higher tariffs,” Miran said. “But again, the president will decide later this week and in the time following whether or not the countries are doing what it takes to get access to the American market like they've grown accustomed to.”\n\nStephanopolous was also joined by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who balked at the potential economic benefits of Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“It probably will collect some revenue at the cost of higher inflation for American consumers, less competitiveness for American producers,\" Summers said. “So higher prices, less competitiveness, and not really that much revenue relative to what's being given to the very wealthy in this [budget] bill.”\n\nHere are more highlights from Miran and Summers' interviews:\n\nStephanopoulos:Why should we not believe the CBO when they say that something approaching a little more than 11 million people are going to be -- are going to lose their health care coverage because of the Medicaid cuts?\n\nMiran:Well, because they've been wrong in the past. When Republicans repealed the individual mandate penalty during the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the president's first term, CBO predicted that there was going to be about 5 million people losing their insurance by 2019. And you know what? The number was not very significantly changed at all. It was a tiny fraction of that. And so, they've been wrong in the past. And look, if we don't pass the -- if we didn't pass the bill, 8 to 9 million people would've lost their insurance for sure, as a result of the biggest tax act in history creating a huge recession. The best way to make sure people are insured is to grow the economy, get them jobs, get them working, get them insurance through their employer. Creating jobs, creating a booming economy is always the best way to get people insured.\n\nMORE: How soon will you feel the effects of Trump's megabill?\n\nStephanopoulos:You say this is all going to turbocharge growth. We have seen some experience with this back -- in Ronald Reagan's day, back in 1981. He had huge tax cuts. The growth didn't come, and they had to end up raising taxes for several years after that. Concerned that could happen again?\n\nMiran:Well, like I said before, you know, history's on our side. If you look at what happened in the president's first term, growth soared and there was no real material, you know, meaningful long-term decline in revenue. Revenue as a share of GDP was 17.1% last year, the same as it was before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So, you got this huge surge in growth as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. There was no material long-term decline in revenue. Corporate revenue even went up as a share of GDP from 1.6 to 1.9%. And the growth delivered. And we expect the same thing to happen this time.\n\nStephanopoulos:In The New York Times this week, you and Robert Rubin, who also served as president, as Treasury secretary, called this bill \"dangerous,\" said it “posed a huge risk to the economy.” What are those risks?\n\nSummers:George, just to start with, what your people have been describing is the biggest cut in the American safety net in history. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over 10 years, 100,000 people. That is 2,000 days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend. In my 70 years, I’ve never been as embarrassed for my country on July Fourth.These higher interest rates, these cutbacks in subsidies to electricity, these reductions in the availability of housing, the fact that hospitals are going to have to take care of these people and pass on the costs to everybody else, and that's going to mean more inflation, more risk that the Fed has to raise interest rates and run the risk of recession, more stagflation, that's the risk facing every middle-class family in our country because of this bill. And for what? A million dollars over 10 years to the top tenth of a percent of our population. Is that the highest priority use of federal money right now? I don't think so. This is a shameful act by our Congress and by our president that is going to set our country back.\n\nStephanopoulos:Part of the president's argument is that economic growth sparked by the bill will alleviate the dangers that you talk about here. The chair of the Council of Economic Advisers is up next and his council issued a report this week projecting $11 trillion in deficit reduction from growth, higher tax revenue and savings on debt payments. How do you respond to that?\n\nSummers:It is, respectfully, nonsense. None of us can forecast what's going to happen to economic growth. What we can forecast is that when people have to hold government debt instead of being able to invest it in new capital goods, new machinery, new buildings, that makes the economy less productive. What we can forecast is that when we're investing less in research and development, investing less in our schools, that there is a negative impact on economic growth. There is no economist anywhere, without a strong political agenda, who is saying that this bill is a positive for the economy. And the overwhelming view is that it is probably going to make the economy worse. Think about it this way. How long can the world's greatest debtor remain the world's greatest power? And this is piling more debt onto the economy than any piece of tax legislation in dollar terms that we have ever had.",

    "News_title":"Russia and Ukraine trade drone strikes as Kyiv signs deals to boost drone production",
    "News_text":"Russia and Ukraine struck each other with hundreds of drones on Sunday, throwing Russian air travel in disarray, shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced deals with Western partners that would allow Kyiv to scale up drone production.\n\nPhotos circulating on social media showed crowds huddling at Russian airports including key international hubs in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as hundreds of flights were delayed or canceled due to Ukrainian drone strikes on Saturday and overnight, according to Russia’s Transport Ministry.\n\nThe flight disruptions hit Moscow’s Sheremetyevo and St. Petersburg’s main Pulkovo airports. Other airports in western and central Russia also faced disruptions.\n\nRussian air defenses shot down 120 Ukrainian drones during the nighttime attacks, and 39 more before 2 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. It did not clarify how many had hit targets, or how many had been launched in total.\n\nEarly on Sunday, Ukrainian drones injured two civilians in Russia’s Belgorod region near the border, its Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.\n\nRussia pounded Kyiv last week\n\nThe Ukrainian attacks came just days after Russia pummelled Kyiv with waves of drones and missiles overnight into Friday, in what Ukrainian officials called the largest such strike since Moscow’s all-out invasion. The seven-hour onslaught killed at least two civilians, wounded dozens more and caused widespread damage, Ukraine said, while Moscowramped up its pushto capture more of its neighbor’s land.\n\nIn total, Russia launched 550 drones and missiles across Ukraine that night, according to the country’s air force. The barrages have coincided with a concerted Russian effort to break through parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where Ukrainian troops are under severe pressure.\n\nLarge-scale Russian drone strikes on Sunday injured three civilians in Kyiv and at least two in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city in the northeast, officials said. A Russian attack involving Shahed drones also targeted port infrastructure in Mykolaiv in central Ukraine, according to local Gov. Vitaliy Kim. He reported warehouses and the port’s power grid were damaged but there were no casualties.\n\nHours later, Russia launched a glide bomb and a drone at the front-line town of Kostyantynivka in eastern Ukraine, killing four civilians and injuring a fifth, the prosecutor’s office said. The drone struck a car in which a married couple were travelling, killing the 39-year-old woman and 40-year-old man on the spot, it said.\n\nUkraine seeks to ramp up drone production\n\nZelenskyy said on Saturday that Ukraine had inked deals with European allies and a leading U.S. defense company to step up drone production, ensuring Kyiv receives “hundreds of thousands” more this year.\n\nZelenskyy did not name the U.S. business in his nightly video address to Ukrainians, but said Ukraine and Denmark have also agreed to co-produce drones and other weapons on Danish soil.\n\nHis remarks came days after the U.S.paused some shipments of military aidto Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles. Ukraine’s main European backersare considering howthey can help pick up the slack. Zelenskyy said plans are afoot to build up Ukraine’s domestic arms industry, butscaling up will take time.\n\nUkraine has previously used homemade drones to hit high-value military targets deep inside Russia, demonstrating its capabilities and denting Moscow’s confidence. Last month,Kyiv said it destroyed more than 40 Russian planesstationed at several airfields deep inside Russia in a surprise attack.\n\nOutmanned and outgunned, Ukraine’s army has also turned to drones to compensate for its troop shortage and shore up its defenses. While Russia hasramped up offensivesthis summer on two fronts in Ukraine, analysts say the front isn’t about to collapse.\n\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy said he had a “very important and productive” phone call that day with U.S.President Donald Trump, discussing possible joint drone production alongsideU.S-led efforts to end the war.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump described the call as “good”.\n\n“He’s been hit very hard, as I said he would. He’s been hit very hard,” he said.\n\n___\n\nMichelle L.

    "News_title":"Not even Trump can stand in Netanyahu’s way",
    "News_text":"Payback will be the sentiment uppermost in Donald Trump’s mind when he hosts the Israeli premier in Washington this week. In return for providing vital military support for Israel’s military assault on Iran’s nuclear programme, Trump will expect Benjamin Netanyahu’s unequivocal support forhis Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\nThe Israeli military may have carried out ahighly impressive operationto destroy and degrade Iran’s key nuclear facilities, as well as liquidating several top nuclear scientists and commanders in the regime’s intelligence and security establishment, but not even the Israelis could summon the firepower to take out two of Iran’s key nuclear targets, the underground enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow. Trump’s decision, therefore, to authorise US air strikes against the heavily-fortified compounds, using fourteen 30,000lb Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPS) to destroy the facilities, provided a vital boost to the Israeli offensive.\n\nAnd even though the jury is still out about how much damage the Americans inflicted on Iran’s nuclear programme – there are already suggestions that Iran has resumed work on enriching uranium – Trump clearly believes his military contribution helped the Israelis to achieve their military objectives in Operation Rising Lion, their codename for the Iran attack.\n\nNow, having forced Tehran and Jerusalem to observe a ceasefire, Trump hasturned his attention to Gaza. This is a president who, after all, has set his sights on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Ending the war in Gaza – together with resolving the conflict in Ukraine – have been two of Trump’s main foreign policy objectives since returning to the White House.\n\nWhile his efforts in Ukraine have been frustrated byPutin’s marked lack of interest in a ceasefire, the White House has enjoyed a modicum of success in Gaza, where it did succeed in establishing a short-lived break in the fighting earlier this year. The most notable elements of that deal were the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and the easing of restrictions on humanitarian aid for Gaza’s battered civilian population.\n\nThe ceasefire collapsed at the end of March amid mutual recriminations, with Israel resuming its military offensive against Hamas terrorists.\n\nBuoyed by his successful intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict, Trump believes now is the time to strike a new ceasefire deal, which would be based on similar terms to the previous agreement implemented earlier this year. In return for the staggered release of Israeli hostages – both dead and alive – hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be freed from Israeli jails, aid supplies will resume and Israel will be expected to begin a phased withdrawal from territory it has occupied in the enclave.\n\nWhile Netanyahu can be expected to accept the hostages-for-prisoners formula, and ease aid restrictions, he will be more resistant to the notion of any military withdrawal from Gaza so long as any vestige remains intact.\n\nThus, while Trump has sought to pre-empt the outcome of his meeting with Netanyahu by announcing that Israel has already agreed to the “necessary conditions” to finalise a 60-day ceasefire, there will nonetheless be concerns at the White House that the Israeli premier will not be prepared to commit to any form of military withdrawal until Hamas’s presence in Gaza has been fully eradicated. This was Israel’s key military objective in the wake of the October 7 attacks in 2023, and remains so to this day.\n\nWhile the US and Israel have forged an effective alliance in combatting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, on a personal level tensions remain between Trump and Netanyahu, who have not always enjoyed the easiest of relationships. Trump has privately accused Netanyahu of being ungrateful for the backing he receives from Washington, especially after the key role Trump played during his first term negotiating the Abraham Accords, which saw several Arab states normalise relations with Israel.\n\nThese tensions memorably erupted in public after Trump accused both Israel and Iran of breaching the ceasefire terms he arranged at the end of the Iran conflict in June, claiming that they“don’t know what the f*** they are doing”. Using expletives to describe Iran’s conduct is nothing new for Trump – he used the F-word about Iran in 2020. But using it in relation to a country that is supposed to be one of Washington’s closest allies showed that not even Netanyahu is immune from Trump’s temper tantrums.\n\nThe risk of upsetting Trump, and provoking one of his famous Oval Office outbursts, will therefore be one of Netanyahu’s foremost concerns during his Washington visit, as will be his desire to ensure that he ultimately achieves his goal of destroying Hamas in Gaza.\n\nOne important consequence of the US-Israel military attack on Iran is that Tehran is no longer in a position to maintain its support for Hamas’s terrorist activities, placing the terrorist organisation in its weakest position since the October 7 attacks.\n\nWith Hamas on the ropes, Netanyahu will remain committed to achieving his ultimate goal of destroying the organisation once and for all, even if it means upsetting his White House host.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Let's estimate that the next rate will be $1.78 per share, +4% YoY.\n\nThat means the NTM DPS rate will be $6.98 per share, and so today's NTM yield is actually over 4.7%:\n\n$6.98 \/ $148.37 = 0.04704 =4.704% (NTM Yield)\n\nThat is well over its 5-year average yield:\n\nYahoo! Finance.……4.36%\n\nSeeking Alpha …….4.21%\n\nMorningstar ……….4.17%\n\nAverage 5-yr Yield4.25%\n\nAs a result, we can project CVX stock's value should it revert to its historical mean, using the NTM dividend per share (DPS):\n\n$6.98 NTM DPS \/ 0.0425 =$164.24target price\n\nThat is almost 11% higher than the July 3 closing price:\n\n$164.24\/$148.37 = 1.1069 -1 =+10.7%upside\n\nThis also coincides with analysts' target prices.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance (25) have an average price target of$163.23per share, or +10% higher than today.  Similarly, Barchart's mean price target is$161.73, and StockAnalysis.com says the average from 15 analysts is$164.79(close to my price target).\n\nHowever, AnaChart.com, which covers recent analyst write-ups, shows that 21 analysts have an average of$181.20per share. That is +22% higher than today.\n\nThe bottom line is that the median of these surveys is$164.01, very close to my dividend-yield-based target of$164.24.\n\nAs a result, there seems to be +10-11% potential upside in CVX stock, and potentially up to 22% more.\n\nBut there is no guarantee this will occur over the next 12 months. Therefore, one way to play this is to set a lower potential buy-in price.\n\nInvestors can do this by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in a near-term expiry period (usually one month is ideal). The upside here is that investors can make a good one-month yield with this play.\n\nMy last article on June 16 pointed out that the $140 strike price put option expiring July 18 had a midpoint premium of $2.07, a one-month yield of1.48%($2.07\/$140.00). This strike price was 3.3% below the trading price (i.e., out-of-the-money or OTM).\n\nToday, the price is just 39 cents, so the short-put investor has made most of the yield. They can roll this over (i.e., “Buy to Open”) and do a new trade further out.\n\nFor example, look at the August 8 expiration period, which is just over one month away. The $144.00 put option, 3% below the trading price, has a midpoint premium of $2.41.\n\nThat gives the short put investor a one-month yield of1.67%(i.e., $2.41\/$144.00).\n\nNote that this trade has a low probability of being assigned, less than one-third chance, since the delta ratio is -32.7%.\n\nIn addition, the annualized potential return is attractive at16.7%(i.e., 365\/36 days to expiry). Moreover, even after rolling the prior trade over, $2.41-$0.39 = $2.02\/$144.00 = 0.014 =1.40%. In other words, the investor can make the same yield as before.\n\nThe beauty of this type of trade is that the investor does not have to wait for the full expiration period to make good money. For example, the net income since June 16 is:\n\n$2.07 - $0.39 +$2.41 = $4.09 or $409 per put contract (with 100 shares per put contract)\n\nBut the average investment would have been $14,200 (i.e., $140 strike price in the first trade and $144 in the second). Therefore, the net yield has been 2.88%:\n\n$409\/$14,200 = 0.0288 =2.88%\n\nThis is over 53 days between June 16 and August 8 (and potentially shorter if the investor covers before then). Let's assume that most of the yield is made over the next 21 days. The investment period would be 40 days. So the annualized expected return (ER) is as follows:\n\n365\/40 = 11 periods x 2.88% =31.68%\n\nThat is a very high expected return, assuming that the investor can repeat this play every 40 days. The point is that these out-of-the-money puts are a very attractive way to play CVX stock.\n\nMoreover, the investor's breakeven point, should CVX stock fall 3% to the $144.00 strike price, makes this a good investment:\n\n$144.00-$2.41 = $141.59\n\n$164.24 \/ $141.59 = 1.16 -1 =+16%\n\nThe bottom line is that by shorting puts expiring in one month, the short-put CVX investor can make a potential+16%upside. Even if CVX doesn't fall, the short-put yield is1.67%for slightly over one month.\n\nThat works out to 16.7% annualized, and potentially up to almost 32% if these trades are duplicated every 40 days.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Maura Healey approved a $60.9 billion annual budget and rolled out a companion proposal designed to empower her administration with greater cost-cutting power.\n\nHealey on Friday signed the fiscal year 2026 budget lawmakerssent her on Monday, in the process vetoing $130 million in planned spending amid crystallizing concerns that federal funding to Massachusetts will drop and the state may face new costs in a world where the so-called “big, beautiful bill” is the law of the land.\n\nBetween her spending cuts and changes that legislative negotiators made to cushion against financial strain, the final budget that became law — which is packed with big funding boosts for health care, education and transportation plus policy measures likea limit on renter-paid broker fees— raises spending by more than 5% but is more than $1 billion smaller than the version Healey filed in January, before the federal bill emerged.\n\nThe governor and her deputies will pursue other steps to further buttress against budgetary impacts from economic downturn or federal funding cuts, especially to the massive and costly Medicaid insurance program.\n\nOfficials announced Friday thatan executive branch hiring freezeimplemented in May will remain in effect for the duration of fiscal year 2026, which runs through next June. The administration will also scrap a 2% raise for thousands of executive branch managers set to start in January, which officials said would save $17 million.\n\nWhile Healey did not veto any of the earmarks lawmakers wrote into the budget to support projects and programs in their districts, the administration will delay paying about $125 million of those until at least the fall. Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said if the state is in a precarious fiscal position at that point, everything will be on the table, including cancellation of earmarks.\n\nSome of the governor’s biggest new plans to control state spending will need buy-in from the Legislature.\n\nHealey on Friday filed a new $130 million supplemental budget bill that her office said would create a $100 million “flexible pool of resources” that the administration could tap later in the year to deal with “changing economic conditions and federal spending decisions.” The other $30 million would go toward a housing preservation and stabilization fund, which Gorzkowicz said would provide resources to housing programs amid concerns about safety-net impacts from new federal policy.\n\nThat bill would also grant the administration the ability to transfer some line-item spending between agencies and use capital dollars instead of operating dollars to pay for some Department of Transportation workers. The governor is also asking for new authority that might prove unpalatable to some lawmakers: a limited-time ability to cut spending unilaterally from the entire state budget.\n\nThe existing state law limits a governor’s power to trim spending midway through the year only to the executive branch, which according to Gorzkowicz makes up roughly 55% to 60% of the budget. Other areas like quasi-public agencies, local aid, retirement and other post-employment benefits, and debt service cannot be targeted by what are commonly known as “9C cuts.”\n\nGorzkowicz said the new supplemental budget would, only in fiscal year 2026, allow the administration to trim from anywhere if revenue collections fall at least $400 million below projected benchmarks or if federal policy changes cost the state budget $400 million or more.\n\nOfficials are still sifting through the federal megabill, which the U.S. House approved Thursday and Trump plans to sign Friday, to determine its full impacts on state budgeting. Gorzkowicz said he hopes to have a better understanding in roughly a month.\n\nApreliminary estimatefrom health policy nonprofit KFF suggested the Medicaid changes could cost Massachusetts $15 billion to $25 billion over the next decade.\n\nAnother outside section to Healey’s new bill would grant the state Department of Public Health the ability to set the schedule for childhood vaccines instead of relying on recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — a panel that U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedycompletely reshaped last month.\n\nThe timing of Healey’s budget signature is unusual in two ways: she announced the action on a federal holiday that created a long weekend, and she acted more quickly on an annual budget than any Massachusetts governor in at least 25 years.\n\nFor every other annual budget since fiscal 2001, at least seven days elapsed between the final Senate enactment vote and the governor’s response, according to data tracked by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.\n\nGorzkowicz said the administration wanted to move rapidly on the budget because lawmakers sent it to Healey before the July 1 start of the fiscal year for the first time since 2016.\n\nIn another unusual move, Healey does not plan any press conference to discuss her budget actions. The only public event on her schedule Friday is attending the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Charles River Esplanade in the evening.\n\n“I’m proud to sign a budget that is fiscally responsible and protects what makes Massachusetts special,” Healey said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Legislature for their strong partnership and efficient work to develop and pass this budget for the people we serve. In Massachusetts, we are continuing to lead and do what we know works – focusing on lowering costs, protecting essential care and services, and moving our economy forward by investing in housing, transportation and our schools.”\n\n“We are also signing this budget in a moment of great dysfunction in Washington,” she added. “The President is poised to sign a bill that’s going to kick hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents off their health care, increase energy and groceries prices, and cost people their jobs.”\n\nIn a social mediapostthe day before she announced her action on the budget, Healey touted her approach to state spending as a contrast with the incoming federal law.\n\n“We want you to have access to health care, to education, transportation,” Healey said. “I want you to be able to afford groceries, housing, heat and electricity. That’s what we’re focused on delivering.”\n\nThe fiscal 2026 budget increases state spending just shy of 5.4% over the spending bill Healey signed last summer. Some of that increase is driven by the use of $2.4 billion in revenue from the voter-approved surtax on high earners, which will fund major investments in K-12 schools, early education and care grants, operating support for the MBTA and regional transit authorities.\n\nHealey vetoed a combined $130 million from 28 line items, less than the $248 million net spending she struck from last year’s budget and the $205 million net spending she eliminated the year before.\n\nA $27.5 million reduction this time around pairs with a directive Healey issued to the Group Insurance Commission to eliminate coverage of GLP-1 weight loss drugs for state employees unless medically necessary. Officials said that change would more closely match private health insurance, where several plans have called out the increasingly popular drugs as major cost drivers.\n\nHealey also cut $10 million from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, according to Sen. Michael Barrett, the Senate’s point person for energy and climate policy and the chairman whose committee is reviewing Healey’s energy affordability legislation.\n\nThe governor originally proposed a $30 million outlay for MassCEC. The conference committee budget settled on $20 million, and then Healey vetoed it down to $10 million.\n\nBarrett said the additional change hinders clean tech at a time when it is talked about as a cornerstone of the state’s economy for decades to come and threatens the state’s readiness for a post-Trump era.\n\n“I don’t quite see how it all computes and I’m astounded. I feel that Massachusetts is sending a very weird signal out into the world,” Barrett said. “We’re not going to see any clean energy progress on the federal front and now we’re doing something that would have the effect of doubling the federal assault.”\n\nAn official said Friday afternoon that the administration will use $10 million from an Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs trust fund to bring MassCEC funding to a combined $20 million after the veto.\n\nLawmakers have the power to override any of the governor’s vetoes with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.\n\nHealey also returned two outside sections of the budget with amendments, one seeking a technical change and the other proposed to study, not implement, a mandatory retirement savings program for employees who lack access to such programs through their workplaces.\n\nThat Secure Choice Savings Program haddrawn criticismfrom the National Federation of Independent Business both when the House quietly added it via amendment and when the provision survived conference committee negotiations.\n\nIn a letter to lawmakers alongside her amendment, Healey said she believes “further consideration of the proposal is warranted.”\n\n“Saving for retirement is an important goal, but there are many ways to encourage this behavior. This proposal has invited feedback from various groups who, while supportive of the goal of expanding access to retirement saving, suggest there are additional implementation questions that need to be resolved prior to enactment,” Healey wrote. “These implementation questions should be answered before we establish a new statewide program and obligation on Massachusetts employers.”\n\nLegislative negotiators built some flexibility into the final state budget bill they shipped Healey, aiming to strike a balance between Democrats’ appetite for significant spending on state services and the prospect of federal funding cuts.\n\nThey trimmed the bottom line hundreds of millions of dollars below the original House- and Senate-approved versions, incorporatednearly half a billion extra surtax dollars, and left about $800 million in anticipated revenuesunappropriated as a cushionagainst future impacts.\n\nHouse budget chief Aaron Michlewitz called the legislative budget “not only [a bill] that will allow our economy to grow, but will also do this while maintaining the Legislature’s commitment to fiscal stability [and] sustainability.”\n\n“Some have said that this piece of legislation is actually the real ‘big, beautiful bill’ being taken up this week,” Michlewitz said Monday while introducing the accord. “Unlike the one in Washington, this piece of legislation is one that will not hurt our residents, but will help improve the lives of all our constituents, not just the ones with the largest paychecks.”\n\nGorzkowicz said the administration has spoken with budget chiefs in the House and Senate about convening a hearing in the fall with economists to examine the state’s financial footing and whether officials need to revise their tax collection estimates for fiscal 2026.\n\nThe secretary by law must certify by Oct. 15 that the state has sufficient revenues to fulfill expenditures, and he said that deadline will be a key early milestone.\n\nHealey’s office provided written quotes about the budget from House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka thanking the governor for her signature.\n\n“This FY26 budget makes key investments that better support Massachusetts students and families, that increase access to affordable health care, and that provide for a safer and more reliable public transportation system – all without raising taxes,” Mariano said. “In a moment of incredible uncertainty at the federal level, this budget is proof that government can be both fiscally responsible and an agent of good, the kind of government that our residents deserve.”\n\nAdded Spilka, “In Massachusetts, we know that the best investment we can make is in our people, and this budget reflects the Senate’s continuing commitment to do so while maintaining our equal commitment to responsible money management. This statewide approach to investment delivers resources to every part of the state and protects our most vulnerable residents from the cruelest actions of the federal government, while our continued focus on education and mental health ensures that people have they keys to unlock the doors of opportunity.”\n\nWWLP-22News, an NBC affiliate, began broadcasting in March 1953 to provide local news, network, syndicated, and local programming to western Massachusetts.

    "News_text":"By Yomna Ehab\n\nADEN\/CAIRO (Reuters) -Israel struck Houthi targets at three Yemeni ports and a power plant, the military said early on Monday, in its first attack on Yemen in nearly a month.\n\nThe strikes hit the ports of Hodeidah, Ras Isa and Salif, as well as the Ras Qantib power plant on the coast, in response to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel, the military said.\n\nHours later, Israel said two missiles were launched from Yemen. Attempts were made to intercept them, though the results were still under review. The Iran-aligned Houthi forces said they had fired missiles and drones at multiple targets in Israel in retaliation for the strikes on Yemen.\n\nThe Israeli ambulance service said it had not received any calls regarding missile impacts or casualties following the launches from Yemen.\n\nSince the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, the Houthis have fired at Israel and at shipping in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade, in what the group says are acts of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nMost of the dozens of missiles and drones fired toward Israel have been intercepted or fallen short. Israel has carried out a series of retaliatory strikes.\n\nIsrael said its attacks on Monday also targeted a ship, the Galaxy Leader, which was seized by the Houthis in late 2023 and held in Ras Isa port.\n\n\"The Houthi terrorist regime's forces installed a radar system on the ship, and are using it to track vessels in international maritime space in order to promote the Houthi terrorist regime’s activities,\" the military said.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesperson said the group's air defences had responded to the Israeli attack with \"a large number of domestically produced surface-to-air missiles\".\n\nIsrael's military told residents to evacuate the three ports before it launched its attacks. Residents of Hodeidah told Reuters that the strikes on the power station had knocked out electricity. There was no immediate information on casualties.\n\nThe Israeli assault comes hours after a ship was attacked off of Hodeidah and the ship's crew abandoned it as it took on water. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but security firm Ambrey said the vessel fit the typical profile of a Houthi target.\n\nThe Houthis, who control northern Yemen including the capital Sanaa, are one of the last pro-Iran armed groups still standing in the Middle East after Israel severely hurt other allies of Tehran: Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Iran itself in a 12-day air war last month.\n\nUnder the direction of leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.\n\n(Reporting by Mohammed Ghobari, Yomna Ehab, Menna Alaa El Din and Jana ChoukeirWriting by Yomna EhabEditing by Lisa Shumaker, Diane Craft, Lincoln Feast, Peter Graff)",

    "News_text":"Socialist mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani appears to defend al Qaeda fiendAnwar al-Awlaki— and blame America for turning the prostitution-loving cleric into a terrorist — in newlysurfaced tweets.\n\nAl-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, became a prominent imam at mosques in San Diego and Virginia, eventually interacting with three of the heinous Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers there, US officials have said.\n\nHe was put under surveillance by the FBI after 9\/11 — a probe that uncovered among other things the fact that the conservative family-values-preaching Muslim cleric was frequenting prostitutes at hotels.\n\nAl-Awlaki moved to Yemen in 2004 — where he joined al Qaeda and hatched numerous international terrorist plots while preaching jihad in videos and on CDs.\n\nThe cleric was considered so dangerous that then-President Barack Obama approvedthe drone strike that killed him in 2011— an unprecedented assassination of an American citizen who had not been charged with a crime.\n\n“He directed the failed attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009. He directed the failed attempt to blow up US cargo planes in 2010,” Obama said at the time.\n\n“And he repeatedly called on individuals in the United States and around the globe to kill innocent men, women and children to advance a murderous agenda.”\n\nBut Mamdani, in a series of tweets in 2015, bizarrely criticized the FBI’s surveillance of al-Awlaki — and claimed the G-Men actually pushed him into terrorism — after reading aNew York Times accountof the snooping, whichrevealed the cleric’s hooker fetish.\n\n“Why no proper interrogation of what it means for FBI to have conducted extensive surv. into Awlaki’s private life?” wrote Mamdani, then 23.\n\n“How could #Awlaki have ever trusted@FBI to not release surveillance esp. if he continued to critique [the] state? Why no further discussion of how #Awlaki’s knowledge of surv. eventually led him to #alqaeda? Or what that says about [the] efficacy of surv?” Mamdani said.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.Subscribe here!\n\nThe comments have enraged 9\/11 victims’ families and US anti-terror officials.\n\n“To blame the United States for al-Awlaki is like blaming the Jews for Hitler,” seethed retired Long Island Rep. Peter King, who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee and served on the Intelligence Committee that received confidential briefings on al-Awlaki.\n\nRetired FDNY Lt. Jim McCaffrey — whose brother-in-law,FDNY Battalion 7Chief Orio Palmer, rushed into the World Trade Center’s south tower to try to help people before the building collapsed on him and hundreds of others during the hijacked-plane strike — called Mamdani’s comments “very offensive to 9\/11 victims and their families.\n\n“It’s offensive to all New Yorkers and all Americans,” he said.\n\n“It’s an absolutely ridiculous assertion on Mamdani’s part. The FBI agents were doing their job,” said McCaffrey, who himself spent many days participating in search and recovery efforts at Ground Zero. “This guy al-Awlaki had connections to al Qaeda. But [Mamdani’s] blaming the FBI?”\n\nMcCaffrey said it was “eye-opening” and “frightening” that Mamandi, a 33-year-old Queens state assemblyman, is now the favorite to be elected the next mayor of New York City.\n\nTom Von Essen, the city fire commissioner during 9\/11, said, “Just what NYC needs — another mayor who blames the government for creating criminals.\n\n“We tried this with Bill de Blasio. It can not end well,” he said, referring to the lefty former mayor roundly criticized for his disastrous soft-on-crime policies.\n\nKing added, “Mamdani is making excuses and rationalizing al-Awlaki joining al Qaeda.\n\n“He’s trying to blame the US for him becoming a terrorist. It’s an absolute disgrace. It should disqualify Mamdani from being mayor of New York City.\n\n“Al-Awlaki was an evil man. It was a great victory to eliminate him from the face of the Earth,” King said.\n\nIntelligence sources claimed al-Awlaki’s disciples had been linked to about a quarter of the Islamists convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States from 2007 until his death.\n\nMamdani’s other slick, savvy and cheeky videos on social media helpedpower his victory over ex-Gov.

    "News_title":"Ship attacked in the Red Sea after a bulk carrier sinking claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels",
    "News_text":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A Liberian-flagged cargo ship came under fire from Houthi rebels Monday in the Red Sea, with two on board reported to be hurt and two others missing in an assault a day after the Yemen-based rebels sunk another vessel.\n\nThe attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Eternity C in the crucial maritime route came after the Houthis attacked the Liberian-flagged, Greek-ownedbulk carrier Magic Seaswith drones, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire Sunday, forcing its crew of 22 to abandon the vessel.\n\nThe two attacks and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday targeting the rebels raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S. and Western forces, particularly after U.S. PresidentDonald Trump's administrationtargeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.\n\nThe attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program followingAmerican airstrikes targeting its most sensitive atomic sitesduring the Israel-Iran war in June.\n\nShip attacks strike Red Sea\n\nThe European Union anti-piracy patrol Operation Atalanta and the private security firm Ambrey reported the latest attack. They said the Eternity C had been heading north toward the Suez Canal when it came under fire by men in small boats and by bomb-carrying drones. The security guards on board also fired their weapons.\n\nOperation Atalanta said the Eternity C had a crew of 21 Filipinos and one Russian, plus three security personnel. The EU force said the ship had not requested an escort.\n\nThe EU force also said the Houthis carried out the attack.\n\nMoammar al-Eryani, the information minister with Yemen's internationally recognized government that opposes the Houthis and is based in southern Yemen, also blamed the rebels for the Eternity C attack. The Houthis control the northern half of Yemen and its capital, Sanaa.\n\nThe attack on the Eternity C happened in the same area as the attack Sunday on the Magic Seas, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of the port of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the Houthis.\n\nAn armed security team on the vessel had returned fire against an initial attack of gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, though the vessel later was struck by projectiles. Operation Atalanta, said 22 mariners had been on board the Magic Seas, with the United Arab Emirates saying an Abu Dhabi Ports vessel rescued the sailors.\n\nBrig. Gen. Yahya Saree, the Houthis' military spokesman, claimed Sunday's attack on the Magic Seas. Saree later said the vessel sunk.\n\nThe Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel noted the later attack Monday, but the rebels didn’t claim that assault. They routinely wait hours or even days after an attack to do so.\n\nIsraeli strikes target Houthi-held ports\n\nThe Israeli military said that it struck Houthi-held ports early Monday at Hodeida, Ras Isa and Salif, as well as the Ras Kanatib power plant. It released footage showing an F-16 launching from Israel for the strike, which came after the Israeli military issued a warning for the area.\n\n“These ports are used by the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons from the Iranian regime, which are employed to carry out terrorist operations against the state of Israel and its allies,” the Israeli military said.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it struck the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle-carrying vessel that the Houthis seized back in November 2023 when they began their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n“Houthi forces installed a radar system on the ship and have been using it to track vessels in the international maritime arena to facilitate further terrorist activities,” the Israeli military said.\n\nThe Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader was affiliated with an Israeli billionaire and had been operated by a Japanese firm, NYK Line.\n\nThe Houthis acknowledged the strikes, but gave no damage assessment.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly attacked Houthi areas in Yemen,including a naval strike in June. Both Israel and the United States have struck ports in the area in the past — includingan American attackthat killed 74 people in April — but Israel is now acting alone in attacking the rebels as they continue to fire missiles at Israel.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened to launch further strikes.\n\n“What’s true for Iran is true for Yemen,” Katz said in a statement. “Anyone who raises a hand against Israel will have it cut off. The Houthis will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions.”\n\nHouthi attacks came over the Israel-Hamas war\n\nThe Houthi rebels have been launchingmissile and drone attacksagainst commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as aneffort to endIsrael’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBetween November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them andkilling four sailors. Their campaign has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.\n\nThe Houthis paused attacks until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven’t attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasionalmissile attacks targeting Israel.",
