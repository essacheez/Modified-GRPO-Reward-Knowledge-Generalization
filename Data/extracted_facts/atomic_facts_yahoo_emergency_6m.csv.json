    "News_text":"A forest fire at a former military training ground in the eastern German state of Saxony has significantly expanded, in what has now been deemed a major hazard situation, authorities said on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 200 firefighters are battling the flames, which have now reached the neighbouring state of Brandenburg, which surrounds the capital Berlin, they said.\n\n\"Together with the Saxony state police, the use of firefighting helicopters is currently being examined, taking into account the presence of unexploded ordnance in the fire area,\" the district office stated late on Wednesday evening.\n\nWednesday marked the third consecutive day of firefighting operations in Saxony that have forced dozens of residents from their homes.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, a village that is home to a residency for people with severe disabilities was evacuated, according to Raiko Riedel from the Zeithain fire brigade.\n\nA few hours later, residents at a neighbouring town received notification via a warning app saying they needed to evacuate. Shortly before midnight, an all-clear was given for this area.\n\nFire area increases tenfold\n\nThe fire's spread has increased more than tenfold since midday, said Riedel, who is the deputy municipal fire chief in Zeithain. At least 600 hectares are now affected by the blaze. Late in the evening, the Meißen district authorities reported that more than 200 emergency personnel were active at various fire sites.\n\n\"The fire is moving northwards, towards Brandenburg,\" Riedel said in the evening. The dry vegetation is facilitating the rapid spread, along with light winds. Authorities are eyeing a biogas plant in the area that needs to be protected from the blaze.\n\nTwo firefighters injured in nearby Brandenburg\n\nEarlier, Brandenburg's Interior Minister René Wilke announced that the fire had crossed the state line into Brandenburg. A female firefighter and a male firefighter suffered burns during the operation and were seriously injured. Sixty-five emergency personnel from Brandenburg are involved in the effort.\n\n\"The fire has escalated,\" said Brandenburg's forest fire protection officer, Raimund Engel, adding that an entire open area known as the heathland is burning. Emergency personnel from Brandenburg are stationed at the state border, ready to assist.\n\nThe fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon near a demolition site used by the ordnance disposal service, according to a fire brigade spokesperson. By Wednesday night, the fire had initially been contained. The terrain is challenging due to the risk of unexploded ordnance detonating on the former military training ground.\n\nThe Gohrischheide area has been a nature reserve for several decades and is home to endangered breeding birds in Saxony. The area has experienced multiple fires in the past.\n\nIn June 2022, a fire there became the largest forest fire in Saxony in 30 years, causing millions of euros in damage. A year later, another fire broke out, with firefighting efforts also lasting several days. In both cases, arson was suspected as the cause.",

    "News_title":"Tourists evacuated from Crete as heatwave punishes Europe",
    "News_text":"Thousands of people have evacuated the Greek island of Crete to escape a rapidly spreading wildfire threatening homes and hotels.\n\nFirefighters, with the support of water-dropping planes and helicopters, are battling the blaze, which began in the southeastern part of the island on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe wildfire came as four people died in Spain, two in France and two others in Italy during anearly summer heatwave in Europeon Wednesday.\n\nItaly issued red alerts for 18 cities, while in Germany, temperatures were forecast to peak at 40 degrees Celsius, reportedly causing motorways to buckle.\n\nWildfires have also broken out in Turkey, while two of the four people who died in Spain were killed by a blaze in Catalonia.\n\nGreece\n\nItaly\n\nGermany\n\nFrance\n\nSpain\n\nRest of Europe\n\nGale winds have fanned the flames in Greece and caused more than 1,500 people to be evacuated from the Cretian municipality of Ierapetra so far, with some evacuees taking refuge in temporary shelters.\n\nAt least 155 firefighters, along with 38 water trucks and support teams, were deployed to the area, where the fire has already caused damage to homes and hotels.\n\nNektarios Papadakis, a civil protection official at the regional authority, told the Associated Press: “It’s a very difficult situation. The fire is very hard to contain. Right now, they cannot contain it.\n\n“The tourists who were moved out are all ok. They have been taken to an indoor basketball arena and hotels in other regions of the island.”\n\nThe fire service issued a daily bulletin on Thursday, warning that the wildfire risk remains exceptionally high across Crete and parts of southern Greece as firefighters continue to battle multiple active fronts.\n\nLast month, wildfires broke out on the Greek holiday island of Chios, causing thousands to evacuate.\n\nIn Italy, there have been several fatalities. Two Italian male tourists died of heat stroke in separate incidents on beaches in Sardinia, where temperatures in recent days have exceeded 40C.\n\nMeanwhile, food delivery riders in the country have been offered more money if they agree to work in temperatures of 40C or more, an offer that has infuriated unions.\n\nThe incentive prompted a debate about safety at work as Italy swelters through an intense heatwave, with a red alert declared in around 20 cities, from Rome to Turin.\n\nGlovo, a food delivery company, sent a message to its bicycle couriers saying that if they agree to work in temperatures of 32-36C they will receive a 2% bonus.\n\nIf they sweat it out in temperatures of 36 to 40C then they can expect a 4% bonus. If they consent to work in temperatures exceeding 40C then they will get an 8% bonus.\n\nUnions said the incentives were irresponsible and endangered the safety of employees. Glovo said the extra payments are not “incentives” but a system of “compensation” for working in the sweltering heat.\n\nThe row came as Italian authorities imposed new rules to halt work in sectors such as construction and agriculture, where workers are exposed to the sun and high temperatures.\n\nBuilding site workers, manual labourers and farmworkers have been told they should not work between 12.30pm and 4pm because of the extreme heat.\n\nThe decree does not apply to delivery couriers, apart from in the northern region of Piedmont, where the regional government decided to explicitly include the sector.\n\nEven Germany is sweltering, with temperatures of up to 40C.\n\nGermany’s national weather service warned of “exceptionally high” temperatures.\n\nThe heat was causing disruptions to transport, with Germany’s national rail operator Deutsche Bahn warning of impaired services in the west of the country, where temperatures were highest.\n\nIn the north-west, close to the city of Bremen, the heat had caused the surface of the motorway to buckle in places, creating a danger for drivers, local media reported.\n\nAs well as an increased risk of forest fires, Germany’s rivers are also running low, causing problems for navigating the country’s waterways.\n\nIn the eastern city of Dresden, the level of the Elbe river has sunk to just 64 centimetres (25 inches), compared with an average of around two metres.\n\nIn France, temperatures had cooled slightly overnight into Wednesday but remained high. Paris was expected to experience highs of around 35C after hitting 40C on Tuesday, according to weather service Meteo-France.\n\nFrench Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said it was “too early to take stock” of the consequences of the heatwave.\n\nBut for the Paris metro area, there had been a “serious” increase in emergency services’ activity of around 15 percent as the mercury rose.\n\nAn official estimate of the excess mortality linked to the heatwave would take two weeks for French authorities to compile, the ministry indicated.\n\nIn Spain, people will have to wait until the weekend before they experience a drop in temperatures.\n\nA 75-year-old man died in the southern city of Cordoba, bringing the total number of heat-related deaths over the last 10 days in Spain to at least four.\n\nBarcelona adopted plans to extend protections for sanitation workers in heatwaves, including more water breaks, after a woman died Saturday following her shift.\n\nScientists say heatwaves have arrived across Europe earlier this year, spiking temperatures by up to 10 C (50 F) in some regions as warming seas encouraged the formation of a heat dome over much of Europe, trapping hot air masses. Last year was the planet’s hottest on record.\n\nTurkey, which battled blazes on several fronts, forcing the temporary evacuation of about 50,000 people earlier in the week, said its fires were largely contained.\n\nHowever, fires continued for a second day in the country’s western coastal province of Izmir.\n\nWinds hindered firefighting efforts as the flames approached a main highway to Cesme, local TV footage showed, and thick smoke billowed over mountainous areas.\n\nIn Belgium, the Atomium attraction in Brussels, where highs of 34C were expected, was set to maintain reduced opening hours for the second day in a row on Wednesday to spare visitors from the afternoon heat.\n\nBut coastal areas in Belgium were already experiencing lower temperatures Wednesday, and cool winds blowing in from the Atlantic were expected to see highs in France drop to near 28C on Thursday.\n\nSwiss utility Axpo, meanwhile, has shut its two reactor units at the Beznau nuclear power plant due to high river water temperatures.\n\nScientists say heatwaves have arrived earlier this year, spiking temperatures by up to 10 C (50 F) in some regions as warming seas encouraged the formation of a heat dome over much of Europe, trapping hot air masses.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Firefighters were struggling Thursday to bring a major wildfire on Greece's southern island of Crete under control, hampered by gale force winds whipping up the flames.\n\nThousands of people were evacuated from hotels and homes overnight after the fire started Wednesday afternoon in the Ierapetra area on the island's southern coast, officials said.\n\nThe head of the hoteliers’ association of Ierapetra and southeastern Crete, Giorgos Tzarakis, told local media about 5,000 tourists had been evacuated from the area, and that several homes and businesses had been damaged.\n\nBy Thursday morning, 230 firefighters backed by 10 water-dropping helicopters were battling the flames advancing through forest and farmland.\n\nGale force winds in the area, with gusts reaching about 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, “are constantly creating ... new outbreaks, making firefighting work very difficult,” said fire department spokesman Vassilis Vathrakogiannis.\n\nTwo people were evacuated by boat overnight, while six private boats were on standby in case further evacuations by sea became necessary, the coast guard said.\n\nNektarios Papadakis, a civil protection official at the regional authority, told The Associated Press overnight that tourists who had been evacuated from the area had been taken to an indoor basketball arena and hotels in other parts of the island.\n\nSeveral residents were treated for breathing difficulties, officials said, but there were no reports of serious injuries.\n\nThe Fire Service and a civil protection agency issued mobile phone alerts for the evacuations and appealed to residents not to return to try to save their property.\n\nAs fires crested ridgelines and edged toward residential areas overnight, the blaze sent clouds of ash into the sky, illuminated by the headlights of emergency vehicles and water trucks that lined the coastal road near the resorts of Ferma and Achlia on the southeast of Crete.\n\nCrete is one of Greece’s most popular destinations for both foreign and domestic tourists.\n\nThe risk of wildfires remained very high across Crete and parts of southern Greece Thursday, according to a daily bulletin issued by the Fire Service.\n\nWildfires are frequent in the country during its hot, dry summers, and the fire department has already tackled dozens across Greece so far this year.\n\nIn 2018, a massivefire swept through the seaside town of Mati,east of Athens, trapping people in their homes and on roads as they tried to flee.

    "News_text":"Jul. 2—MOSES LAKE — On the morning of July 2, the City of Moses Lake Fire Department was dispatched due to multiple reports of a wildfire located in the area of Penn Street and behind the Grant County Irrigation and Rehabilitation District building, north of East Wheeler Road. The fire was reported at about 10:45 a.m.\n\n\"We made a pretty quick stop of the fire,\" said Battalion Chief JR Schwendeman, who was on the scene. \"It's going to continue to burn for probably the next 24 hours in certain areas, but we're going to be in the area in the next 24 hours continuing to watch it and put out hot spots.\"\n\nDue to the rapid response, the fire was contained at 11:32 a.m. and limited to roughly five acres of land with no structural involvement or loss, and no human injury, according to an MLFD press release. The cause of the fire is undetermined.\n\nUpon arrival, the decision was made to call for assistance from mutual aid partners due to the current fire weather watch and the desire to rapidly contain the fire to limit damage, said the MLFD release. The MLFD responded with four fire suppression apparatus and two chief officers and received mutual aid from Grant County Fire District 5 with nine vehicles.\n\n\"It was in fast-moving fuels,\" said Schwendeman. \"We had a decent wind that was driving the fire and making it larger.\"\n\nWhile the cause and exact starting location of the fire is undetermined, it is thought to have started near the old Silverbow Honey Company building at 1120 E Wheeler Rd, said Schwendeman.\n\nWhile the fire was being suppressed, the public was asked to proceed with caution through the surrounding area to allow firefighters to have direct access to the fire.\n\nThe fire was reported to members of the Moses Lake Irrigation and Rehabilitation District by a customer who informed them to leave the building as the fire was approaching the property boundaries, said Sam Castro, Executive General Manager at the MLIRD. The MLIRD immediately called the authorities after being informed of the fire.\n\n\"I was really impressed with the response that we received from the city's fire department and Grant County (5) Fire Department,\" said Castro. \"Just a great job on their end for responding as quickly as they did with the amount of trucks that they did.\"\n\nThe quickness of the response from the fire departments was essential in preventing the fire from spreading, he said.\n\nThe fire trucks appeared to have some initial difficulty in getting access to the area due to the location of the fire as well as difficulty from the high level of traffic on the road, said Castro. Being certified in flagging, he then began working on traffic control and assisting in directing the firefighters to the back gates of their building to suppress the fire.\n\nHe said he was not being directed by the fire departments in his decision to begin flagging.\n\n\"I just wanted to ensure that we could direct the fire trucks to the right location, and I think everybody was just doing their part, lending a hand where they could,\" said Castro.\n\nMLIRD staff were very thankful for the service from the emergency responders on the scene. Along with the efforts from the fire departments, officers from the Moses Lake Police Department and a trooper from the Washington State Patrol were on scene to ensure the safety of the public.\n\n\"I was really proud of our emergency responders and how they suppressed the fire and continued to add water to it after it was suppressed to ensure the public safety and to ensure that this didn't flare up with the expected winds we were having this afternoon,\" said Castro. \"Amazing response from the city and county firefighting teams. We just want to recognize them and thank them sincerely.\"\n\nMoses Lake Fire Department administrators would like to remind everyone that fire fuels are very dry at this time of year and are easily ignited.

    "News_title":"Israel kills more than 300 in Gaza in 48 hours as focus intensifies on GHF",
    "News_text":"More than 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the last 48 hours, according to the Gaza Government Media Office, which says Israel has “committed 26 bloody massacres” in that period.\n\nAt least 118 Palestinians were killed and 581 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s Health Ministry said on Thursday. At least 73 of those were killed since dawn, including 33 aid seekers at the controversial Israeli and United States-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF) aid sites.\n\nThirteen people were killed when Israeli forces attacked a tent in al-Mawasi in the south, while 16 were killed and many wounded in an attack on Mustafa Hafez School, sheltering displaced people west of Gaza City, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmed Mansour, a displaced Palestinian taking shelter in the school building, said, “We woke up to fierce [Israeli] air strikes. It felt like an earthquake. People say it was a drone attack, but the sound was horrifying, relentless shelling. Missiles were so destructive that they set everything on fire. Victims were left burning for hours without help. There is no one here to save us.”\n\nThe Government Media Office statement on Thursday said the attacks over the last 48 hours had targeted civilians in shelters and displacement centres overcrowded with tens of thousands of displaced people, public rest areas, Palestinian families inside their homes, popular markets and vital civilian facilities, and starving civilians searching for food.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah on the latest killings of Palestinians near GHF aid centres, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said, “People described scenes of horror as they wait for hours just hoping to get their hands on basic food supplies, only to be met with sudden and unprovoked gunfire … I’ve been speaking to a number of survivors this morning, and they told me such heartbreaking testimonies and they shared the horrific scenes that unfolded near the GHF-run aid centres.\n\n“They told me that there was no prior warning, no prior indication – just gunfire ripping through the crowd, desperate Palestinians scattered for cover as bullets flew. They told me that emergency services and medical teams were not able to access the area due to the intensity of the gunfire … This absolutely reflects the collapse of the humanitarian landscape here in Gaza,” he added.\n\nUS contractors ostensibly guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza have been using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press news agency.\n\nTwo US contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity, said they were speaking out because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open licence to do whatever they wished.\n\nLater Thursday, GHF released a statement of denial.  “GHF launched an immediate investigation when the Associated Press first brought these allegations to our attention. Based on time-stamped video footage and sworn witness statements, we have concluded that the claims in the AP’s story are categorically false.”\n\n“At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the [Israeli military], who was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF distribution site. It was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured,” it claimed without providing evidence.\n\nA recent report from Israeli outletHaaretzdetailed Israeli troops, in their words, confirming that Israeli soldiers have deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, said the GHF is “not just to replace the humanitarian mechanism run by international organisations for decades in Gaza, but it’s also to apply maximum pressure on the civilian population”. Odeh also noted that Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said this week that too much aid is going to Gaza and that none should enter to ensure an Israeli victory.\n\nDr Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian emergency medicine doctor and professor who has provided healthcare in Gaza for more than 30 years, told Al Jazeera that the GHF operation “is part of the [Israeli military forces]’ and the Israeli government plan to ethnically cleanse and to fulfil their goal of genocide in Gaza”.\n\n“This has nothing to do with alleviating starvation in Gaza,” Gilbert said.\n\nDescribing the aid from GHF as a “drop in the ocean” and a “sham operation”, Gilbert added, “The distribution organisation is aimed at using food as bait to attract starving people, to terrorise them and to kill them. The shooting of people in food lines is a war crime.”\n\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called for investigations into the killings and wounding of Palestinians trying to access food through GHF. UNRWA notes that while it operated about 400 sites across the besieged enclave, GFH has set up only four “mega-sites”, three in the south and one in central Gaza – none in the north, where conditions are most severe. In a post on X, UNRWA called for the UN to “do the work” in distributing aid.\n\nMore than 130 humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Amnesty International, on Tuesday demanded the immediate closure of the GHF, accusing it of facilitating attacks on starving Palestinians.\n\nThe NGOs said Israeli forces and armed groups “routinely” open fire on civilians attempting to access food.\n\nSince the GHF began operations in late May, more than650 Palestinians have been killedwhile seeking aid, and nearly 4,000 have been wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas has said it is studying a new proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, but insisted it is seeking an agreement that would bring an end to Israel’s devastating war.\n\nHamas said in a statement on Wednesday that it had received proposals from the mediators and is holding talks with them to “bridge gaps” to return to the negotiating table and try to reach a ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe Palestinian group said it was aiming for an agreement that would end the Gaza war and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.\n\nThe announcement came a day after US President Donald Trump said Israel had agreed to the ceasefire proposal and urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen. Trump has been increasing pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas to broker a ceasefire and an agreement for the group to release the Israeli captives held in Gaza.",

    "News_text":"Tourists and residents on the Greek island of Crete have been forced to evacuate due to fast-moving wildfires.\n\nThe flames, whipped by gale-force winds, burned through the night and into Thursday, causing more than 1,500 people to flee hotels and homes.\n\nHere’s what you need to know if you are visiting the island or have a trip booked.\n\nWildfires have burned throughforestand farmland in Crete’s Ierapetra area on the island’s southern coast.\n\nHundreds of firefighters backed up by 10 water-dropping aircraft have been battling the flames.\n\nTwo people were evacuated by boat overnight, while six private boats were on standby in case further evacuations by sea became necessary, the coast guard said.\n\nRelated\n\nCrete, Algarve, Mallorca: Where to find Europe’s best beaches for 2025, according to travellers\n\n'Extremely interesting': Archaeologists unearth mystery stone building on site of new Crete airport\n\nHomes were reported damaged asflamesswept through hillside forests, fanned by strong winds.\n\n“It’s a very difficult situation. The fire is very hard to contain.

They have been taken to an indoor basketball arena and hotels in other regions of the island,” he said.\n\nThe Fire Service and a civil protection agency issued mobile phone alerts for the evacuations and appealed to residents not to return to try to save their property.\n\nCrete is one of Greece’s most popular destinations for both foreign and domestic tourists.\n\nThe risk of wildfires remained very high across Crete and parts of southern Greece on Thursday, according to a daily bulletin issued by the Fire Service.\n\nWildfires are frequent in the country during itshot, dry summers, and the fire department has already tackled dozens across Greece so far this year.\n\nThe UK’s Foreign Office (FCDO) advises tourists: “There is a high risk of wildfires during the summer season from April to October.

    "News_title":"‘End the ban:’ Idaho organizers start gathering signatures for abortion rights ballot initiative",
    "News_text":"On Saturday, organizers with Idahoans United for Women and Families held a rally at the Idaho State Capitol Building in downtown Boise for a new ballot initiative that seeks to establish abortion rights in Idaho. (Courtesy of Idahoans United for Women and Families)\n\nThe rallying calls were familiar.\n\nDespite dangerous pregnancy complications, women are being denied emergency abortions. Doctors are leaving the state. And politicians shouldn’t be involved in sensitive health decisions.\n\nBut one part of the pitch was new: Instead of asking state lawmakers for a fix, Idahoans can sign on to establish their own state law.\n\n“Idaho has been living under the trigger ban for nearly three years,” Melanie Folwell, lead organizer for the group behind Idaho’s abortion rights ballot initiative, told a Boise rally on Saturday. “And we have seen — and you’ll see in the stories you hear today — that it simply does not work for Idaho. It doesn’t work for anybody. So, today is the first step we are taking to end the ban.”\n\nThe effort to collect signatures for the proposed ballot initiative comes nearly three years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That reversal lifted federal court protections for abortions, letting states regulate abortion — which activated trigger abortion bans in several states, including Idaho.\n\nIdaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.\n\nDespitecalls for changein thethree years Idaho’s ban has been in place,including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largelyrefused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws.\n\nThe ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote.\n\nBut qualifying an initiative for the ballot is a tough hurdle in Idaho.\n\nIn the past decade, only three ballot initiatives have had enough signatures to qualify for the ballot: a successful Medicaid expansion initiative in 2018, a failed historical horse racing initiative in 2018, and an unsuccessful primary election reform initiative in 2024.\n\nThe group Folwell leads, Idahoans United for Women and Families, is hoping to qualify the abortion ballot initiative for the ballot in the November 2026 general election. That gives organizers about a year to collect the nearly 71,000 signatures needed.\n\nThey already collected 1,200 signatures on Saturday, when hundreds of people turned out for the rally, organizers say. And organizers are gearing up for signature collection efforts across the state soon, Folwell told the Sun, helped by their 1,000 volunteers.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nThe initiative could mean doctors and other medical professionals “will not be afraid to move to Idaho and take care of us,” Dr. Becky Uranga, an Idaho doctor, said at the rally.\n\nThat could mean several things might get better, she explained between cheers from the audience — like your longtime doctor “will stay and keep caring for you and thousands of others,” that you may be able to avoid a six-month wait to see a doctor or other medical professional, and that Idaho doctors can “again provide the needed care without the risk of criminalization hanging over our heads.”\n\n“And most of all, this could restore the sacred space between doctors and our patients. And I can honor all of your beliefs and privacy in the exam room — without any external pressures,” Uranga said.\n\nKate Campbell-Covell, a pregnant mother with two kids, told the rally about howshehad to travel to Utah after she learned her son wouldn’t survive her pregnancy.\n\n“With tears in their eyes, our extremely compassionate and loving medical team explained that due to the laws in Idaho, they were unable to render the care they deem necessary to save my life and protect my future fertility,” she said.\n\nThen she was airlifted out of state, she said.\n\nCONTACT US\n\nAfter federal court protections, St. Luke’s has said the health systemhasn’t had to air transportany patients for pregnancy complications. Before those protections, St. Luke’stransportedsix patients out of state in the first four months of 2024. The federal court protectionsonly allow emergency abortionsfor doctors at St. Luke’s.\n\nCampbell-Covell later learned that she had a severe placenta infection. If left untreated, she would have died, she said.\n\nShe had her son’s ashes sent home.\n\nKrista Doubleday signed the initiative Saturday. She says she thinks people need to understand more about how an unwanted pregnancy affects people.\n\nFor years, she worked in social work, and now works as a local therapist.\n\n“The amount of children that I saw living in absolutely horrid conditions, and from individuals that were forced to bear them from other countries, is really what radicalized me and made me pro choice,” Doubleday said.\n\nKen Harris, a local musician, also signed. He said he wants abortion access in Idaho to return to how it used to be.\n\n“That was what the case was in Idaho for 50 years. Male politicians — politicians have no business dictating to people about their private medical decisions and feelings,” Harris told the Sun. “A woman’s opinion about what she should do with her body — for her own health, for her family — should be her decision alone.”\n\nTo qualify for the ballot, the group needs at least 70,725 qualifying signatures from Idaho registered voters. That figure is 6% of Idaho’s nearly 1.2 million registered voters in the 2024 general election — spread across half of the state’s 35 legislative districts.\n\nBut signature gathering efforts were delayed by almost six months after initiative organizerslegally challengeddescriptions state officials developed about the initiative for voters to see, Folwell told the Sun. The descriptions are featured on signature gathering forms.\n\nLast month, the Idaho Supreme Courtorderedthe Idaho Attorney General’s Office and the Idaho Division of Financial Management to redraft the descriptions.\n\nThe newshortballot title describes the initiative as a “measure creating right to abortion before fetus viability, and post-viability to protect health; right to privacy; healthcare provider liability protections.”\n\nThe initiative would raise state expenses by less than one thousandth of a percent of Idaho’s share of the Medicaid budget, or between $3,100 and $7,800 each year, the initiative’s redrafted fiscal impact statement says.\n\n“This impact is derived from the costs of treating chemical abortion complications for women enrolled in Idaho’s Medicaid program,” the fiscal impact statement says. “Medicaid covers medically necessary services to treat complications from all abortions. It is anticipated that as legal abortions increase, the complications will also increase. This will likely result in an increase in Medicaid covered services and expenditures to treat complications from chemical abortions, which the State has reliable and readily available data to support.”\n\nThe new fiscal impact statement also no longer includes the entire Medicaid services budget of $850 million in fiscal year 2024.\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "News_text":"Gov. Andy Beshear signs a proclamation in the Capitol Rotunda making October 2024 Domestic Violence Awareness Month in Kentucky. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)\n\nIf you or someone you know has experienced domestic violence, call the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673. Call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.You can also contact any ofKentucky’s 15 domestic violence programs.\n\nMost perpetrators and victims of domestic violence in Kentucky are between the ages of 25 and 39, the annualDomestic Violence Data Reportshows.\n\nThe 2024 report, released Monday, shows about 9% of domestic violence perpetrators are between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nOlivia Spradlin, a policy expert at ZeroV, (formerly known as the Kentucky Coalition Against Domestic Violence), said that while ZeroV staff are still examining the report, that 9% data point stood out.\n\n“Oftentimes we talk about children living in domestic violence and witnessing it and getting in between parents,” Spradlin said. “That number, I think, stood out to us, though, from an aspect of: these are children who are already committing intimate partner violence. That feels like an area to think more about, in terms of prevention and healthy dating.”\n\nKentucky also has high rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which are traumas a person experiences before turning 18. Research published in the National Library of Medicine in 2022 suggestsa link between experiencing trauma and violent behavior.\n\n“While risk factors can be linked to a greater likelihood of using violence, they are not necessarily direct causes,” Spradlin said. “The DV data report does not have information that can speak to those risk and protective factors; that is an area that would need more inquiry.”\n\nThe report also shows most domestic violence perpetrators are men and most victims are women. Of Kentuckians who sought a protective order, the report shows 69% received some type of order and 21% were denied.\n\nThe state began gathering this data in compliance with a 2022 Republicanbillthat directed agencies to annually gather and publish data on domestic and dating violence and abuse.\n\nData in it comes from the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet’s Criminal Justice Statistical Analysis Center, Kentucky State Police, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n\nAt least 44.5% of women and 32.9% of men in Kentucky have experienced contact sexual violence, physical violence and\/or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime, according to the report.\n\n“In Kentucky, while progress continues, challenges remain, particularly when analyzing data sourced from multiple systems designed for varying purposes,” the report says.\n\nThose challenges include different organizations using different terminology and definitions and the lack of a “formal statewide surveillance system” to identify domestic violence deaths.\n\nBecause of that gap, “this report cannot provide a definitive count ofKentuckians who have died due to domestic or dating violence,” it says.\n\n“Far too many Kentuckians experience domestic violence,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. “That’s why it has been a top priority of my administration to make our commonwealth a safer place for all our families, and to make sure victim services are available across the commonwealth. Through working with partners, we are able to help Kentuckians in need while working together to bring justice.”\n\nThe report shows that in Kentucky last year:\n\n32,899 electronicJC-3forms (documenting alleged violence) were filed. This is a small increase from2023, when  32,885 were filed.\n\nThose reports resulted in 7,964 arrests, an increase from 7,759 the year prior.\n\nDespite more arrests, some convictions were down.\n\nThere were 4,088 convictions for 4th degree domestic violence assault, a decrease from 4,196 in 2023.\n\nThere were 100 convictions for 4th degree domestic violence assault by offenders facing their third or offense in five years. That is a 9% decrease from 2023, when there were 110 such convictions.\n\nThere were 82 convictions of 2nd Degree Domestic Violence Assault, down from 105 in 2023.\n\nThere were 12 convictions for 1st Degree Domestic Violence Assault, the same as in 2023.\n\nThere were 17,023 emergency protective orders (EPO) and temporary interpersonal protective orders (TIPO) served in 2024, down from 17,036 in 2023.\n\nThere were 14,187 reports of alleged child abuse\/neglect to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) that also included intimate partner violence.\n\nMore people got services from ZeroV’s 15 programs — 15, 386 in 2024 compared with 15,104 in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, a Northern Kentucky Republican unsuccessfully tried to pass a law that would have givenvictims of coercive control access to  protective orderswithout first having to experiencephysical violence or face immediate threatof physical violence.Coercive controlis a more nuanced type of abuse in which one person exerts control over another through isolation, threats, surveillance, loss of financial freedom and medical access and more.\n\nThe report acknowledges that “not all harmful or abusive behavior meets the threshold for criminal charges or protective orders.”\n\n“Behaviors such as restricting access to privacy or sleep, micromanaging daily activities, threatening suicide or consistently undermining one’s parenting are profoundly damaging,” but  “may not be recognized as domestic violence in a legal context.”\n\nSpradlin said ZeroV “has supported adding coercive control to protective orders” but “we would remain very attentive to the implementation process for unintended consequences.”\n\nShe said accessing housing is also a “huge barrier” for survivors of domestic violence.\n\n“Housing, right now, is a huge issue for survivors — and affordable housing and dignified housing and housing that folks want to live in,” she said. “If a survivor can’t find housing, they can’t financially support themselves when they leave.”\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_text":"Rising demand is not always a good thing.\n\nIncreasing demand for emergency food assistance means more of our neighbors are hungry. And yet, the proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits contained in the budget reconciliation legislation being advanced through Congress will result in historic reductions in benefits that low-income, sick and hungry people receive at a time when Forgotten Harvest and our partner food pantries are already struggling with the existing demand for our services.\n\nThe budget reconciliation bill proposes approximately $4 trillion in tax cuts that are offset by $1.8 trillion in federal spending cuts -$1.2 trillion of which comes from the SNAP and Medicaid programs.\n\nMichigan food banks distributed 155.8 million meals last year. The cuts to SNAP contained in the budget reconciliation bill could result in Michigan families losing the equivalent of 284 million meals. That is an increase in demand that far outstrips the existing emergency food system’s capacity. Hunger is going to increase among our fellow Michiganders because of this legislation.\n\nProponents of this legislation contend that the federal government is not reducing funding and that the changes that are being made are intended to eliminate fraud and waste.\n\nNeither of these statements are true. Congress is proposing to shift up to15-25% of the SNAP program costsand 25% of the administrative costs to the states.This will result in a new$900 million annual costto the State of Michigan’s budget – a cost that can only be paid by raising taxes or taking SNAP food assistance benefits away from people.\n\nThe biggest source of fraud in the existing SNAP program comes from thieves electronically stealing the benefits paid to SNAP recipients because Congress has not authorizedproperly encrypting SNAP benefit cards.\n\nThere are 1.474 million Michigan residentswhose net household income is at or below the federal poverty threshold($32,150 for a family of four), who are receiving SNAP benefits. This number includes 461,000 children and 225,000 senior citizens; 67% of SNAP beneficiaries also depend on Medicaid for health coverage.\n\nThere is nothing beautiful about making poor people both hungrier and sicker.

(From Morales' official X account)\n\nFollowing months of scrutiny over millions in no-bid contracts, the Indiana Secretary of State’s Office has quietly started issuing formal requests for proposals (RFPs).\n\nThe move also comes on the heels ofa new law adopted by the General Assembly earlier this yearto increase transparency requirements around state contracting.\n\nAs of July, nearly a dozen RFPs were listed on the Secretary of State’s (SOS)”contracting opportunities” webpage.They include requests for vendors to handle call center services, maintain and modernize cloud-hosted software platforms, and redesign division websites.\n\nMost of the RFPs were posted in late May with submission deadlines in early to mid-July.\n\nOne RFP calls for a third-party call center to manage tens of thousands of calls annually across the agency’s Business Services and Auto Dealer Services divisions, including responding to 6,500 to 11,000 monthly customer calls; escalating complex cases; and storing call recordings that include sensitive personal data. The vendor would be expected to meet daily performance benchmarks and provide regular reporting to the state, according to the RFP.\n\nMultiple proposals also seek vendors to maintain and upgrade “critical” software systems that run key parts of the office’s work — ranging from business filings and notary applications to securities oversight.\n\nThe office is requesting applications from firms with experience in cloud-based architecture, cybersecurity, workflow automation and artificial intelligence to help reengineer its existing tools and build new ones with an emphasis on performance and user accessibility.\n\nAnother RFP asks for help creating content for a redesigned INBiz portal, while others seek outside firms to evaluate and strengthen the office’s IT security protocols; develop website infrastructure; manage project compliance; and monitor contract execution.\n\nThe new listings followreporting by the Indiana Capital Chronicle in Decemberthat revealed Secretary of State Diego Morales had awarded more than $3.3 million in contracts without a competitive bidding process. Some of those contracts went to politically connected vendors who gave tens of thousands of dollars to Morales’ reelection campaign.\n\nMorales and his office have defended those arrangements, previously telling the Capital Chronicle that the agency “opted to pursue vendors with strong track records, and commercially competitive proposals in lieu of public bidding.”\n\nSecretary of state spending includes millions in no-bid contracts\n\nBut during a June 18 State Budget Committee meeting, he faced further scrutiny from state lawmakers about the no-bid contracts — along with a myriad of other controversies — while seeking more than $10 million in funds for his office.\n\nThe other controversies included Morales’ purchase of a $90,000 car with taxpayer moneyfrom a campaign contributorandhiring his brother-in-law.\n\nMorales emphasized that no-bid agreements were awarded by the secretary of state’s office before he was elected. He said they were legal — sometimes necessary, when on tight deadlines — and that under his watch, only “companies with experience” received contracts.\n\nEven so, Republican Sen. Chris Garten pressed Morales on previous no-bid contracts awarded to companies that made campaign contributions, saying “Indiana constituents deserve to know” such details.\n\nMorales held that “lots of people” donate to his political efforts.\n\n“We’ve been following no-bid contracting that has been done for the past 20 years. I’m not doing anything different,” Morales said. “This let us look for companies that are experts in what they do … and they’re getting the job done … and we’re saving taxpayer money by hiring the best of the best in the business.”\n\nFollowing passage ofSenate Enrolled Act 5— a new law thatbans non-public, no-bid state contractsand increases oversight of agency spending — the secretary of state said the agency is overhauling its internal processes to ensure compliance.\n\nChief Legal Counsel Jerry Bonnet told the state budget committee that while the secretary of state’s office “historically (was) not bidding” contracts or IT work or other services, “they’re all now going up for the bid process.”\n\n“We’re taking a considerable amount of time talking to vendors now,” Bonnet said. “So, we’ve embraced the emergency that was declared by Senate Bill 5 to start putting all these contracts out for public procurement.”\n\nCONTACT US\n\nThe bulk of the agency’s latest funding request, nearly $8.2 million, is earmarked for technology and security improvements.\n\nBonnet said a new chief information officer, who joined the office in 2023, assessed the IT systems and concluded that the “antiquated systems … (were) in danger of failing.” Improving that part of the office has created “a high spending curve” that Bonnet said would fall at the beginning of next year to between $4-5 million.\n\nIt’s not yet clear how much the new RFPs will be settled for, but Bonnet said the office has “already been able to negotiate discounts with some vendors.”\n\n“The bidding process is great, but it takes quite a bit of time to then take something and pick it apart and do all those details, specifications, advertise it, talk to all the different vendors,” he added. “We’re trying to do more with less.”\n\nBonnet said the office is also seeking to contract with a consultant to help navigate and manage new requirements enacted under Senate Enrolled Act 5.\n\n“Before we make any new contracts, we’re going to hopefully have a professional contractor … an independent expert, to make those contract assessments,” he noted. “It’ll be a rush, but we’ll be working in the coming weeks and months to try and keep our IT projects on track.”\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

Catherine Cortez Masto is warning Nevadans that President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cut bill will ripple through every aspect of the state’s health care system, going far beyond those who directly rely on Medicaid.\n\nHospitals are already assessing whether they may need to cut staff or reduce services, said Cortez Masto during a Wednesday virtual roundtable with representatives from University Medical Center, Nevada Hospital Association, and Northern Nevada HOPES to discuss the legislation.\n\nThey all agreed such cuts would have a cascading effect on anyone needing medical treatment.\n\nLee derides Big Beautiful Bill’s Medicaid cuts: ‘People will lose their health care’\n\nThat is on top of the direct impact of the proposed Medicaid cuts, which providers have warned will result in delayed care, lost access to lifesaving medical treatments and possible closures of facilities.\n\n“It is going to devastate health care in Nevada,” Cortez Masto said.\n\nThe House is expected to vote on the amended version of “Big Beautiful Bill,” whichnarrowly passed the Senateon Tuesday. Cortez Masto and the entire Senate Democratic caucus voted against the bill, as did three Republican senators.\n\nAmong the GOP-backed megabill’s various provisions are $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years.\n\n“All of this is happening so that Republicans and President Trump can pay for billions of dollars in tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans,” Cortez Masto said.\n\nThe legislation is estimated to kick around 17 million Americans off Medicaid or Affordable Care Act coverage, with about 114,500 Nevadans at risk of losing their health care, she said.\n\nAmong the nearly 738,000 enrolled in Medicaid in Nevada, 39% are children and 15% have chronic conditions,according to KFF.\n\nNevada has a long history of low Medicaid reimbursement rates for healthcare providers.\n\nRepublicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running\n\nIn 2023, Nevada’s private hospitals agreed to pay what’s known as a “provider tax” that funds Medicaid and helps the state access additional federal matching dollars.\n\nThe current rate brings Nevada around $830 million each year.\n\nThat would change if the bill is passed. According to Nevada Hospital Association President Pat Kelly, payment amounts would be reduced “by about 30%, starting in 2028,” resulting in a reduction of around $618 million in funding annually.\n\n“When you get to this low level, the program may need to be terminated by about January 1, 2030 to avoid major cash flow risks for our acute care hospitals,” Kelly said. “We agreed to pay 15% of the provider fee money to support behavioral health care services, and that will get cut as well.”\n\nBecause of many last-minute changes to the bill that were introduced in a 27-hour voting session, Kelly said the association is still assessing just “how devastating the impact is going to be to the provider fee program.”\n\nBeatrice Nortey, a pediatric nurse who relies on Medicaid to treat her sickle cell disease, said these cuts go beyond numbers.\n\nMany of the children in her care rely on Medicaid to pay for the oxygen tanks, suction tubes, and mobility devices.\n\nThese “items that aren’t optional but necessary to keep them alive and out of the hospital,” she said. “When Medicaid is cut, these children face delays or denials in getting equipment they need, which can lead to unnecessary suffering, emergency room visits and even death.”\n\nNevada has long faced a shortage of health care providers and consistently “ranks near the bottom nationally for primary care doctors and mental health care professionals per capita,” said Dr. Ketan Patel, the medical director of UMC.\n\nThe bill, he said, would make those deficits even more pronounced.\n\n“When Medicaid gets cut, reimbursement rates drop,” Patel said. “That drives even more doctors to opt out of seeing these patients entirely.”\n\nJennifer Wakem, the CFO of UMC, said around 42% of patients that come in for inpatient care rely on Medicaid.\n\n“To stay afloat financially, it would mean we potentially would cut services offered,” Wakem said. “If we chose not to go down that path, we would likely reach out to” Clark County “for additional subsidies to keep UMC open. That, of course, ultimately gets paid by taxpayers.”\n\nThe bill will likely hurt people who use private insurance.\n\nIn a strained health system, those individuals would likely see premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar, Cortez Masto said, adding that Nevadans receiving coverage through the Affordable Care Act “could see premiums rise by $705 per year.”\n\n“More people now are going to be showing up in our emergency rooms with acute care because they now have lost the health care that they need to even provide preventative care for them,” she said.",

The goal? Keep drivers safe and crack down on dangerous behaviors like speeding, drunk driving, and ignoring the state’s Move Over, Slow Downlaw.\n\n“The Fourth of July is a time to celebrate our freedoms with family and friends, but safety must come first,” said Highway Patrol Chief Bryan Rippee in a recentannouncementfrom the DPS. “Whether you’re on the road, on the water or handling fireworks, make smart choices that protect you and those around you. Let’s work together to ensure everyone has a safe and happy Independence Day.”\n\nLast year’s Fourth of July crackdown was no small effort:troopers handed out over 59,000 citations and warnings.\n\nIn total, that included more than 5,000 tickets for speeding, over 1,500 citations for drivers without insurance, and hundreds of additional violations for those not wearing seatbelts. The DPS alsoarrested 212 people for driving while intoxicatedand250 more on various felony charges.\n\nThis year, DPS is urging drivers to plan ahead if they’re drinking, always buckle up, and avoid distractions behind the wheel, aka no texting or fiddling with apps while driving.\n\nAnd don’t forget to slow down and move over for emergency vehicles and tow trucks stopped on the road;it’s not just courteous, it’s the law.\n\nAlong with a focus on enhancing road safety, the department is also reminding Texans tohandle fireworks responsibly.\n\nSome of their precautions include: Lighting them only in open areas away from buildings, always having water handy, and never letting young kids handle fireworks. After your firework show, it is also recommended to soak all used fireworks in water before tossing them out.\n\nFirework injuries tend to run rampant on July 4th.\n\nIn 2024,11 people died in incidents involving fireworks, with most of those tragedieslinkedto improper use or malfunctioning fireworks, per the Consumer Product Safety Commission. That same year, an estimated14,700 individuals sustained injuries from fireworks– a big jump of around 38% in fatalities and 52% in injuries compared to 2023.\n\nSparklers alone accounted for about 1,700 emergency room visits in 2024.",

    "News_title":"Israel fundraising org. chair announces ‘unique’ multi-sector alliance to boost war-time aid",
    "News_text":"“We are not here to replace the government or let it off the hook,” Chairman Sam Grundwerg said. “We’re here to complement, to reinforce, to close the gaps.”\n\nIn the days following theOctober 7attacks, the grief across Israel was matched only by the urgency to respond.\n\nWhile national institutions scrambled to regain footing, a quieter, parallel front opened around the world—from Toronto to Santiago, Melbourne to Paris, asJewish communitiesand supporters of Israel mobilized with startling speed.\n\nTheir collective response, channeled through organizations like Keren Hayesod – United Israel Appeal, marked a defining chapter in global Jewish philanthropy.\n\n“It was unbelievable,” said Sam Grundwerg, the organization’s World Chairman, in a telephone interview earlier this week. “We saw an immediate stepping up to the plate by our campaigns around the world. It was generosity—not just of the wallet, but of the heart.”\n\nIronically, the year had started with pessimism. “2023, up until October 7, was looking like a pretty poor year,” Grundwerg recalled. “The internal division in Israel, protests, political paralysis, had caused real hesitation among donors. Not because they were taking sides, but because it created this general unease.”\n\nThen came the atrocities of October 7, and with them, an overnight shift. “Suddenly, all that apprehension disappeared. We saw the purest form of solidarity.”\n\nKeren Hayesod, which operates campaigns in over 45 countries, saw its fundraising surge beyond expectations. From a typical annual average of $180 million, the organization raised over $220 million in 2023, with most of the boost occurring in the final quarter.\n\n“We were heading for a big drop. Instead, we had a 25% increase,” said Grundwerg. “And what’s more, 2024 brought in over $200 million as well. That's not just a spike, it’s a statement of commitment.”\n\nOne of the lesser-told stories of the crisis was how Israel’s local governments became primary responders. With national agencies overwhelmed, municipalities from Sderot to Kiryat Shmona were left to care for displaced residents, organize emergency shelters, and tend to traumatized communities.\n\nHere, Keren Hayesod stepped in, not as an outsider, but as a long-time partner.\n\n“We’ve worked for decades with local municipalities and regional councils, so we didn’t have to start building relationships in a crisis,” Grundwerg explained. “When things fell apart, we were already there.”\n\nSince the war began, more than $18.5 million has been funneled directly to local authorities, $13.5 million to the south, where the attacks first struck, and over $5 million to the north, where tens of thousands were later evacuated.\n\n“We moved fast. Municipal leaders told us, frankly, they didn’t even know the full extent of their needs, they just knew they were overwhelmed. So in those initial weeks, we provided flexible, immediate funding, like oxygen,” he said.\n\nDespite the scale of the donations, Grundwerg is adamant about the role of philanthropy. “We are not here to replace the government or let it off the hook,” he said. “We’re here to complement, to reinforce, to close the gaps.”\n\n“The state rebuilds homes. We help rebuild communities,” he added. “Resilience centers, trauma clinics, daycare facilities, community halls, that’s where our impact is most profound.”\n\nWhen asked for a concrete example, Grundwerg turned to trauma services in the Eshkol region. “We had campaigns that wanted to focus on mental health. And Eshkol, which was hit so directly, had pressing needs, not just for children but for adults as well. We’re proud of the work there.”\n\nUnlike some global funders, Keren Hayesod doesn’t wire blank checks. “Generally, funds are tied to specific projects, with monitoring and reporting,” Grundwerg explained. “We have a professional team that follows up, tracking milestones, ensuring impact, updating donors.”\n\nStill, flexibility was crucial in the early weeks. “We understood this was not business as usual. So while we usually earmark funds for defined purposes, we also knew municipalities needed freedom to breathe.”\n\nThis dual approach, structured yet adaptive, allowed local governments to respond fast without losing accountability. And it fostered a deeper bond with communities in crisis.\n\n“We stay in touch constantly,” Grundwerg said. “Even today, we’re still talking with mayors in the south and north. We bring our donors there so they can see the impact and understand what’s still missing.”\n\nOne of the most ambitious initiatives born from the crisis is Yisrael Mitgayeset (“Israel Rising”), a multi-sector alliance bridging government ministries, the business world, and philanthropic partners like Keren Hayesod.\n\n“It’s a unique partnership,” said Grundwerg. “We signed a memorandum with the Finance Ministry before Passover. Together, we’re working to leverage resources—sometimes tripling every shekel through coordinated investment.”\n\n“There’s a real chance here to build a model—one where the state, civil society, and private donors work in sync. Not overlapping, not waiting. Acting,” Grundwerg said.\n\nWhat makes this moment especially poignant for Grundwerg is how global donors have remained engaged, even as Jewish communities abroad face their own battles—from antisemitism to security concerns.\n\n“It’s been hard abroad, too. Jewish schools under threat, protests, rising hate,” he said. “We were worried communities would pull back, focus inward. But they didn’t.”\n\n“Despite their own challenges, they’ve stepped up, time and again. No donor fatigue. Just continued love and support for Israel. That’s been truly inspiring.”\n\nAs Israel faces a drawn-out conflict and an uncertain recovery timeline, organizations like Keren Hayesod are now shifting to long-term planning, with an emphasis on communal resilience, education, and economic rehabilitation.\n\n“We’re in year three now,” Grundwerg noted. “2023, 2024, and now 2025. And our goal is the same: help Israel’s communities not just survive, but thrive.”",

    "News_title":"Supreme Court to decide if federal law bars transgender athletes from women's teams",
    "News_text":"The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to weigh in on the growing controversy over transgender athletes and decide if federal law bars transgender girls from women's school sports teams.\n\n\"Biological boys should not compete on girls' athletics teams,\" West Virginia Atty. Gen. JB McCuskey said in an appeal the court voted to hear.\n\nThe appeal had the backing of 26 other Republican-led states as well as President Trump.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump threatened to cut off education funds to Californiabecause a transgender athlete participated in a women's track and field competition.\n\nFour years ago, West Virginia adopted its Save Women's Sports Act but the measure has beenblocked as discriminatoryby the 4th Circuit Court in 2-1 decision.\n\nIdahofiled a similar appealafter its law was blocked by the 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco. The court said it would hear that case together with the West Virginia case.\n\nAt issue is the meaning ofTitle IX, the federal education law that has been credited with opening the door for the vast expansion of women's sports. Schools and colleges were told they must give girls equal opportunities in athletics by providing them with separate sports teams.\n\nIn the past decade, however, states and their schools divided on the question of who can participate on the girls team. Is it only those who were girls at birth or can it also include those whose gender identity is female?\n\nRead more:California violated civil rights of female students by allowing trans athletes to compete, feds say\n\nWest Virginiatold the courtits \"legislature concluded that biological boys should compete on boys’ and co-ed teams but not girls’ teams. This separation made sense, the legislature found, because of the 'inherent physical differences between biological males and biological females'.\"\n\nCalifornia and most Democratic states allow transgender girls to compete in sports competitions for women.\n\nIn 2013, the Legislature said a student \"shall be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions...consistent with his or her gender identity.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court had put off a decision on this issue while the divide among the states grew.\n\nMcCuskey, West Virginia's attorney general, said he was confident the court would uphold the state's law. “It is time to return girls’ sports to the girls and stop this misguided gender ideology once and for all,” he said in a statement.\n\nLawyers for Lambda Legal and the ACLU said the court should not uphold exclusionary laws.\n\n“Our client just wants to play sports with her friends and peers,” said Sasha Buchert, director of Non-Binary and Transgender Rights Project at Lambda Legal.\n\n“Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,\" said Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project. \"We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”\n\nTwo years ago, the justices turned down a fast-track appeal from West Virginia's lawyers on a 7-2 vote andallowed a 12-year old transgender girl to run on the girls' cross countryteam.\n\nBecky Pepper-Jackson and her mother sued after the school principal said she was barred by the state's law from competing on the girls’ teams at her middle school in Bridgeport, W. Va.\n\nShe “has lived as a girl in all aspects of her life for years and receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy, so has not experienced (and will not experience) endogenous puberty,” her mother said in support of their lawsuit.\n\nACLU lawyers said then the court should stand aside. They said B.P.J. was eager to participate in sports but was \"too slow to compete in the track events\" on the girls team.\n\nLast year, West Virginia tried again and urged the Supreme Court to review the 4th Circuit's decision and uphold its restrictions on transgender athletes.\n\nThe state attorneys also claimed the would-be middle school athlete had become a track star.\n\n\"This spring, B.P.J. placed top three in every track event B.P.J. competed in, winning most. B.P.J. beat over 100 girls, displacing them over 250 times while denying multiple girls spots and medals in the conference championship. B.P.J. won the shot put by more than three feet while placing second in discus,\" they told the court.\n\nLast year, the court opted to rule first in a Tennessee case to decide if states may prohibit puberty blockers, hormones and other medical treatments for young teens who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\n\nRead more:Supreme Court upholds red-state laws that ban hormones for transgender teens\n\nOn June 18, the court's conservative majority said state lawmakers had the authority to restrict medical treatments for adolescents who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, noting the ongoing debate over the long-term risks and benefits. The ruling turned aside the contention that law reflected unconstitutional sex discrimination.\n\nOn Thursday, the justices released their final orders list before their summer recess granting review of new cases to be heard in the fall. Included were the cases of West Virginia vs. BJP and Little vs. Hecox.\n\nIn response to the appeals, ACLU lawyers accused the state of seeking to \"create a false sense of national emergency\" based on a legal \"challenge by one transgender girl.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said the state measure was \"part of a concerted nationwide effort to target transgender youth for unequal treatment.\" The suit contended the law violated Title IX and was unconstitutional because it discriminated against student athletes based on their gender identity.\n\nWest Virginia's lawyers saw a threat to Title IX and women's sports.\n\nThey said the rulings upholding transgender rights \"took a law designed to ensure meaningful competitive opportunities for women and girls—based on biological differences — and fashioned it into a lever for males to force their way onto girls’ sports teams based on identity, destroying the very opportunities Title IX was meant to protect.\"\n\nGet the L.A.

    "News_text":"BERLIN (AP) — A man on a long-distance train in southern Germany attacked and slightly injured four people with a hammer Thursday before he was detained by police, authorities said.\n\nPolice in Straubing said the attack happened on an ICE express train headed from the northern Germany city of Hamburg to the Austrian capital of Vienna while it was between Straubing and Plattling in the southern state of Bavaria.\n\nAbout 500 people were on board when the attack happened, police said. About 150 police officers, firefighters and emergency personnel were deployed to the scene, police added. The railway line was closed down.\n\nPolice initially said the perpetrator used an axe in the attack but later said he allegedly used a hammer and likely other weapons which they did not further name.\n\nThey identified the suspect as a 20-year-old Syrian national.\n\nThree of the four injured passengers also were Syrians, a boy of 15 and two men aged 24 and 51. The fourth victim was a 38-year-old passenger whose nationality was not yet known, police said. All four injured passengers were taken to nearby hospitals.\n\nPolice did not provide further details on the identity of the attacker or his motive, but later said that he was overpowered by fellow passengers and had also been injured.\n\nThe perpetrator “is probably somewhat more seriously injured,\" a police spokesperson told German news agency dpa. He was in police custody and receiving medical treatment.\n\nAccording to the Bavarian Red Cross, the emergency services were alerted at around 2 p.m. local time, after passengers pulled the emergency brakes. The train came to a halt near the village of Straßkirchen, dpa reported.\n\nThe Red Cross said a special care center was set up nearby to take care of passengers. In addition to numerous rescue services and two helicopters, psychological caregivers were deployed to help those who were not injured but might have been traumatized.\n\nGerman rail operator Deutsche Bahn said in a statement that “our thoughts and sympathy are with the injured and all those who now have to come to terms with what they have experienced,\" and thanked emergency services for the quick arrest of the suspect.\n\nGermany has seen several violent attacks in public spaces in recent months.\n\nIn May,a woman stabbed and injured more than a dozenpeople at Hamburg's central station. In February,a driver plowed into a demonstration in Munich, killing two and injuring more than 20.\n\nIn December,a man killed six and injured more than 200when he drove a car through a Christmas market in Magdeburg.",

    "News_text":"A nine-year-old child died in Texas on Tuesday after being left alone in a car, authorities say.\n\nThe tragedy occurred in the gated employee parking lot of an industrial complex in Galena Park. The child's mother had left her daughter in a vehicle while she began her 6 a.m. shift at the USG office, according to police. The identities of the mother and the child were not released to the public.\n\nDuring a news conference, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez explained the child had been left with some water, with the vehicle's windows partially down and sunshades up. He guessed the girl had remained there until her mother's shift ended at 2 p.m.\n\n\"I don't know if anyone checked on the child throughout the day,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nUpon returning to the car, the mother found the child unresponsive and alerted first responders at 2:06 p.m. Despite life-saving efforts by emergency personnel, the child was pronounced dead upon arriving at a hospital. Gonzalez confirmed her mother had been detained and questioned, but it remains unclear if she will face charges for her daughter's death.\n\n\"You can be sympathetic to her situation,\" Gonzalez said, clarifying that investigators did not know why the girl accompanied her mother to work. \"It's never acceptable to leave a child in the car.\"\n\nTwo other Texas children died in separate incidents after being left in hot vehicles over the weekend,according to data by Kids and Car Safety. The child's death in Galena Park marks the 13th in the U.S. in 2025.\n\nSweltering Texas summers are here:10 things you should never leave in a hot car or truck\n\nIt’s never safe to leave children or pets unattended in a vehicle — not even for a few minutes, not even in your own driveway, and not even with the air conditioning running on remote start. In Texas, it's also illegal to leave a child alone in a car for more than five minutes if they’re under the age of 7.However, it's even more dangerous on hot days, when the risk can turn deadly quickly, as interior temperatures can soar to life-threatening levels in just a matter of minutes.\n\nOver the past 25 years, more than 1,010 children have died of heatstroke after they were left or were trapped in a hot car. In 2018 and 2019, there were a record number of hot car deaths, with 53 children dying each year, the most in at least 25 years, according toNoHeatStroke.org.\n\n— ABC Houston contributed to this report.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Austin American-Statesman:Texas girl, 9, dies after mother allegedly left her in car for 8 hours",

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda\/States Newsroom)\n\nAmong the North Carolinians who will have the stability of their lives disrupted by the massive Medicaid funding cuts and policy changes making their way through Congress right now in the so-called “one big, beautiful bill” are many of the people I and my colleagues work to assist at the Raleigh-based nonprofit, Healing Transitions.\n\nAsour websiteexplains, Healing Transitions offers innovative peer-based, recovery-oriented services to homeless, uninsured and underserved individuals with alcoholism and other drug addictions. Our program is specifically designed to rekindle a person’s desire and ability to return to a meaningful and productive life.\n\nOver the last year, we have made some especially encouraging progress by getting clients with medical issues enrolled in Medicaid. Now, when they finish the program after a year or more, they leave with a job, drug-free housing, connectivity to the recovery community, and a relationship with a primary care physician through Medicaid coverage. The latter arrangement results in better management of chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. These men and women have less emergency visits and less hospitalizations.\n\nUnfortunately, under the terms of giant budget reconciliation bill advancing in Washington, this progress is in jeopardy. Under the Medicaid changes contained in the legislation, enrollees will be subject to new work requirements and mandated to undergo periodic re-registration to verify their employment. While work requirements themselves will not be a problem for our clients, the administrative hassle of complying will undoubtedly cause problems.\n\nThe inevitable result: Medicaid coverage will lapse in some cases and so too will the patient’s relationship with their primary care physician and their management of health issues. Health care costs will inevitably increase, and health quality will decline.\n\nIn the few states where work requirements for Medicaid coverage have been previously implemented, administrative costs have exceeded savings in health care expenditures. Also, deficient compliance with these administrative steps have brought interruption of Medicaid coverage.\n\nIn the United States, we spend twice as much per person as other industrialized nations on health care, and we have worse health outcomes. Our average life expectancy is lower, and we have more preventable deaths. We are the only industrialized nation without health insurance in one form or another for all citizens. Why can we not learn from those examples?\n\nSadly, the proposed Medicaid cuts will double down on our failed model. With congressional approval of this “big, beautiful bill” our nation will move in the wrong direction when it comes to both health care costs and health outcomes.\n\nDo we care? By all indications, far too many of our elected leaders do not.",

The SBA announced the grant at its June 23 quarterly meeting, where they approved $11 million total for school facility and infrastructure projects around the state. The one million the county received was the maximum it could apply for. The award itself was part of a total of $23 million awarded to W.

The timeline is currently open.\n\n“We will advertise for an architect and contractor as next steps,” School Superintendent Donna Heston said. “We work to not impede the instructional day like with East Dale and Watson, which were performed during summer months.”\n\nBoyles said the Board of Education will have a meeting on Aug. 10 to discuss the Comprehensive Educational Facilities Plan and determine if any modifications need to be made to it. Currently, the school district is finishing up with the turf replacement at East-West Stadium, Boyles said, and progress continues on the County’s Safe Schools Entrances at several of its educational facilities. For the past three years, the school district has been working to fortify its buildings in partnership with the Marion County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management and the Marion County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nThe school district is also working on its recovery from the Father’s Day Flood. Boyles said an insurance claim for the damage to school system facilities is forthcoming.\n\n“It’s critical we get those, particularly the four schools that were impacted,” Boyles said. “Barrackville, the two Monongah schools and some of the other schools that are minor in nature. But we’ve already started working on that. I just got a report today that Barrackville seems to be all cleaned out now and sanitized. We want to get on track to get those two schools, middle and elementary, done here in July.”\n\nThe June 15 flood dumped up to 4 inches of water in some area of Marion County and caused streets in different parts of town to flood with rushing waters.",

    "News_title":"Supreme Court takes up bans on transgender athletes in girls' and women's sports",
    "News_text":"Washington —The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will consider whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports, setting up a high-profile clash that could have far-reaching implications across the country.\n\nThe justices agreed to decide whether laws from Idaho and West Virginia that prevent transgender girls and women from competing in female athletics violate the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. The cases involving transgender rights come after the court's conservative majorityupheld a banon gender-affirming care for transgender minors last month.\n\nBeginning in its next term in October, the Supreme Court will review lower court decisions in favor of transgender athletes from Idaho and West Virginia who challenged the bans in their respective states. The Idaho case involves the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, while the dispute over West Virginia's law involves the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.\n\nThe issue of transgender athletes participating in girls' and women's sports has exploded at the state level in recent years. Idaho was the first state to pass a law prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in women and girls' sports, and two dozen have since followed suit. Roughly half of the states have also passed laws that bar certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.\n\nAt the federal level, President Trumpsigned an executive orderin February that aimed to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The president's order directs that under Title IX, educational institutions that receive federal funds cannot \"deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.\"\n\nOn the heels of Mr. Trump's executive order, the NCAA announced it hadupdated its participation policyfor transgender athletes to bar student-athletes who were assigned male at birth from competing on women's teams. On Wednesday, the University of Pennsylvaniasaid it would no longer allow transgender athletesto participate in women's sports as part of an agreement to resolve Title IX violations. The Trump administration had opened an investigation into the school after it awarded Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer, a spot on the women's swimming team.\n\n\"Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth,\" said Joshua Block of the ACLU, which is representing the athletes in the cases, Lindsay Hecox and Becky Pepper-Jackson. \"We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.\"\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey said he is confident the Supreme Court will uphold his state's law.\n\n\"It's a great day, as female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \"The people of West Virginia know that it's unfair to let male athletes compete against women; that's why we passed this commonsense law preserving women's sports for women.\"\n\nIdaho's law\n\nIdaho's measure, called the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, requires athletic teams or sports to be designated based on biological sex, and says those for women or girls \"shall not be open to students of the male sex.\" If there is any dispute about a student's sex, the law says schools must ask for a health examination and consent form verifying the student's biological sex.\n\nAfter Idaho's GOP-led legislature passed the legislation, Hecox, a transgender woman who was attending Boise State University, sued, arguing the law violates Title IX and the Constitution's promise of equal protection under the law. Hecox was a freshman when she filed her lawsuit in April 2020, and she said she wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore, but couldn't do so because of Idaho's ban.\n\nHecox has received treatment for gender dysphoria since 2019, including testosterone suppression and estrogen, according to court papers.\n\nA federal district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding that Hecox was likely to succeed in her challenge. U.S. District Judge David Nyewrotein August 2020 that the ban \"on its face discriminates between cisgender athletes, who may compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity, and transgender women athletes, who may not compete on athletic teams consistent with their gender identity.\"\n\nAdditionally, Nye found the measure discriminates against transgender women by categorically excluding them from female sports and subjects participants in female athletics to a \"potentially invasive\" process for verifying a student's biological sex.\n\nAs a result of the district court's order, Hecox tried out for the women's NCAA running teams at Boise State, but did not qualify. She instead participated in women's club soccer and running at the university, according to court filings.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuitupheldthe district court's injunction as applied to Hecox, finding that Idaho's ban targets all transgender girls and women regardless of their testosterone levels or whether they have received certain gender-transition treatments.\n\nThe appeals court said that the record in the case doesn't back \"the conclusion that all transgender women, including those like Lindsay who receive hormone therapy, have a physiological advantage over cisgender women.\"\n\nThe West Virginia law\n\nWest Virginia's legislature passed its law, the Save Women's Sports Act, in 2021, which restricts participation on girls' sports teams based on biological sex, defined as a student's \"reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" The law prohibits transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports at every level, including club and intramural activities.\n\nState officials have argued the law aims to protect equality in girls' sports, and it does not prevent anyone from trying out for men's, boys' or co-ed teams.\n\n\"It is only when students are playing skill and contact sports — where biological sex has a direct effect—  that biological males (again, however they might identify) cannot compete with females,\" they wrote in a Supreme Courtfiling.\n\nBefore the law took effect, Pepper-Jackson, who was then 11 years old, challenged the measure, arguing it is unconstitutional and violates Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools or programs that receive federal funding.\n\nPepper-Jackson, now a teenager, was born male but began identifying as female at \"an early age,\" lawyers wrote in court papers. She has received puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy.  When Pepper-Jackson was a rising sixth grader and preparing to begin middle school, she was informed by her school's principal that she could not participate in girls' school sports because of West Virginia's law.\n\nA federal judge in July 2022 temporarily blocked West Virginia from enforcing the law only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling its application would likely violate Title IX and the Constitution. As a result of the injunction, she was able to participate in her middle school girls' cross-country and track-and-field teams.\n\nIn early 2023, U.S. District judge Joseph Goodwin ruled for the state and upheld the law. He also lifted the earlier injunction that had blocked enforcement against Pepper-Jackson.\n\n\"A transgender girl is biologically male and, barring medical intervention, would undergo male puberty like other biological males. And biological males generally outperform females athletically,\" he wrote. \"The state is permitted to legislate sports rules on this basis because sex, and the physical characteristics that flow from it, are substantially related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.\"\n\nPepper-Jackson appealed and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit for emergency relief, which would've allowed her to participate in the spring 2023 track-and-field season. The appeals court granted her request, after which West Virginia officials sought the Supreme Court's intervention. The high court thendenied the state's bidto allow it to enforce the law against Pepper-Jackson, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissenting.\n\nA divided 4th Circuit issued arulingon the merits of the case in April 2024, finding West Virginia's law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.\n\nCiting Pepper-Jackson's years-long identity as a girl, social transition, name change, updated birth certificate listing her as a female and medical treatments, the 4th Circuit's majority said offering her a \"'choice' between not participating in sports and participating only on boys teams is no real choice at all.\"\n\n\"By participating on boys teams, B.P.J. would be sharing the field with boys who are larger, stronger, and faster than her because of the elevated levels of circulating testosterone she lacks,\" Judge Toby Heytens wrote. \"The act thus exposes B.P.J. to the very harms Title IX is meant to prevent by effectively 'exclud[ing]' her from 'participation in' all non-coed sports entirely.\"\n\nBut in their appeal to the Supreme Court, West Virginia officials argued that the 4th Circuit's decision threatens Title IX's promise of equal athletic opportunity for women and girls.\n\n\"In the Fourth Circuit, females must now compete against biological males — and all the physiological advantages they possess — in all athletic events,\" lawyers for the state wrote.\n\nLawyers for Pepper-Jackson argued it's too soon for the Supreme Court to weigh in, as the 4th Circuit's decision is the first and only from a federal appeals court to address Title IX's protections for transgender athletes.\n\nSocial media content creator shows his hustle\n\nUdemy Is Powering Enterprise AI Transformation Through Skills\n\nNew documentary explores how shooter accessed Trump Butler event for assassination attempt",

Laurie Sanko, Leah’s mother, disagrees with the OSBI report and maintains her daughter could not have hurt herself, including breaking her own ribs. The Sanko family said Leah is residing in a shelter and needs mental health treatment.\n\nLaurie Sanko said her daughter’s brain bleed caused permanent paralysis on her left side. She said her daughter’s hand doesn’t work, and her mind thinks her parents are her enemies, she said.\n\n“She’s being rude towards us now and thinks we had someone do this, but her mental status already was bipolar, now she’s accusing us of having her hurt,” said Laurie Sanko. “She cannot even get along with us right now; she doesn’t remember us not leaving her side for three months.”\n\nOfficers with the Miami Police Department responded to a 911 call for a possible medical overdose in January when they transported Sanko to Miami Integris Hospital.

    "News_title":"Altadena residents are reluctant to sue L.A. County over botched evacuations during Eaton fire. Here's why",
    "News_text":"For many residents of west Altadena, it's hard to shake the feeling that they were victimized twice by the January firestorm that swept into their neighborhood.\n\nNot only were massive swaths of the area destroyed in the blaze, but hundreds were forced to flee in dangerous conditions because evacuation alerts came hours after smoke and flames threatened their community. Many believe the delayed alerts in west Altadena were a key reason all but one of the Eaton fire's 18 deaths were there.\n\nRevelations about the delay,made by The Times in January, sparked outrage toward Los Angeles County officials, who were tasked with issuing evacuation alerts, and prompted an ongoing independent investigation into what went wrong.\n\nDespite continued community anger and frustration, no one has yet filed suit against the county for the lapse.\n\nAlmost a dozen residents told The Times that they were, at one point, considering a legal case against the county over its delayed evacuation alerts, but as the six-month deadline to file such a claim rapidly approached, more and more people abandoned the idea.\n\nSeveral decided after talking to lawyers that they couldn't risk jeopardizing any settlement with Southern California Edison, which hundreds of residents already have sued, alleging the utility started the fire and should be held liable — potentially to thetune of $24 billion to $45 billion.\n\nOthers worried that legal hurdles could make a court battle unwinnable. Many, such as Heather Morrow, simply realized they didn't have the time or wherewithal to keep going, as much as they supported the effort.\n\nMorrow was planning on filing a legal claim against the county — in the hopes that an attorney might eventually take up the cause — but after a few weeks of consideration, she decided she couldn't devote that much time to another exhausting effort, on top of the complicated rebuilding process and an art show she's putting on that honors Altadena's humanity.\n\n“I would still like answers,\" Morrow, 55, said. \"I just decided that it’s not an effort that I have time to do. ... I just decided I’d switch my energy more to a positive thing.\"\n\nThe decision has left some in an unsettling state of limbo. They fear they can't rebuild or move forward without transparency and assurances that mistakes won't be repeated. Others simply want answers from Los Angeles County officials about why or how their section of town was left behind, so they can process their trauma or prepare for the future.\n\nCounty officials confirmed this week that no lawsuits have been filed against the county in relation to the Eaton fire. It wasn't immediately clear whether any claims — a precursor to a lawsuit — had been filed.\n\nMorrow said she does worry that residents may never understand what went wrong the night of the Eaton fire without pressure from a legal case.\n\n“I don't know that there will be an answer,\" Morrow said. “Hopefully they’ll get there, hopefully they’ll figure out that they need to tell the community what happened. ... If the truth doesn’t come out, there’s no lesson to be learned.\"\n\nLos Angeles County officials have repeatedly declined to share information or answer questions about what happened with the delayed evacuation alerts in west Altadena on Jan. 7 and 8, citing an ongoing, independent investigation into the fire's evacuation process by disaster management firmMcChrystal Group.\n\nIn a statement this week, the county's Coordinated Joint Information Center said residents \"deserve an answer to what happened with evacuations in West Altadena.\" However, the statement said county officials had no timeline for when that would come. Officials said they would not speculate on what the independent investigation would find, or what might be included in McChrystal Group's next update, which is scheduled for late July.\n\nThe company's last report simply shared the status of the investigation, without any substantive information. McChrystal Group did not respond to questions from The Times about its next report.\n\nRead more:Signs of human error grow in failure to evacuate Altadena during fire. But who is to blame?\n\nAn electronic evacuation order was not issued for residents west of North Lake Avenue, the town's east-west divider, until about 3:30 a.m. Jan. 8, nearly nine hours after the Eaton fire broke out andseveral hours after smoke and flames began to threatenthe area. Some neighborhoods in southwest Altadena weren’t ordered to evacuateuntil almost 6 a.m.People east of North Lake, closer to the fire’s origin, received their first evacuation alert about 6:40 p.m. Jan. 7, according toa review by The Times.\n\nThe disparity was particularly concerning because west Altadena was known as anenclave for Black homeownership, and remains home to a much more diverse population compared with neighborhoods east of North Lake.\n\nTo many, it felt like an obvious case for a lawsuit. Not only did their electronic evacuation alerts come hours after the area became unsafe, but many residents reported seeing no emergency personnel in the area at the time they ended up evacuating.\n\n“I didn’t hear any fire engines,\" Morrow said. \"They could have gone through the streets doing a megaphone to evacuate. If the system’s failing, there’s other ways to notify people. ... I don't understand why there was no notice.\"\n\nBut as the coalition of west Altadena residents looked further into pursuing a lawsuit against their local government, the more challenging it seemed.\n\nNo attorney agreed to take on their plight, and several lawyers advised residents that such a case could potentially fracture payouts from Edison, if the utility tries to deflect liability to the county.\n\nExperts said suing a government entity is much more challenging than suing a private company. There also appears to be no precedent in California for a case successfully proving liability related to delayed or failed evacuation alerts.\n\nRead more:911 logs show more than a dozen calls from burning west Altadena before evacuations ordered\n\nBut the most glaring hurdle would be getting around the broad immunity that government bodies in California have from failing to provide fire protection or evacuation alerts, said Neama Rahmani, president of the L.A.-based West Coast Trial Lawyers law firm, which is handling Eaton fire cases against Edison.\n\n“Failing to provide fire protection or insufficient fire protection or firefighting services — they are absolutely immune from liability on that basis,\" Rahmani said. \"These cases are very, very, very difficult.\"\n\nRahmani said any attorney who agreed to take such a case would be giving residents \"false hope,\" as he expects most judges would dismiss such a case.\n\nIt also would be hard to attribute harm or damages specifically from the county's failure for evacuation alerts, said David Levine, a professor of law at UC San Francisco.\n\n\"It's going to be really hard to separate out the category of damage that you could lay at the feet of the L.A. County officials,” Levine said.\n\nGiven all the challenges of such a case, Rahmani and Levine said they thought the circumstances were better suited for the public sphere, actions such as contacting elected officials and lobbying the county's Board of Supervisors.\n\n“The remedies are in the political realm, not the legal realm,\" Levine said. “That's probably a far better route if you're really looking for prevention in the future, accountability — far better than litigation, because in this instance there's just so many hurdles.\"\n\nRead more:Altadena suffered a ‘catastrophic failure.’ Did unincorporated status hurt fire response?\n\nThe county has said it is committed to learning from what happened in Altadena.\n\n\"We will also spare no effort in addressing any findings found [through] the multiple after-action reviews that the county is currently engaged in and cooperating with,\" it said in a statement. \"These processes are deliberative, thorough, and intended to bring substantive change to how we serve our residents.\"\n\nBut many residents question whether the McChrystal report will shine a light on what exactly went wrong or whether county officials will ever accept full responsibility for their mistakes.\n\nOne woman who was determined to file a claim against the county over the failed evacuation alerts decided at the last minute that she didn't want to risk compromising her case against Edison after a lengthy discussion with her attorney.\n\nThe woman, who requested anonymity for fear she could be subpoenaed in a future lawsuit, said she wanted to hold government accountable. In the end though, she said she faced an impossible choice: “Do you want accountability, or do you want money? ... Do you want to be made financially whole? Or do you want to live in a county that has learned from its mistakes and acknowledged its role in harming you?”\n\nMark Douglas was among the first people calling out the county's missteps during the evacuation, starting an Instagram page with his partner calledAltadena West of Lake, where they continue to advocate for accountability and call on the county and local leaders to better protect and respond to the needs of Altadena.

    "News_title":"Supreme Court takes up transgender school athlete bans",
    "News_text":"The Supreme Court agreed Thursday to decide whether states can ban transgender athletes from competing on girls and women’s school sports teams.\n\nThe justices said they would hear appeals from Republican leaders in Idaho and West Virginia defending their state bans. A decision is expected by next summer.\n\nThe move sets up another major dispute over transgender rights before the conservative-majority court that recentlyupheld Tennessee’s banon gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nIn the wake of that decision, the justices Monday sent back to lower courts disputes involving Idaho’s Medicaid prohibition on transition-related surgeries, North Carolina’s similar ban in its state-sponsored health plan and Oklahoma’s refusal to change the listed sex on transgender people’s birth certificates.\n\nBut the Supreme Court held onto the transgender athlete cases that had piled up on their docket, weighing requests from Idaho and West Virginia’s Republican attorneys general to get involved now.\n\n“It’s a great day, as female athletes in West Virginia will have their voices heard,” West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey (R) said Thursday.\n\n“We are confident the Supreme Court will uphold the Save Women’s Sports Act because it complies with the U.S. Constitution and complies with Title IX. And most importantly: it protects women and girls by ensuring the playing field is safe and fair,” he added.\n\nThe justices’ decision next term stands to impact a wave of laws restricting transgender athletes’ participation in 27 states. In 2020, Idaho became the first state in the nation to ban trans students from competing on teams that match their gender identity.\n\nIn February, President Trump signedan executive orderopposing transgender women and girls’ participation in female sports.\n\n“Female athletes are losing medals, podium spots, public recognition, and opportunities to compete due to males who insist on participating in women’s sports,” Idaho wrote in its petition. “So much of what women and girls have achieved for themselves over the course of several decades is being stolen from them—all under the guise of ‘equality.’”\n\nThe laws have sparked an array of legal challenges that argue they violate the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and Title IX, the federal law against sex discrimination in schools.\n\nMany of the challenges are spearheaded by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represents the plaintiffs in both Idaho and West Virginia.\n\n“Like any other educational program, school athletic programs should be accessible for everyone regardless of their sex or transgender status. Trans kids play sports for the same reasons their peers do — to learn perseverance, dedication, teamwork, and to simply have fun with their friends,” said Joshua Block, senior counsel for the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project. “Categorically excluding kids from school sports just because they are transgender will only make our schools less safe and more hurtful places for all youth. We believe the lower courts were right to block these discriminatory laws, and we will continue to defend the freedom of all kids to play.”\n\nIn Idaho, the civil rights group represents Lindsay Hecox, a transgender runner who wanted to compete on Boise State University’s women’s track and cross-country teams. Lower court rulings allowed Hecox to try out for the teams, leading to Idaho’s latest appeal.\n\n“Petitioners seek to create a false sense of national emergency when nothing of the sort is presented by this case. This case is about a four-year old injunction against the application of H.B. 500 with respect to one woman, which is allowing her to participate in club running and club soccer in her final year of college,” Hecox’s legal team wrote in court filings last year.\n\nThe ACLU similarly urged the court to turn away the appeal in West Virginia, where a lower court blocked the state from enforcing its ban against Becky Pepper-Jackson, a high school student who throws discus and shot put for her school’s girls track-and-field team.\n\nWhen Pepper-Jackson first sued the state over its restrictions on transgender athletes, she was 11 years old and in middle school.\n\nBoth Idaho and West Virginia’s attorneys general brought on Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal powerhouse, to defend their bans.\n\nUpdated at 9:54 a.m. EDT\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"First immigration detainees arrive at Florida center in the Everglades",
    "News_text":"The first group ofimmigrantshas arrived ata new detention centerdeep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” a spokesperson for Republican state Attorney General James Uthmeier told The Associated Press.\n\n“People are there,” Press Secretary Jae Williams said, though he didn't immediately provide further details on the number of detainees or when they arrived.\n\n“Next stop: back to where they came from,” Uthmeier said on the X social media platform Wednesday. He’s been credited as the architect behind the Everglades proposal.\n\n“Stood up in record time under@GovRonDeSantis’ leadership & in coordination with@DHSgov&@ICEgov, Florida is proud to help facilitate@realDonaldTrump’s mission to enforce immigration law,” the account for the Florida Division of Emergency Management posted to the social media site X on Thursday. Requests for additional information from the office of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and FDEM, which is building the site, were not returned early Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe facility,at an airport used for training, will have an initial capacity of about 3,000 detainees, DeSantis said. The center was built in eight days and features more than 200 security cameras, 28,000-plus feet (8,500 meters) of barbed wire and 400 security personnel.\n\nImmigrants who are arrested by Florida law enforcement officers under the federal government’s 287(g) program will be taken to the facility, according to an official inPresident Donald Trump's administration. The program is led byImmigration and Customs Enforcementand allows police officers to interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them forpotential deportation.\n\nThe facility is expected to be expanded in 500 bed increments until it has an estimated 5,000 beds by early July.\n\nA group of Florida Democratic state lawmakers headed to the facility Thursday to conduct “an official legislative site visit,” citing concerns about conditions for detainees and the awarding of millions of dollars in state contracts for the construction.\n\n“As lawmakers, we have both the legal right and moral responsibility to inspect this site, demand answers, and expose this abuse before it becomes the national blueprint,” the legislators said in a joint statement ahead of the visit.\n\nFederal agencies signaled their opposition Thursday to a lawsuit brought by environmental groups seeking to halt operations at the detention center. Though Trump applauded the center during an official tour earlier this week, the filing on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security seemed to try to distance his administration from the facility, and said no federal money to date has been spent on it.\n\n“DHS has not implemented, authorized, directed, or funded Florida’s temporary detention center. Florida is constructing and operating the facility using state funds on state lands under state emergency authority and a preexisting general delegation of federal authority to implement immigration functions,” the U.S. filing says.\n\nHuman rights advocates and Native American tribes have alsoprotested against the center,contending it is a threat to the fragile Everglades system, would be cruel to detainees because of heat and mosquitoes, and is on land the tribes consider sacred.\n\nIt’s also located at a place prone to frequent heavy rains, which caused some flooding in the tents Tuesday during a visit by President Donald Trump to mark its opening. State officials say the complex can withstand a Category 2 hurricane, which packs winds of between 96 and 110 mph (154 and 177 kph), and that contractors worked overnight to shore up areas where flooding occurred.\n\nAccording to images shared with the AP, overnight Wednesday, workers put up new signs labeled “Alligator Alcatraz” along the sole highway leading to the site and outside the entrance of the airfield that has been known as the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. State officials seized the county-owned land where the facility is located using emergency powers authorized by an executive order issued by the governor.\n\nDeSantis and other state officials say locating the facility in the rugged and remote Florida Everglades is meant as a deterrent — and naming it after thenotorious federal prisonof Alcatraz, an island fortress known for its brutal conditions, is meant to send a message. It’s another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying onscare tacticsto try to persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.\n\nState and federal officials have touted the plans on social media and conservative airwaves, sharing a meme of a compound ringed with barbed wire and “guarded” by alligators wearing hats labeled “ICE” for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Republican Party of Florida has taken to fundraising off the detention center, selling branded T-shirts and beer koozies emblazoned with the facility’s name.\n\n_____\n\nAnderson reported from St. Petersburg, Florida.

    "News_title":"Extreme heat is becoming more common in the U.S. Here’s how to stay safe.",
    "News_text":"Summer brings heat waves — and the risk of heat-related illnesses.\n\nExtreme heat is theprimary causeof weather-related mortality in the United States, posing a significant threat to public health. Periods of unusually hot weather are especially dangerous for elderly people and those with chronic conditions. But anyone working or exercising outside, or those without access to cool shelters, can be vulnerable to health effects during heat waves.\n\nAnd it’s only getting hotter. With climate change, extreme heat events are expected to becomemore frequent and intense. Globally, nearly half of the world’s population experienced at least 30 extra days of extreme heat between May 2024 and May 2025, a result of human-driven climate change, according to anew reportfrom scientists at Climate Central, Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and World Weather Attribution.\n\nHealthbeatshares what to know about extreme heat and how to stay safe this summer.\n\nExtreme heat is generally considered to be a prolonged period of hot, and sometimes humid, weather that is unusual for a certain location and time of year.\n\nBut there is no standard nationwide definition of extreme heat across the United States, given the country’s highly varied climates, said Dr. Jaime Madrigano, an associate professor of American health in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n“We have a big country, and it’s not uniform,” she said.\n\nAs a result, there are varying thresholds for heat advisories, as well as differences in how heat-related mortality is recorded, she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than700 people diefrom extreme heat every year across the country. But the full scope of mortality is likely much higher, because heat-related deaths can occur even without temperatures reaching extreme levels. A JAMAstudypublished last year recorded 2,325 heat-related deaths in the United States in 2023, the highest annual total — and a 117% increase — since 1999.\n\nIn New York City alone, an estimated 580 people, on average, die prematurely each summer due to hot weather, typically when heat aggravates underlying illness, according tocity data. The city’s 2024 Heat-Related Mortality Report noted that heat-exacerbated deaths have increased over the past decade because of summers that are hotter overall, with more “non-extreme hot days” of temperatures between 82°F and the city’s extreme heat threshold of 95°F.\n\nExtreme heat can have a wide range of effects on our bodies. Heat cramps — muscle cramps and spasms that occur after intense exercise and sweating in high heat — can be the first sign of heat-related illness.Heat exhaustion, which occurs when the body loses water and salt, is characterized by dizziness, thirst, heavy sweating, nausea, and weakness, and can lead to heatstroke.\n\nThe most common heat-related illnesses that Dr. Christopher Tedeschi, an associate professor of emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, sees in the summer are respiratory or cardiac illnesses exacerbated by intense heat.\n\n“It doesn’t need to be in the middle of a heat wave,” he said. “Someone with asthma or emphysema, in the setting of a day where the heat index is high, certainly is more at risk of having an exacerbation of their chronic illness.”\n\nHeatstroke is more rare, but requires an emergency response, he said. That condition occurs when a person’s body temperature rises rapidly — to106°F or higher within 10 to 15 minutes— and cannot cool down. Symptoms of heatstroke include confusion and slurred speech, loss of consciousness, hot skin, seizures, and very high body temperature. Heatstroke can lead to permanent disability or death.\n\nThe condition can occur in older people who can’t easily cool their bodies down, Tedeschi said, but also in younger people who exert themselves on hot days, like an athlete who collapses during preseason training. In those cases, ER teams will work to quickly cool people down, including by immersing them in ice water.\n\n“When people have heatstroke, cooling them quickly is really the key to reducing their mortality,” he said.\n\nPeople who are particularly vulnerable to heat-related illness include those with asthma or heart disease, pregnant women, those 65 years or older, infants, young children, those working or exercising outside, and those who are unhoused,according to the CDC.\n\nSocioeconomic status and access to green spaces can significantly shape one’s vulnerability to extreme heat, and some cities have made efforts to map out areas where those factors are particularly pronounced.New York City’s heat vulnerability index details whichneighborhoods are most at riskfor death during and after extreme heat, based on factors like daytime summer surface temperature, access to air conditioning, median income, and the availability of green space.Philadelphiaoffers a similar tool that identifies heat vulnerability on a block-by-block basis, as well as identifying local pools, libraries, parks, and health centers.\n\nMadrigano, the Johns Hopkins expert, is researching heat vulnerability in New Orleans. The city’s hot, humid weather and high poverty rate make it particularly susceptible to heat-related morbidity and mortality, she said, pointing to factors like whether residents can afford to keep their air conditioning running.\n\n“From a public health perspective, we know the most effective strategy for keeping people safe during extreme heat is air conditioning,” she said.\n\nIn some states, new tools aim to help residents and officials identify who is most at risk during heat waves. In California, the newly releasedCalHeatScoreoffers daily rankings of forecast heat impacts in ZIP codes across the state. New York state recentlylaunched a similar tool, which combines weather forecasting with data on heat-related emergency department visits and emergency medical services calls.\n\nThere are ways to mitigate health impacts during periods of hot weather.\n\n“At the end of the day, it’s about protecting yourself from heat, taking frequent breaks, staying hydrated, staying in cool areas if you can, adjusting your work hours, if you can, to avoid those hottest parts of the day,” Tedeschi said.\n\nWhen venturing outside, wear loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing and sunscreen, and try to stay in the shade if possible, the CDC advises. During periods of elevated temperatures, never leave children or pets in cars.\n\nOther standard recommendations include staying in air-conditioned indoor locations. People who lack air conditioning at home are advised to seek out cool public spaces like libraries. The National Center for Healthy Housing offers a list of each state’scooling center resources.\n\nSome states and cities have rolled out heat response and climate mitigation plans, ranging from heat and health forecasts to initiatives topaint reflective roofs and plant more trees. But a federal effort to develop heat mitigation strategies across the country was recentlydefundedby the Trump administration.\n\nMeanwhile, cities continue to heat up.In Atlanta, compared to 1970, there are now almost two more weeks of extreme heat per year. And New York City is projected to see the number of days each year with temperatures higher than 90 degrees rise from 17 to as many as 54 by the 2030s — and as many as 108 by the 2080s.\n\nThe warming climate also poses challenges for health systems. In a 2022NEJM Catalystarticle, researchers noted that New York City can expect the number of heat waves to increase from an average of two per year to seven per year by 2050, and urged hospital systems to create response plans.\n\nTedeschi, the New York City emergency room physician, worries about what increasingly long and intense heat waves will mean for the patients he cares for — and health systems. A heat wave can become a “mass casualty event” if multiple patients arrive with heatstroke, which requires a robust team response, he said.\n\n“I expect we’ll see more patients in the ER with heat-exacerbated illness over the next few years,” he said.\n\nThis storywas produced byHealthbeatand reviewed and distributed byStacker.",

Afghans brought to the United States after the war, many having helped U.S. armed forces, are now among the immigrants with legal status facing a possible loss of public benefits under the Senate tax and spending package passed Tuesday. (Photo by Jon Cherry\/Getty Images)\n\nProvisions in the new tax and spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate early Tuesday would go even further than the House bill in removing health care and other benefits from immigrants with legal status.\n\nTheHouse versionof the massive tax and spending bill penalized states providing health care for some immigrants with legal status as well as those that chose to spend state money to enroll immigrants without legal status in Medicaid.\n\nBut the Senate bill is even tougher on immigrants here legally and illegally, reducing benefits for most refugees and immigrants on humanitarian parole, including Afghans and Ukrainians who helped the United States in wars overseas and in return were promised safe haven and a safety net in the United States.\n\nThe Senate bill also cuts state reimbursement for emergency care in the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. That would force those states to pay more for emergency care for immigrants, cut back services or drop out of Medicaid expansion, a potentially catastrophic move for low-income U.S. citizens as well as new immigrants.\n\nThe bill passed with three dissenting Republican votes, from U.S. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The bill, officially the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” now returns to the House for final passage before going to President Donald Trump to be signed.\n\nAdvocates and experts see repercussions as refugees and other legal immigrants lose health insurance and turn to already-stressed hospitals and charities for help. It could be a nail in the coffin for somerural hospitalsthat are in financial trouble and scaling back services. Hospitals are required to serve anyone who arrives for emergency care, regardless of their ability to pay.\n\n“In our state, it’s going to be absolutely devastating for rural hospitals,” said Kate Woomer-Deters, a senior attorney at the North Carolina Justice Center’s Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Refugees are not going to go home just because they lost their health care coverage. They’re still going to be showing up at the door of hospitals and clinics needing care.”\n\nSome groups, such as Afghans, Ukrainians and Iraqis, were often brought here after helping the U.S. in war efforts, putting their lives in danger and making life in their home country untenable.\n\n“In the case of the Afghans, this is pretty much a knife in the back to those folks who helped the United States when the United States needed help in their country,” said David Meyer, a board member of the Bloomington Refugee Support Network in Indiana, where he personally helps seven refugee families from Afghanistan, Honduras, Iraq, Nicaragua and Syria.\n\nThe Senate bill takes Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and even food stamps off the table for most refugees. There are a few narrow exceptions for people with green cards, some Cuban migrants waiting for citizenship, and some Micronesians and Marshall Islands natives with treaty rights, said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nThat also applies to immigrants with legal status who don’t have green cards: people with asylum, immigrant victims of domestic violence, immigrant victims of sex trafficking and parolees — such as Afghans — admitted due to urgent humanitarian reasons, as well as to refugees.\n\n“There’s going to be more emergency health care needs because uninsured people will be delaying care,” Gonzales said. “It’s not going to help hospitals. It’s not going to help individuals. It’s not going to help states. There’s going to be some cost-eating by all of them.”\n\nThe bill also cuts funding for expansion states to pay for emergency care in hospitals. Increased costs could force some states to drop Medicaid expansion altogether, spreading the pain to low-income U.S. citizens as well, Gonzales said.\n\n“It’s one more reason states are looking at their budgets and they’re having to make decisions about their Medicaid expansion program,” Gonzales said.\n\nIn Indiana, Meyer said, Afghan women especially often need food stamps, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to get by at first. It takes them a long time to learn to read and write since they were not allowed to attend any school under the Taliban.\n\n“They arrived in our community totally illiterate in their native language and starting from scratch learning English, so that’s a huge impediment to being gainfully employed,” Meyer said. Even once they’ve become self-sufficient enough to get off food stamps and Medicaid, many still need the support of the Affordable Care Act to get health care.\n\nRemoving all subsidized health care “would have a devastating effect on those families, and not just Afghans but Syrians, people from the Democratic Republic of Congo and others that have been relocated to south-central Indiana,” Meyer said.\n\nIndiana hosted more than 10,500 of the nearly 460,000 refugees who arrived in the United States between 2013 and 2023, accordingto a 2023 reportfrom the nonprofit Immigration Research Initiative. In fiscal 2024, another 1,380 arrived in Indiana, mostly from Congo and Burma, but including 90 people from Afghanistan, according toState Department records.\n\nIn North Carolina, there were 276 new Afghan refugees in fiscal 2024 among 2,730 total new refugees. Even professional Afghans such as doctors and lawyers struggle at first in low-wage jobs, said Woomer-Deters, of the North Carolina Justice Center. It takes time for them to get accreditation and language skills to practice their professions here, she said.\n\n“A lot of these folks need their food stamps, Medicaid — they need these programs for an adjustment period when they get here. And these are people we’ve invited to come and have vetted,” she said.\n\nA Congressional Budget Officereport June 29estimated that almost 12 million people, including 1.4 million immigrants covered by state-only programs, would lose health insurance under the Senate plan.\n\nARepublican responseto an earlier CBO report emphasized that the bill would save states $13.1 billion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, “freeing up resources they can choose to reinvest to further strengthen care for the most vulnerable Americans.”\n\nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, however, called that conclusion misleading in its ownresponse in turn.\n\n“These savings would largely result from millions of people losing health coverage — hardly an outcome worth celebrating,” the response said.\n\nLeonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families, said there was one small positive change in the Senate version compared to the House version.\n\nStates will no longer be penalized for using the option to cover some immigrant children and pregnant women.\n\nAnd the Senate version would not penalize expansion states for offering Medicaid to immigrants on humanitarian parole, but only because that help for parolees was ended in entirely, along with help for refugees and other kind of immigrants with legal status who lack green cards, Cuello said.\n\n“In other words, they are blocking all paths to health care,” Cuello said in an emailed statement. “This is not an attack on the undocumented.

    "News_title":"Director of Opportunity House retires after more than 30 years",
    "News_text":"Modesto Fiume remembers the first time he visited Opportunity House.\n\nIt was 1994, and he was there for an interview for the position of director.\n\nThe organization was then little more than an emergency shelter in a converted warehouse, he noted.\n\nFiume doesn’t remember much about what was said, but something must have convinced the board he was the one to grow and build the nonprofit.\n\nThey were not mistaken.\n\nFiume, 67, of Bethlehem Township, Northampton County, retired Monday after more than 30 years as director\/CEO of the nonprofit.\n\nDuring his tenure, he oversaw the transformation of Opportunity House from a basic overnight shelter for men into a comprehensive community support organization, offering an array of services benefitting men, women and children in need.\n\nThe organization started by Reading Urban Ministries in 1984 had recently moved to its current building at 430 N. Second St. when Fiume took the helm.\n\n“It was a battery warehouse that had been converted to a people warehouse,” Kevin K. Murphy, president and CEO of Berks County Community Foundation, said, describing the state of the facility when Fiume took charge.\n\nModesto Fiume stands the pantry of what was then Reading Emergency Shelter in 1994. Fiume, who oversaw the transformation to Opportunity House and growth in services led the organization more than 30 years. (Courtesy of Opportunity House)\n\nMurphy was among those who spoke during a recent event celebrating Fiume’s accomplishments and retirement.\n\nFiume’s transformative leadership, Murphy said, was characterized by visionary thinking, strategic planning and commitment to the dignity of every person who walked through Opportunity House’s doors.\n\nDr. R. Keith Hillkirk, chancellor emeritus of Penn State Berks, was an early supporter and significant funder of the organization. He worked closely with Fiume through much of the expansion.\n\nHillkirk praised Fiume’s creative and intrepid approach to tackling challenges, even in the face of opponents, as instrumental to the organization’s success.\n\n“I think Modesto is the consummate enemy of chaos,” he said. “I have watched the courage and the resilience and the strength, and frankly, sometimes, the bullheadedness that he brings to these challenges.”\n\nHillkirk recalled how some on the shelter’s board of directors were skeptical of Fiume’s initiatives, including the start of the Second Street Learning Center with the help of United Way of Berks County in 1996, partnering with Berks County in 2004 to operate the Children’s Alliance Center and opening the retail thrift store Opp Shop in Muhlenberg Township in 2015.\n\nModesto Fiume, shown outside outside the Linkages permanent housing at Opportunity House in 2022, has retired as nonprofit’s president and CEO. (BILL UHRICH – READING EAGLE)\n\nTammy White, president of the local United Way said the center was particularly visionary as it was established during a time when child care options in Berks County were extremely limited.\n\nIt has become an integral part of the organization’s holistic approach to supporting families, she said, and complements other services, such as transitional housing, job training and education support.\n\nThe high quality of the learning center is so impressive, she said, that it became a model for other communities and will be replicated by Opportunity House in the Reading Housing Authority’s soon-to-be-opened Neighborhood Resource Center at Oakbrook Homes.\n\nFiume said the learning center, which in 2001 became the first in the state to offer 24\/7 child care, and other initiatives implemented under his watch were primarily needs-driven.\n\n“What prompted all this, really, always came from the people in the shelter,” he said. “Their needs were identified.”\n\nClients with children needed child care services so they could work, meet with case managers and rebuild their lives, he said.\n\nThis pattern of identifying needs and developing responsive programs became the foundation of Opportunity House’s approach to service delivery, he said.\n\nMurphy also praised Fiume’s careful planning for succession, which positioned the organization to continue thriving after his retirement. Alyssa Bushkie, formerly COO of the organization, stepped in as CEO and director.\n\nAlyssa Bushkie, formerly COO of Opportunity House, stepped in as CEO and director following the retirement of Modesto Fiume. (COURTESY OF OPPORTUNITY HOUSE)\n\n“I was able to surround myself with a great team the past couple years,” Fiume said, praising Bushkie and others, “and it really has helped.”\n\nDuring his years of service, Fiume was not only dedicated to the welfare of the greater Reading community and clients of Opportunity House, said his son, Jeremy Fiume. He was also dedicated to his family and home community.\n\n“He was the coach of pretty much all of my baseball teams as I was growing up,” said Jeremy, who manages the Opp Shop.\n\nThe elder Fiume also coached other sports and served as president of the Bethlehem Township Athletic Association and on the boards of other sports clubs, his son said.\n\nWhile Fiume said he is looking forward to less-pressured days, he has no plans to idle away his retirement. He intends to spend more time at home and traveling with his wife, Susan, he said, and will keep physically fit through his longtime hobbies of running and biking.\n\nHe also hopes to volunteer for Opportunity House and will join Susan as a volunteer at the Opp Shop.",

Reader discretion is advised; please proceed with caution.\n\nDavid Lacks, 19, was indicted on Thursday for theviolent attackand rape of a 15-year-old girl in Tel Aviv.\n\nThe two met through theTikTokapp on June 16, three days after the strikes on Iran sent the country into emergency mode.\n\nThe girl lied about her age, saying she was 17. They met that Monday and spent the day in Rosh Ha’ayin together.\n\nThe next day, on June 17 at around 3 p.m., Lacks picked her up in his car from her house, driving towardsHayarkon Parkin Tel Aviv. On the way, he told her he had alcoholic beverages in his bag. He drank a full cup of Arak, while she drank some Arak mixed with lemonade.\n\nWhen they arrived at the park, they sat on the grass and began to kiss. During the kiss, he bit her upper lip hard, making it swell.\n\nHe then poured a full cup of Arak down her throat. She got dizzy and laid down on the grass to steady herself, but he laid on top of her, on her stomach, and bit her face, close to her right eye, and on her left cheek and ear, hurting her.\n\nShe began to scream, asked that he stop, and told him he was hurting her. He responded that he enjoyed seeing her in pain.\n\nShe reached for his hands in an attempt to push him off of her, but he pulled off her shirt and bra, bit and aggressively sucked her nipples, leaving bruises, “all for the sake of debasement and his own sexual pleasure,” reads the indictment.\n\nAt around 5:15 p.m., a siren went off, signaling a missile launch, and they together ran to a nearbyshelter. She cried the whole time.\n\nWhen the all-clear signal was sent out, they smoked a cigarette together outside. Lacks put out the cigarette on her left arm, saying, again, that he enjoyed seeing her in pain, and leaving a cigarette-butt-shaped burn mark.\n\nThey then returned to the park; she was dizzy from all the alcohol and fell to the floor, lying on her stomach. He grabbed her behind and aggressively massaged it.\n\nHe then told her to follow him out to an area close to some nearby trees so he could urinate. He left his pants down, his genital area exposed, and asked if she wanted to have sex with him.\n\nShe said no, and he asked instead if she would service him anyway. She said no, he asked again, and after she again refused and turned to leave, he grabbed her by her hair, turned her around, and rubbed himself up against her.\n\nHe again asked if she wanted to have sex, and she again refused.\n\nHe raped her then, holding her by her head.\n\nShe managed to break from his grasp and turned to leave, but due to her intoxicated and incapacitated state, she again lay on the grass. He lay next to her and put his hand into her underwear. She tried to swat it away, but he pressed on.\n\nHe then grabbed her hand and forced it into his pants to touch him, asking her if she “knows how to suck well, with teeth.” She responded negatively, and he asked her, again and again, if he could put it in her mouth. He eventually did that, against her will, until he finished.\n\nHe was arrested on June 22. The charges against him are rape, indecent acts with force and assault, aggravated assault, and personal injury.\n\nThe prosecution noted that her recollections of the event were consistent in questioning, and that her parents and sister bore witness to her physical and emotional state after the attack. The victim also told a close friend what had happened to her.\n\nLacks denied all the charges against him.\n\nElem, an association for teens-at-risk, said in response: “We believe [her]... It is up to all of us to take responsibility and face reality. This necessitates a thorough and fundamental check of how the system handles cases like these.” It added that it deals with hundreds of sexual assault cases in teens-at-risk every year.\n\n“We have to remember that sexual assault victims won't always be able to come forward. When such an attack takes place, not just the victim but their entire circle gets hurt.”",

    "News_text":"PalmdaleMayor Richard J. Loawas stripped of his title and removed from all committee and city assignments Tuesday night, pending an investigation into “confidential allegations.”\n\nThe dramatic move unfolded during acontentious city council meeting.\n\nThe events began when City Attorney Alexandra Halfman requested Loa recuse himself from a confidential agenda item, citing an alleged conflict of interest. Loa questioned the addition of the item and its confidentiality.\n\nFollowing an hour-long closed session, Councilwoman Andrea Alarcón introduced an emergency agenda item based on “information that was just recently brought to light,” she stated.\n\nDespite Loa’s objections, the council — excluding Loa — unanimously voted to remove him from all committees and committee assignments and strip him of his mayoral title, pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday evening to KTLA, Loa called his dismissal “political theater,” and said his removal was not the result of a “legitimate process,” but was instead a power grab by his former colleagues.\n\n“The council added a so-called ’emergency item’ in violation of the Brown Act and proceeded in closed session, without notice, evidence, or public input. That’s not how democracy works,” Loa wrote in a list of grievances provided to KTLA.\n\nHe continued by saying he has not been told by any members of the council what he’s been accused of, alleging that the council engaged in a “secret trial” that lacked due process.\n\n“If this is how they treat the Mayor, imagine what they’re doing to staff and residents behind closed doors,” the statement reads.\n\nLoa was appointed to the Palmdale City Council in 2018 and served as Mayor Pro Tem three times before becoming mayor on Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nIn 2022, the city eliminated direct mayoral elections, opting for an annual rotation among council members. However, in April, the council voted to scrap that system, allowing the mayor and mayor pro tem to be chosen by a majority council vote and granting the council authority to replace a mayor mid-term. Loa was the lone dissenter in April’s vote,according to the Antelope Valley Press.\n\nMayor Pro Tem Laura Bettencourt will assume mayoral duties in the interim.\n\nLoa, meanwhile, says he plans to continue to fight the decision and claimed the truth would eventually come out.\n\n“I will not be intimidated into silence,” he said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"The link between cancer and exercise that patients should know",
    "News_text":"We all know that regular exercise has many benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\nExercise also improves outcomes in patients with cancer, according to a new study published in theNew England Journal of Medicine. Patients with cancer who participated in a structured exercise program in a randomized-controlled trial lived longer without cancer recurrence and had a lower risk of dying within the trial period compared with people in the control group.\n\nI was curious why and how exercise reduces cancer risk, and what everyone should know about incorporating exercise programs in their lives. To find out, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.\n\nCNN:Why are the results of this study so important?\n\nDr. Leana Wen:Previous research suggested that exercise could be beneficial for cancer survivors, but this is the first randomized trial that demonstrates exercise after cancer treatment can reduce recurrence and improve survival.\n\nResearchers recruited nearly 900 patients from 55 cancer centers across six countries who had been treated for either stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer. Even after cancer treatments such as surgery followed by chemotherapy, colon cancer comes back in anestimated 30%of patients, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Many patients with recurrence of their colon cancer end up dying from their disease.\n\nThe patients in the new study were randomized to two groups. The control group received standard health education materials promoting healthy eating and physical activity. This is the current standard-of-care that is provided to patients in remission from their cancer.\n\nThe other group participated in a structured exercise program that involved working with a health coach for physical activity guidance and supervised exercise sessions. During the initial six months, patients had twice-a-month coaching sessions. After that period, they met with coaches once a month, with extra sessions available if needed.\n\nParticipants randomized to the structured exercise group had significantly higher improvements in physical function as measured by distance they could walk in six minutes and predictedVO2 max(your oxygen uptake), both indicators of cardiovascular fitness.\n\nThe two groups were followed for an average of about eight years. During this period, 131 patients in the control group had recurrence of their cancer, compared with 93 in the structured exercise group. In the control group, 66 people died, compared with 41 in the structured exercise group.\n\nPeople in the structured exercise group had a 28% lower risk of developing recurrent or new cancers compared with those who followed standard-of-care protocols. Members of the exercise group also had a 37% lower risk of death in the trial period.\n\nThis study is important because its rigorous methodology confirms what previous research had suggested: Exercise extends disease-free survival for patients with cancer and should be incorporated as part of holistic treatment for patients to reduce their risk of recurrent and new cancers.\n\nCNN: How might results of the study change treatment for patients with cancer?\n\nWen:Imagine if there were a clinical trial for a new drug that found it lowered the risk of developing recurrent or new cancers by 28% and lowered the risk of death in the trial period by 37%. Patients and doctors would hail this as a tremendous development and would be eager to try this new therapeutic.\n\nThat’s the magnitude of the findings in this study. I believe they have the potential to substantially change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, after patients receive treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, they are given advice to exercise, but many probably do not engage the services of a health coach or trainer. Their oncologists and primary care doctors may not be asking about their physical activity regimen during follow-up care.\n\nI hope this will change, in view of these results. Patients can be counseled to have an “exercise prescription,” and health care providers can follow up to track their exercise activity. Perhaps insurance companies could even consider reimbursement for a health coach for patients with cancer; this could be seen as an investment to reduce the need for costlier chemotherapy and other treatments down the line.\n\nCNN: Why and how does exercise reduce cancer risk?\n\nWen:Population studies havelong shownthat regular physical activity is associated with lower risks of developing certain cancers. There areseveral theoriesas to why this is the case. One is that physical activity helps people stay at a healthy weight, which is notable because obesity is a risk factor for developing some cancers. In addition, exercise is thought to help regulate some hormones that are implicated in cancer development and to reduce inflammatory response that could also be involved in cancer.\n\nCNN: How much exercise do people need?\n\nWen:TheUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendsthat adults participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise per week. For someone who is exercising five times a week, that’s about 30 minutes at a time of exercises such as a brisk walk or jog, riding a bike or swimming.\n\nThe benefits of these exercise minutes are cumulative, meaning that individuals don’t need to do them all at once to have an effect. People who are unable to commit a period of time to exercise could consider how they could incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Could they take the stairs instead of the elevator at work? If they do this five times a day, that could be as many as 10 minutes of exercise. Could they take a 10-minute phone meeting while walking in their neighborhood instead of sitting at a desk? Could they park a bit farther away to get in a few more minutes of physical activity? Small changes add up.\n\nCNN: What other advice do you have for people who want to begin exercise programs?\n\nWen:Many studies show that while it’s ideal to get the recommended 150 minutes a week of exercise, there is asignificant benefitfrom even a small amount of physical activity. The best advice I can offer is to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good — start with what you can.\n\nFor instance, consider the idea of “exercise snacks,” or bursts of activity that could be as short in duration as 15 or 30 seconds. These are as simple as doing a few squats or performing household chores. Getting up from your chair and just moving around helps, which is especially important for desk-bound workers whoneed additional exerciseto counter the negative health impacts of sitting.\n\nSign up forCNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series.

    "News_text":"Washington— The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence arm plans to cut nearly three-quarters of its full-time employees, shaving its Office of Intelligence & Analysis down from about 1,000 staff to just 275, according to four sources briefed on the matter.\n\nThe exact timing of the cuts remains unclear; sources tell CBS News the staff reductions have been in the works for months but were temporarily on hold because of rising tensions overseas after the recentU.S. strikeson Iranian nuclear facilities. The decision has raised concerns among the nation's police and intelligence gathering agencies, as the U.S. reckons with a heightened threat environment.\n\nDHS' Office of Intelligence & Analysis — created after the September 11 terrorist attacks — is the only member of the U.S. intelligence community tasked with sharing threat information to state, local, tribal and territorial governments across the country.\n\nA DHS spokesperson confirmed the cuts in a statement, saying the department is getting \"back to its core mission of prioritizing American safety and enforcing our laws.\"\n\n\"DHS component leads have identified redundant positions and non-critical programs within the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Department is actively working to identify other wasteful positions and programs that do not align with DHS's mission to prioritize American safety and enforce our laws.\"\n\nLast month, the current head of the agency, Daniel Tamburello, informed the intelligence agency's workforce that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had signed off on plans to slash the agency by hundreds of employees, with others reassigned to other DHS components, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nThis week, House and Senate lawmakers wrote to Noem and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, warning them to avoid \"this drastic and unilateral step and instead to consult with Congress about alternative ways to make I&A as effective and efficient as possible.\"\n\n\"At a time when DHS is rightly warning about an elevated threat environment from terrorists and cartels, we should be focused on plugging security gaps rather than senselessly creating new ones,\" Democratic Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Jim Himes of Connecticut wrote Wednesday, along with Michigan Sen. Gary Peters and minority leaders on the House Homeland Security Committee, House Intelligence Committee and Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n\nSeveral law enforcement agencies — including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, County Sheriffs of America and the Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies — also penned a letter to Noem, pressing her to reconsider. They warned that any downsizing of the intelligence agency could prevent \"vital intelligence\" from reaching the officers and investigators whose job it is to detect and disrupt threats and could create \"dangerous blind spots in our homeland security network.\"\n\n\"[Intelligence and Analysis] is the only component of the U.S. intelligence community with a statutory mandate to share threat information with state and local partners,\" the letter stated. \"The current threat landscape makes our partnership with [Intelligence and Analysis] more critical than ever. Ongoing Middle East conflicts heighten risks of foreign-directed and homegrown violent extremism, as demonstrated by the recent antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado. Transnational criminal organizations continue to shift fentanyl trafficking routes, requiring real time intelligence to intercept deadly substances before they reach our streets… Weakening [Intelligence & Analysis] would undermine our ability to detect and prevent threats before they occur.\"\n\nMike Sena, president of the National Fusion Center Association, a network of 2,000 public safety officials operating as hubs of information sharing and threat analysis for local law enforcement, also wrote to congressional leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last month. He warned that \"any reduction in [Intelligence and Analysis'] field-based presence, staffing, or engagement capabilities would negatively impact the critical information flow and coordination necessary to identify and mitigate emerging threats to our communities.\"\n\nLeaders within the National Sheriffs' Associations had a similar message for congressional leaders last month, writing in a letter to GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, that \"[Intelligence & Analysis] is a critical partner in the operations of many of the country's regional fusion centers… at the center of detecting threats from organized crime, threats to election security, and threats from domestic violence extremism.\"\n\nLast month, DHSactivated its National Terrorism Advisory System, alerting more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide of possible \"violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators seeking to attack targets perceived to be Jewish, pro-Israel, or linked to the US government or military in the Homeland.\"\n\n\"US law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020,\" the bulletin read. \"During this timeframe, the Iranian government has also unsuccessfully targeted critics of its regime who are based in the Homeland for lethal attack.\n\nOffices within the intelligence community, including theCIAandNational Security Agency, have faced similar buyouts and workforce reductions in recent months, as well as thenation's top cyber defense agency.\n\nThe cuts werefirst reported by NextGov\/FCW.\n\nDHS' intelligence wing has faced some criticism in recent years for its collection of intelligence on journalists and protesters during theGeorge Floyd protestsin 2020, plus its failure to disseminate critical intelligence ahead of theJan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nWhile testifying before Congress, Matthew Kozma, Trump's new pick to lead Intelligence & Analysis, underscored the importance of reinforcing the federal government's talent pipeline, telling lawmakers, \"It's imperative that [the agency's] analysts be informed, educated and trained on the latest know-how and toolsets to optimally apply available knowledge, insights, and acumen for mission accomplishment.\"\n\n\"Our intelligence and analytical tradecraft requires a unique combination of skill, curiosity, dedication, vigilance, and trustworthiness to ensure that the information and intelligence we extract and share is correct, comprehensive, and corroborated,\" Kozma said in his opening statement.\n\nSeveral people missing from Texas summer camp amid deadly flooding, officials say\n\nWhat a new DOJ memo could mean for naturalized U.S. citizens\n\nJuly 4 holiday week expected to set record for travelers",

    "News_title":"RFK Jr.'s FDA officials overrode career staff to limit COVID shots",
    "News_text":"Top-rankingFood and Drug Administrationofficials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.\n\nIn amemorandumfollowing Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.\n\nPrasad was namedearlier this yearto replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad waslater elevatedto the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.\n\nNovavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.\n\nPrasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"\n\n\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.\n\nAseparate memoreleased by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.\n\nThe agency's career scientists had initially concludedon April 1that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.\n\n\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.\n\nDocumentsreleasedlast month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.\n\n\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.\n\nUnder Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.\n\n\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had saidat an eventlast year.\n\nIn past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, whoquestioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials — Dr. Phil Krause — is alsonow criticizingmoves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.\n\nAgency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.\n\nMonths before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.\n\nHoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"\n\n\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political — it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.\n\nMakary and Prasad also made this argumentin May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.\n\n\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.\n\nThe FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.\n\nHealth care providers are also allowed to give vaccines \"off-label\" outside of the FDA's label and CDC recommendations, once the FDA has approved sales, though that risks running afoul of insurance coverage and liability protections.\n\nSeveral people missing from Texas summer camp amid deadly flooding, officials say\n\nWhat a new DOJ memo could mean for naturalized U.S. citizens\n\nJuly 4 holiday week expected to set record for travelers",

    "News_text":"You don't need a licence, a helmet or even any training to ride an e-scooter. Just a phone and the right app is all you need to hop on one of the many e-scooters for hire that have been lining city streets around the world in recent years.\n\nTrauma surgeon Christopher Spering says the downside to this low bar for riding an e-scooter is that it's \"still at odds with the necessary safety measures.\"\n\nOnce you reach 20 km\/h, the maximum permitted speed in some cities, any kind of fall can result in serious injury, he says from experience.\n\nEmergency room specialists like Spering are therefore reminding people of the first aid rules that also apply in the event of serious e-scooter accidents:\n\nAlways call emergency services, secure the accident site, calm and take care of the injured person until the ambulance arrives, and don't leave them alone.\n\nIf the injured person is unconscious, check their breathing and, if they are breathing, place them in the recovery position.\n\nIn cases of suspected head injuries, keep the head stable and avoid moving the person. If the recovery position is necessary, try not to turn the head.\n\nStop any severe bleeding by applying pressure to the wound with a clean cloth.\n\nFor visible fractures, avoid moving the affected limbs and stabilize them if possible.\n\nIf someone is seriously injured in an e-scooter accident, it is most often a head injury, according to a study from the Clinic for Trauma Surgery at Germany's Technical University of Munich.\n\nSkull fractures, lacerations, dislocations, brain injuries, contusions, spinal injuries, dental injuries and burns are among the most common e-scooter injuries listed in a 2021 meta-study by Canada's public health authority.\n\nWearing a helmet with an e-scooter is not mandatory in many countries, yet trauma surgeons strongly advise it.\n\nRiding an e-scooter is safer for those who travel at less than 20 km\/h, stay sober and ensure they are highly visible, especially at night. The German study also found that most e-scooter accidents occur at night and involve alcohol and male riders.\n\nExperts say the best way to ride an e-scooter is to stand as far back as possible with your knees slightly bent. Additionally, don't brake abruptly. Instead, reduce your speed and drive very, very cautiously if you want to avoid tipping over into the street.\n\nThe wheels don't always have the best traction, so when you're trying to brake on a slippery surface, be sure to use both the front and rear brakes - if you have both, of course.",

That’s the highest number ever recorded for the July 4th travel period.\n\nAAA’s Texas officesuggeststhat road trippers should plan ahead:pack an emergency kit, check those tires, and don’t forget to fill up before heading out.\n\nLast year, AAA came to the rescue nearly 700,000 times during the holiday week for everything from dead batteries to flat tires and, yes, drivers locking themselves out of their cars.\n\nGas prices are friendlierthan many expected, too.\n\nDespite some recent jitters in the oil market driven by conflict in the Middle East and the looming hurricane season, summer gas prices remain the lowest since 2021, under the Trump administration.\n\nFor Texans staying close to home, popular routes include the classic Houston-to-Galveston stretch down I-45, which is expected to see heavy traffic in both directions on weekends.\n\nFrom July 3 to July 6, the Texas Department of Public Safety willintensify patrols statewideas part of Operation CARE (Crash Awareness Reduction Effort). The initiative aims to keep roads safer by targeting risky driving behaviors such as speeding, driving under the influence, and failing to follow the state’s Move Over, Slow Down law.\n\nAs previously reported byThe Dallas Express, officers issued around 5,000 speeding tickets, more than 1,500 citations to uninsured drivers, and hundreds of tickets to people not wearing seatbelts during their July 4th crackdown in 2024. In addition, DPS arrested 212 people for DWI and another 250 on various felony charges last year.\n\nIf your plan involves a TSA line, you’ll have plenty of company.\n\nMore than 5.8 million people are expected to fly over the holiday period, a slight increase over last year’s record. The average domestic round-trip ticket price sits around $810, up 4% from last summer.\n\nTravel expertssuggest booking midweek flights, such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays, for better deals and fewer headaches, according to AAA.\n\nBeyond cars and planes, nearly 4.8 million Americans will travel by bus, train, or cruise. That number is just shy of the pre-pandemic record set in 2019.\n\nWhere are Americans going?\n\nWhen it comes to destinations, it’s amix of classic summer hotspots and bucket-list cities.\n\nDomestically, Orlando, Seattle, and New York top the charts. Alaska cruises are also peaking, and Hawaii’s beaches are calling, according to the report.\n\nInternationally, Canadians will see many American tourists in Vancouver, while Rome, Paris, and London remain the European favorites.\n\nTiming Is Everything\n\nIf you’re driving, when you leave matters as much as where you’re going.\n\nAccording to traffic data firm INRIX, theworst times to be on the road are generally afternoon and early evening hours, especially on July 2 and July 6.\n\nThe best strategy?Hit the road early, before noon, and try to avoid the midday bottlenecks.\n\nAsDXhas previously reported, late-night driving on weekends can be especially deadly in the Lone Star State, regardless of whether it’s a holiday weekend or not.\n\nData based on NHTSA crash records from 2019 to 2023 revealed that the hoursbetween 9 and 10 p.m. are the deadliest on Texas roads.

    "News_text":"‘We’re still living with the aftermath’: Floridians brace for fresh hurricane season\n\nIdalia. Debby. Helene.\n\nNot visiting friends, not neighbors. All hurricanes that have not yet faded into memory for the residents of Taylor County in Florida, where all three powerful storms hit in just two years.\n\n“It’s hard to look at these hurricanes as memories when we’re still living with the aftermath and worrying about what’s coming next,” said Thomas Demps.\n\nAfter taking direct hits from Hurricane Idalia in August 2023, Hurricane Debby in August 2024 and Hurricane Helene in September 2024, Demps, a current county commissioner and former mayor of the town of Perry, said residents of the county are recovering and bracing at the same time as 2025’s hurricane season now looms, Economic Hardship Reporting Project and The Guardian report.\n\n“Taylor County sustained an incredible amount of damage from the three major storms that came through, and we are still recovering,” he said. “We are very fortunate to not have lost any lives, but the damage to property and structures has been heartbreaking.”\n\nBut with less than a month before the start of hurricane season on June 1, residents like businessman Jared Hunt are still recovering from the catastrophic damage from the past two years. In August 2023, Idalia caused major damage to Hunt’s home, and the storm surge came within a foot of the Keaton Beach convenience store he owns with his wife. Still, wind damage and power loss caused the Hunts to lose more than $50,000 in food and supplies at the store.\n\nHelene wasn’t as merciful.\n\n“Our house was damaged beyond livable condition,” Hunt said. “As far as the store goes, we came back to absolutely nothing. The canopy over the fuel dispensers is all that was left. The 3,000-square-foot building I left to evacuate was gone. There was nothing to do but push the rubble to the road for pickup.\n\n“We did get some money from our flood insurance but only about one-fifth of what the policy was for, and that went straight to the mortgage note. Our wind and contents coverage sent us a check around the end of March for $4,000.”\n\nHunt said he’s trying not to worry about the hurricane season approaching, but it’s hard not to when it hasn’t been a year since Hurricane Helene destroyed his home and business.\n\n“Our only options after Helene were to build 17 feet in the air, or everything had to be road-ready in case of another flood,” he explains. “So while we fought with insurance, we bought a few 53-foot semi-trailers and rigged them up like campers with 50-amp services so they could be unplugged and moved away in a short amount of time.”\n\nThe Hunts opened their makeshift store in early May.\n\n“We are doing what we can to get through the summer and pay off some bills, then we’ll start navigating the rebuilding process,” he said.\n\nMore hurricanes make landfall in Florida than any other state in the country, so a hurricane could hit the state during any active hurricane season. Because scientific data shows that ocean and coastal waters are getting warmer amid the climate crisis, it is likely that a hurricane will hit the state during an active season.\n\nDanny Glover, the Taylor County emergency management director, has spent the past eight months preparing for the certainty of another hit — not the probability. Glover, who took the lead in Taylor County’s efforts to recover and rebuild in October 2024, has flooding on his mind, as well as the terrible impact of hurricane-force winds.\n\nLocated on Florida’s Big Bend — the Gulf Coast region where Florida’s peninsula curves into its panhandle, Taylor County’s coastal areas “are more vulnerable to flooding than ever before,” Glover said.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, global warming and climate change are causing ocean warming and rising sea levels, which has fueled the increasing strength and frequency of hurricanes. The NOAA data projects sea levels to rise 2 to 3 feet by 2100.\n\nHurricane Idalia, a Category 4 storm, devastated hundreds of homes and businesses on the coast and inland in the town of Perry. Debby arrived almost a year later, hindering recovery efforts and causing significant damage. And then Helene, a Category 4, barreled across the county.\n\nHelene caused catastrophic damage, particularly in coastal areas. Keaton Beach experienced the destruction of approximately 90% of its homes. Overall, between 250 and 300 homes along the coastline were rendered destroyed or uninhabitable, leading to estimated damages exceeding $50 million.\n\nThe destruction extended inland in Perry, where the mayor, Ward Ketring, said the city has “recovered fairly well, but there’s still a ways to go.” Ketring, along with the city’s other leaders, have used the past three hurricanes to prepare for the probability of another hurricane hitting the area.\n\n“We now have some of the best-trained experts with storm preparedness and storm recovery,” he said. “I wish we didn’t have so much experience with it, but it wasn’t our choice. The staff is getting more experience with each storm.”\n\nBut in a red state like Florida — especially one run by the hard-right Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis — the role of climate change in preparing for hurricanes is never straightforward.\n\nIn May 2024, weeks before hurricane season began, DeSantis signed a law that deleted references to climate change from statutes in the nation’s hurricane capital. Polls conducted in March and April 2025 by Florida Atlantic University and by Mainstreet Research for MediaLab found that a majority of Floridians — 88%, according to the FAU poll — are concerned that climate change is causing more frequent and increasingly destructive storms.\n\nKevin Wagner, the co-founder of FAU’s PolCom Lab, is not surprised that when it comes to climate change political lines are blurred in Florida. “People’s views are a product of their environment,” he says. “In Florida, where people experience the effects of hurricanes first-hand, voters may be more inclined to come to their own conclusions about storm intensity, regardless of their political affiliation.”\n\nLongtime residents of Taylor County agree.\n\nReal estate agent Ann Hodges suffered damage to her home, community and family’s pine acreage, which created an economic drain on the family’s resources, including their retirement funds. “I have always understood that climate change affects the weather, the number and severity of storms, and other catastrophic events such as floods and fires across the nation.

    "News_title":"Ohio education budget: EdChoice funding rises, some (not all) controversial measures vetoed",
    "News_text":"Jul. 3—Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law on Monday a two-year state budget that includes numerous changes to K-12 education across the state.\n\nThere were multiple controversial proposals that DeWine vetoed, but others now set to become law.\n\nOne of the vetoes included a provision many school treasurers and superintendents opposed that would have required schools to return money to taxpayers if they had more than 40% of their budget left over at the end of the year.\n\nSeveral local superintendents, including Oakwood's Neil Gupta, Northmont's Tony Thomas, Beavercreek's Paul Otten, Fairfield's Billy Smith, and Clark-Shawnee's Brian Kuhn have testified against the bill, along with school treasurers and board members.\n\nThat and other property tax related measures DeWine vetoed could see an attempt from the Ohio Statehouse GOP supermajority to override the governor with a three-fifths vote.\n\nSchool Funding\n\nOverall, funding for Ohio's schools is higher than previous budgets, providing an increase in funds for private school vouchers, public schools with high performance metrics or increased enrollment, and increased funding for charter schools.\n\nFunding for traditional school districts under the version of the budget that DeWine signed is $8.22 billion in the 2025-2026 school year, and $8.31 billion in 2026-2027.\n\nBut advocates for public education say the current budget does not fund public education at the level promised in previous legislation.\n\n\"Ohio's educators remain profoundly disappointed in the failures of this General Assembly to fully and fairly fund the public schools that serve 90 percent of the students in our state,\" the Ohio Education Association, one of the teachers' unions in Ohio, said in a statement. \"Our lawmakers must do better for our public school students, educators, and communities.\"\n\nIn 2021, lawmakers negotiated the Fair School Funding plan, which was designed to provide more funding to public schools. Since then, lawmakers have only partly funded the plan.\n\nSome local public schools, such as Lakota and Centerville, could see an increase in funding under the latest version of the budget. But others, such as Northmont, could see a cut.\n\nThere will also be a funding increase of $376 million across Ohio's five main scholarship programs: EdChoice, EdChoice Expansion, Cleveland, Autism and Jon Peterson Special Needs.\n\nThe amount of money that families are able to get for the Autism Scholarship and the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship will go up, capped now at about $34,000.\n\nFamilies using those scholarships can get virtual help beginning in October.\n\n\"While we hoped for more bold advancements, we remain committed to building on this foundation and continuing the work to ensure access to the right educational fit for every child,\" said Yitz Frank, president of School Choice Ohio, a nonprofit that advocates for private and charter schools.\n\nSTRS board members reduced\n\nThe budget proposed a cut to members of the board on the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, the state teacher's pension fund.\n\nInstead of seven elected teachers, including five active teachers and two retired, three elected seats will remain, including two educator seats for current teachers and one retired.\n\nElected members will be able to finish their terms, but after the term ends, four of the seven positions will not be filled. The most recently elected members are retired member Rudy Fichtenbaum and active teachers Chad Smith and Michael Harkness.\n\nDeWine did not veto the item.\n\nOther items vetoed\n\nThere were multiple other items DeWine vetoed. — With a DeWine veto, school board members and educational service center board members do not need to go through a primary election and appear on the general ballot with a political party designation. — DeWine vetoed educational savings accounts for nonchartered schools, which do not have a charter from the state and are generally unregulated. The law would have made a program available to get state funding for tuition and other expenses through the account. — Another school finance-related item, which could have pushed down the amount of money schools that do not collect much property tax could collect, was vetoed. For schools who are at the 20-mill floor, or the bare minimum amount of millage that schools will collect under state law, the calculation would have changed to include emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property taxes.\n\nDeWine said he would convene a working group including legislators, agency officials, school officials, community members and property tax experts to discuss the issue of property tax reforms. Property taxes and state funding make up most of school funding, and the amount of state funding depends on how much the local property is worth.\n\nAnother controversial measure DeWine did not veto prohibits Dayton Public Schools students from using school-issued Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority bus passes to go through the downtown Dayton RTA hub next school year.",

    "News_title":"Republican donors and Florida's hurricane know-how helped build 'Alligator Alcatraz' so quickly",
    "News_text":"In a matter of days, an isolated training airport in the Everglades where endangered Florida panthers roam became a sprawling immigration detention center christened\"Alligator Alcatraz,”modeled after the state’s frequent responses tohurricanesand built in part by companies whose owners have donated generously to Republicans.\n\nIt’s been less than two weeks since the state seized the property from Miami-Dade County. Massive tents have been erected and a steady stream of trucks carrying portable toilets, asphalt and construction materials have been driving through the site inside the Big Cypress National Preserve around the clock in what environmentalists fear will have a devastating impact on the wildlife in the protected wetlands.\n\n“We are dealing with a storm,” said Jae Williams, spokesman for Republican Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is credited as the architect behind the proposal. “And the storm’s name isimmigration.”\n\nThefirst detainees arrivedThursday at the facility, which will cost $450 million to operate and consists of tents and trailers surrounded by razor wire on swampland about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami.\n\nRepublicans named it after what was once one of the most notorious prisons in the U.S. and have billed it as a temporary lockup that is essential toPresident Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nOpponents decry it as a political stunt and fear it could become permanent. The Republican Party of Florida has taken to fundraising off the detention center, selling branded T-shirts and beer koozies emblazoned with the facility’s name.\n\n“The proposal was rolled out without any public input in one of the most ecologically sensitive regions of Florida, and arguably the United States,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, which is among environmental groups thathave suedto stop the project.\n\nSome GOP donors whose companies helped build and will assist in running the facility are being given seven-figure sums. Five Democratic state lawmakers who tried to visit the site Thursday issued a statement calling it “a pay-for-play scheme to enrich GOP donors under the pretense of border enforcement.” One of the lawmakers, state Sen. Shevrin Jones, posted on social media that they were denied access.\n\nFlorida built ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ using expertise from its response to hurricanes\n\nHot, humid summers; regular flooding; and wildlife that includes alligators and venomous snakes make the area where the detention center is located inhospitable to long-term living.\n\nFor the state emergency management staff leading the project, it wasn’t unlike responding toanother hurricane, just with more chain-link fencing, and barbed wire stretching more than 28,000 feet, according to state officials.\n\nFlorida’s leaders pride themselves on the state’sdisaster response capabilities,an expertise sharpened by tropical storms that sweep ashore year after year. Florida had a system and a command structure, as well as a fleet of vendors ready to help set up portable generators, floodlights, temporary kitchens and bathrooms, officials said.\n\n“We understand how to act fast without bureaucracy in the face of any emergency,” said Kevin Guthrie, director of Florida's emergency management division, sitting alongside DeSantis and Trump in one of the temporary shelters during an unveiling event at the facility. “We’re able to translate this knowledge to what we did here,\" Guthrie added.\n\nHuman rights advocates say this is not a storm, but people — people who could be left indefinitely in inhumane conditions.\n\nUthmeier said the location had the advantages of an existing site and a 10,500-foot (3,200 meters) runway, with the Everglades serving as a natural security perimeter. For DeSantis, the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent from escape, much like the California island fortress Republicans named it after.\n\nIt’s also another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying onscare tacticsto persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.\n\nGOP donors will get paid for ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ work\n\nVendors chosen for the project include Lemoine CDR Logistics and CDR Health Care, companies led by Carlos Duart, a major Republican donor who along with his businesses have given millions of dollars to political committees for DeSantis, Trump and other GOP candidates, according to federal records. CDR Companies has been a go-to vendor for the state for years, and it provides engineering, emergency management and health care services across the country.\n\nDuart confirmed his companies’ involvement to The Associated Press but declined to specify the services they’re providing, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Asked if his businesses were picked because of his political support, he said, “we get chosen because we do exceptional work.”\n\nA database of state contracts also showed that Granny’s Alliance Holdings Inc. signed a $3.3 million contract to provide meals at the facility. IRG Global Emergency Management had inked a $1.1 million deal to provide “flight and operational support\" services. Some of the company’s vehicles were seen at the facility, according to images shared with the AP.\n\nIn a sign of its importance to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, the president toured the facility Tuesday. The White House posted on its social media account a graphic of the president standing besides alligators sporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement ball caps under text of “Alligator Alcatraz: Make America Safe Again.”\n\nThe Everglades ecosystem is fragile\n\nIn recent decades, $3.9 billion in federal and state funds have been allocatedto restore grasslandsin the Everglades. The ecosystem was degraded and transformed when a highway connecting Tampa and Miami was built in 1928.\n\nIn response to the environmental groups' lawsuit over the detention center, the federal government said in court papers that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security hadn’t authorized or funded the facility, which the state built and will operate.\n\nHowever, Florida plans to seek payment from the federal government.\n\nDeSantis has described it as temporary, with no plans for sewers, and claims there will be “zero impact” on the Everglades. His administration reiterated that stance in court papers responding to the lawsuit.\n\nBut opponents still fear it will become permanent.\n\n“If it becomes more permanent, that is a bigger concern since that permanently evicts these species from the site so they can never come back,” said Elise Bennett, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, which also joined the lawsuit trying to stop the construction. “Our concerns are great now and will only become greater as this project proceeds.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky:@mikeysid.bsky.social.

    "News_title":"Severe thunderstorm watch affecting 10 Massachusetts counties until Thursday night",
    "News_text":"A severe thunderstorm watch was issued by the National Weather Service on Thursday at 1:31 p.m. in effect until 10 p.m. for Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk and Worcester counties.\n\nLightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away.\n\nTo protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration:\n\nLightning safety plan:\n\nWhen venturing outdoors, it’s vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.\n\nStay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it’s a clear indication of nearby lightning.\n\nSeek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors.\n\nIndoors safety measures:\n\nOnce you’re indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors.\n\nThese precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways.\n\nWait for the all-clear:\n\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n\nIt’s important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.\n\nWhen indoor shelter isn’t available:\n\nIf you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.\n\nSteer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n\nIf you’re in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n\nCamping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning.\n\nDo not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\n\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\n\nRain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\n\nBeware of swollen waterways:\n\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\n\nMaintain safe driving distances:\n\nAdhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.\n\nSlow down and stay cautious:\n\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\n\nChoose your lane wisely:\n\nStick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.\n\nPrioritize visibility\n\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\n\nWatch out for slippery roads:\n\nBe extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.\n\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\n\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\n\nMind your windshield wipers:\n\nOverloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\n\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\n\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down.

    "News_text":"A federal court filing on Thursday casts doubt on the Trump administration’s claims that the federal government would pick up the tab for the immigration detention facility hastily built in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”\n\nDuringPresident Donald Trump’s visitahead of the facility’s opening this week, he said the Federal Emergency Management Agency would pay for the construction and operation of the site, which was built to temporarily house 3,000 immigrant detainees as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s struggles to find space.\n\n“We took the FEMA money that Joe Biden allocated to pay for the free luxury hotel rooms where he’s paying hundreds of millions of dollars in New York City, and we used it to build this project,” he said.\n\nThe estimated cost for a year of operations was $450 million. The Florida Department of Emergency Management, which gets some of its funding through FEMA, used taxpayer money to get the project going but had been expecting to be reimbursed by Washington for at least some of the costs.\n\nThursday’s filing came in response to environmental activists’ demands that a judge block the opening of the facility because of effects on plants and wildlife in the sensitive ecosystem.\n\n“Florida is constructing and operating the facility using state funds on state lands under state emergency authority and a preexisting general delegation of federal authority to implement immigration functions,” Trump administration attorneys wrote to the judge. “Any potential federal funding claims are unripe. Florida has received no federal funds, nor has it applied for federal funds related to the temporary detention center.”\n\nIt’s not clear when a reimbursement will happen, if ever. On Instagram, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the money would come from FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program.\n\nWhether congressional approval will be needed to shift that money is also to be decided.\n\nIf Congress gets involved, Democrats would likely object to funding being used to house immigrants under tents, despite the administration’s claims the tents are rated for Category 2 force winds.\n\nOthers may object to FEMA funding being used for detention centers instead of preparing or recovering from the upcoming hurricane season.\n\nGov.

    "News_title":"The Most Dangerous (and Safest) States to Drive on the 4th of July Revealed",
    "News_text":"Each Fourth of July, Americans pack the roads to enjoy fireworks and barbecues, and that heavy travel contributes to an increase in deadly crashes, according to a new study.\n\nFuture Bail Bondsexamined five years of crash data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to reveal where and when drivers face the greatest risks on Independence Day. Between 2019 and 2023, 2,394 people lost their lives on July 4th alone, underscoring a hidden danger of the holiday.\n\nMontana ranks as the deadliest state to drive in on Independence Day, with afatal crashrate of 15.75 per million residents, more than double the national average of 6.63.\n\nThe most dangerous hour? Between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., when post-fireworks traffic collides with fatigued or impaired driving. State Routes 35 and US-87\/89 are particularly high-risk, with rural stretches and sparse law enforcement, which may potentially add to the danger.\n\nOther states rounding out the top five deadliest include:\n\nMississippi, with a crash rate of 12.57, peaking between 3 and 4 p.m., likely tied to daytime travel and holiday gatherings.\n\nNorth Dakota, at 12.44, with its riskiest hour between 9 and 10 p.m., especially on local roads like Burleigh Avenue West.\n\nWyoming, with 11.86 crashes per million, sees the highest risk during the early evening hours.\n\nSouth Dakota, at 11.81, sees the most deadly crashes between 11 p.m. and midnight, particularly on Interstate 90 East.\n\nWestern states feature heavily among the most dangerous, highlighting a pattern of higher crash risks in rural, lower-density areas.\n\nAcross the nation, late evening consistently emerges as the most dangerous time to drive on July 4th. Between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., many drivers are returning from fireworks shows or heading home from parties, creating a risky mix of fatigue, impaired driving, and congested roads.\n\nLocal roads, not just big highways, see many of these tragedies. From small county roads in Mississippi to main streets in North Dakota, the study shows you don’t have to be on the interstate to face deadly consequences.\n\nThe study also highlighted where you’re least likely to experience a fatal crash on the 4th of July. Hawaii ranked as the safest state, with acrash rateof just 1.38 per million residents, 81% below the national average. Shorter travel distances, lower speed limits, and less road-tripping likely play a role in keeping fatal crashes down.\n\nOther safer states include:\n\nRhode Island, with a rate of 1.78 per million\n\nMassachusetts, at 2.36 per million\n\nWest Virginia, at 3.39 per million\n\nNew Jersey, at 3.53 per million\n\nMany of these states have strong seatbelt laws, a robust police presence, or dense road networks with lower average speeds, which help minimize severe crashes.\n\nWhile Montana tops the list, other states with high fatal crash rates on Independence Day include South Carolina, Kentucky, and Delaware. On the opposite end, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington also appear among the safest.\n\nKey risk factors the study highlighted include:\n\nThe hour of the day, with crashes often spiking after dark\n\nRural roads, which can leave crash victims far from emergency help\n\nAlcohol and speed, consistently cited as major contributors\n\nThe analysis examined fatal crash rates per million residents on July 4th from 2019 to 2023 using NHTSA data. Researchers ranked each state based on its five-year fatal crash rate, and also highlighted the highest-risk hour of the day and the roads most frequently involved in these deadly collisions.\n\nIf you’re planning to celebrate with fireworks and festivities, plan ahead:Avoid driving late at night if possible\n\nDesignate a sober driver\n\nWatch your speed, even on familiar local roads\n\nExpect heavy traffic and stay patient\n\nThe 4th of July should be a day for celebration, not tragedy. Being mindful of where and when you hit the road can help ensure you enjoy the holiday safely.",

According to AAA, July is the peak month for grill fires nationwide.\n\n“There’s about 9,000 every year,” said AAA spokesperson Elizabeth Carey. “So making sure that you’re prepared, keeping an eye on the food that you’re cooking, and having a fire extinguisher nearby can really make a difference.”\n\nCarey also noted that homeowners could be held responsible if fireworks they set off cause damage to cars or houses.\n\n“If you’re blowing off fireworks and they end up falling on a car or a house… you could be held liable,” she said.\n\nFire departments are asking people to stick to legal fireworks only, specifically ground-based devices like sparklers.\n\n“Nothing that shoots up in the air,” said Brad Sprague, Chief of the Main-Transit Fire Department. “Most fireworks from out of state are illegal and cause more of a fire hazard and risk for health and safety.”\n\nAs for fireworks noise, police said complaints are common this time of year, but ask the public to consider whether it’s an emergency before calling.\n\n“If it’s a loud noise complaint, you can call the non-emergency number,” O’Callaghan said. “But we don’t want to tie up services when there are also actual emergencies we have to go to.”\n\nOfficials said a little extra caution can help keep the holiday festive and avoid unnecessary danger.\n\nGwyn Napier is a reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "News_title":"Israel says Trump’s plan to resettle nearly two million Palestinians from Gaza is ‘still active’",
    "News_text":"The Israeli government said Thursday thatDonald Trump’s plan to relocatenearly two million Palestinians from Gaza is “still active,” despite widespread opposition from U.S. allies and warnings from rights groups that it would constitute a war crime.\n\n“President Trump has made clear that plan is most definitely still active,” Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said in response to a question fromThe Independentabout the plan’s status.\n\n“We think it's a good idea. The Prime Minister has praised the idea. It's certainly out-of-the-box thinking,” he added.\n\nThe White House did not deny the plan was still a possibility when asked byThe Independent.\n\n“President Trump has long advocated for creative solutions to improve the lives of Palestinians, including allowing them to resettle in a new, beautiful location while Gaza rebuilds,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said.\n\nThe comments come ahead of a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House next week, where he will meet with Trump to discuss a potential ceasefire with Hamas and the future of Gaza.\n\nTrump first pitched his plan for the United States to “take over” and rebuild Gaza as the “Riviera of the Middle East” in February, calling the territory a “demolition site” and suggesting that Palestinians would have “no alternative” but to leave.\n\nRights groups said the plan to move Palestinians en masse in the midst of waramounted to a forcible transfer, and could constitute a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.\n\nTrump later appeared to back off the plan, telling Fox News host Brian Kilmeade in late February: “I’ll tell you, the way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it.”\n\nBut the comments from Israel’s spokesperson suggest the plan may still be on the table.\n\n“President Trump and [White House Middle East negotiator] Steve Witkoff, they are both in former lives property developers, and the international experts have said that to rebuild Gaza from the mess which Hamas created will take 15 to 20 years,” Mencer said.\n\n“Why on earth should Gazans continue to live in those conditions if there is an opportunity for them to seek sanctuary elsewhere?” he asked.\n\nSince Trump pitched his plan, Israel has launched another major offensive that included the forcible transfer of Palestinians to southern Gaza, which Netanyahu claimed was to “protect” civilians from the fighting.\n\nIsrael’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the aim of the operation, launched in May, was “to conquer the Gaza Strip.”\n\nHundreds have died in the offensive, many of them while seeking aid at new aid points set up in southern and central Gaza in an Israeli-backed effort run by an American non-profit and funded by the Trump administration to the tune of $30 million.\n\nFormer officials from the U.S. State Department and USAID who have worked on emergency aid delivery described the new aid system as “grotesque”, “dangerous” and part of a larger plan to use aid to control the movement of Palestinians.\n\n“A basic principle of humanitarian response is you move the aid as close as you can to where the people are. They’re doing the opposite of that, the diametric opposite of that, which suggests that they want to draw people to the south,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw famine relief at USAID for three years during the Obama administration and is now president of Refugees International.\n\n“I think that is highly suggestive of the longer-term agenda here,” he added.\n\nIsrael has made no secret of its desire to encourage what it has described as the “voluntary” relocation of Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Arab countries, all of whom have rejected the plan.\n\n“Einstein was the person that said that repeating the same thing again and again, and expecting a different outcome is the first sign of insanity,” Mencer, the Israeli government spokesperson, said on Thursday.\n\n“We believe that withdrawing from Gaza and then just allowing Hamas to regroup, to rebuild themselves and attack us again as they say they wish to do, is simply not an option after October 7th,” he added.\n\nNetanayhu is set to land in Washington DC on Sunday and meet with Trump the next day primarily to discuss Gaza and the impact of the joint Israeli-US strikes on Iran. Pressure is mounting on Israel to agree to a ceasefire deal after the US President promised a truce for Gaza could be sorted as earlier as next week.\n\nThe Israeli premier, in his third visit to Washington since Trump returned to office in January 2025, is also due to meet Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth as well as Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nThe Independentunderstands a delegation from Hamas is already in Doha, to meet Egyptian and Qatari negotiating teams. The main sticking point for the deal has been Hamas’s calls that it must lead to a permanent end to the fighting – Palestinians also have concerns about the ongoing occupation of Gaza by Israel troops, and who will rule the Strip.",

    "News_title":"Advocates say New Jersey budget falls short of affordable housing needs",
    "News_text":"Advocates say the budget state lawmakers approved Monday undercuts funding for affordable housing. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)\n\nAdvocates accused New Jersey lawmakers this week of underfunding affordable housing in the$58.8 billion annual budgetthey approved Monday.\n\nThe budget diverts money from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which supports the construction and preservation of housing for people earning at or below 80% of an area’s median income.\n\nState officials anticipate collecting $130 million during the current fiscal year for the fund, but under the new budget will divert $125 million from affordable housing development and rehabilitation. That leaves just $5 million, which can only subsidize around 40 homes, according to the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.\n\nThe diverted funds will instead be used for programs that help first-generation home buyers and rental assistance, which were separate budget items in previous years, according to the Fair Share Housing Center.\n\nStaci Berger, the network’s president and CEO, said the diversion contradicts years of coordinated planning with developers and investment in housing projects.\n\n“It is tone-deaf and irresponsible to use this money for anything other than its intended purpose,” Berger told the New Jersey Monitor.\n\nARutgers-Eagleton pollreleased in May found that New Jersey residents support using the trust fund for its original purpose and enacting legislation to lower housing costs. More than half of New Jerseyans said their housing costs aren’t affordable and are getting worse, the poll found.\n\nJag Davies is a spokesman for the Fair Share Housing Center.\n\n“Affordable housing benefits everyone in New Jersey, not just the residents, and addresses so many other social and economic problems at the root,” Davies said.\n\nThe disinvestment comes at a critical time, as July 1 marked the start of New Jersey’sfourth round of affordable housing obligationsthat go through 2035, Davies noted. By law, every municipality must submit a plan for how it will meet its affordable housing obligations.\n\nNew Jersey has an affordable housing shortage of nearly 290,000 fewer affordable homes, according to the network.\n\nPeople of color are disproportionately impacted, Berger said. New Jersey’s persistent racial wealth gap is nearly double its pre-pandemic levels, the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice found in an Aprilreport.\n\n“White folks have just significantly more wealth due to the equity in their homes, and unless we change the homeownership dynamic and undo 400-plus years of systemic and institutional racism that has permeated our lending market and our housing system, we aren’t really going to tackle that wealth gap in a meaningful way,” Berger said.\n\nStill, the final budget was not without wins for people who need affordable housing.\n\nLawmakerspassed legislationin both houses allowing the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to distribute up to $100 million each year in tax credits to support the development or rehabilitation of affordable housing over coming years. The program does not replace the trust fund but will help, advocates say.\n\nAdvocates urged policymakers to support other proposals, some of which already are in the Statehouse pipeline, including:\n\nRaising the eviction filing feeas a deterrent for landlords and a revenue source to fund eviction prevention programs, such as emergency rental assistance.\n\nAdding a surcharge on the sale of luxury homes.\n\nAdding a luxury landlord fee that can be forgiven if the landlord provides affordable units with inclusionary zoning or caps rent increases.\n\n“Legislators need to urgently prioritize protecting vulnerable tenants and facilitating affordable housing development,” Davies said. “Without enhanced tenant protections, New Jersey and other states around the country are going to see a massive wave of evictions in the coming months and years.”\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_text":"The Fourth of July is synonymous for many Oklahomans with setting off fireworks at home —if they are legal in your town, of course.\n\nIt's not uncommon to head over to your family's July Fourth cookout and take a lighter to everything from smoke bombs, snakes and sparklers to rockets and even large artillery shells that explode in the night sky. But what do safety experts say about these at-home fireworks displays?\n\nHere's what you need to know ahead of your holiday plans.\n\nWant to see fireworks?Here's where to celebrate the Fourth of July 2025 in the OKC metro area\n\nAccording to the National Safety Council,fireworks \"may be legal but they are not safe.\"\n\nThe council urges Americans not to use any fireworks at home, but instead enjoy them at public displays put on by professionals.\n\nMore:Don't call 911 to report illegal OKC fireworks. What to do instead, what to know about ban\n\nAccording to theU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, there were 11 reported fireworks-related deaths in 2024. Most of these involved misuse or device misfire\/malfunctions.\n\nIn addition, an estimated 14,700 people were injured by fireworks in 2024. About 1,700 emergency-room-treated fireworks injuries involved sparklers.\n\nIf fireworks are legal in your city or town, and you choose to use them, the National Safety Council says it's crucial to follow safety advice.\n\nHere are the safety tips from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission:\n\nDon't let young children play with or ignite fireworks, even sparklers. Sparklers burn at about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt some metals.\n\nIn case of a fire, keep a bucket of water or a garden hose nearby.\n\nOnly purchase and set off fireworks that are for consumer, not professional use.\n\nDon't set off fireworks while impaired by drugs or alcohol.\n\nLight fireworks one at a time, then move back quickly.\n\nDon't try to re-light or pick up fireworks that have not ignited fully.\n\nFollow all instructions and warnings on fireworks and never hold them in hand unless instructions specify to do so.\n\nNemours KidsHealthalso recommends staying at least 500 feet away from where fireworks are being launched to prevent injuries and hearing damage.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Oklahoman:Are fireworks safe?

    "News_title":"Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America",
    "News_text":"Jul. 3—LAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.\n\nMayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point \"you couldn't even walk down the street\" in Lake Providence's main business district because \"there were so many people.\"\n\n\"It's gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,\" said Amacker, a Democrat. \"The town, it looks like it's drying up. And it's almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.\"\n\nNow, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana's uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according to state data, despite it having the highest poverty rate in the U.S. that year.\n\nA man sits behind his desk. Lake Providence Mayor Robert \"Bobby\" Amacker sit behind his desk. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nThis week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause 11.8 million more Americans to become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.\n\nRepublicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn't be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.\n\nThe Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — where almost half of the state depended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade, according to KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.\n\nResidents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.\n\n\"If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that's going to be bad,\" said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.\n\nA dilapidated building. Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nMedicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.\n\nEven though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn't — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.\n\nOn a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she's heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn't heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they're even on the table.\n\n\"I don't like that. I don't think they should put a stipulation on that,\" Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It's hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.\n\nErvin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it's one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.\n\nErvin's job offers health benefits, but she can't afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.\n\nIn East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of people live below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times the national poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.\n\nExpansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.\n\n\"Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can't pay to get help,\" Ervin said.\n\nIt's a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate in Washington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nGreenville, the county seat, is among the fastest-shrinking cities in the U.S. It's still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.\n\nGreenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.\n\nApril McNair April McNair, 45, is a resident of Greenville, Miss. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nThe result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn't cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master's degree.\n\n\"I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,\" McNair said. \"I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.\"\n\nMcNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"That's a selfish move. To me, they're selfish,\" McNair said, adding that now she's worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.\n\n\"God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?\"\n\nHard to thrive\n\nMississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.\n\nDelta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.\n\nIt was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.\n\nBut it wasn't easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, the white-owned Bolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would \"lead further to socialized medicine.\"\n\nA 1966 editorial.

(Photo by Kim Krisberg\/Public Health Watch)\n\nThe situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.\n\nPeople who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.\n\nBlack residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.\n\nA 2001 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with \"limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,\" said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.\n\nEven some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.\n\n\"There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,\" Richardson said. \"And I don't see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.\"\n\nRichardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"America doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,\" she said.\n\nThat's why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.\n\n\"Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,\" Smith said. \"They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.\"\n\nTwo people laughing. Dr. Brent Smith, left, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville, laughs with a co-worker. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nIn Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recent report, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana's overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, in Mississippi it was 10.5%.\n\n\"Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had the same level of closures of facilities,\" said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.\n\n\"Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.\"\n\nNow, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.\n\nAmerica doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own. — Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System\n\nIn East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.\n\nBrown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn't want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.\n\n\"We have one bank. We have one supermarket,\" she said. \"Transportation isn't easy either.\"\n\nLocal infrastructure is so limited, she's even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.\n\n\"There's nowhere to go,\" Brown said.\n\nDominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don't have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who'd be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.\n\n\"This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn't have any kind of health care at all,\" Mayor Amacker said.\n\nA dilapidated building. Dilapidated buildings dot downtown Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nEven a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn't offer affordable health insurance.\n\nNevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker's office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can't afford the premiums for private insurance.\n\n\"I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they're still struggling,\" she said.\n\nAt the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it's like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.\n\n\"They want to do stuff for the rich people that's already rich,\" she said. \"What are they doing? It's almost like there's no common sense with them.\"\n\n'The tremble factors'\n\nWhile leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump's tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.\n\nMorris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There's no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.\n\n\"It doesn't take the pain away,\" she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville's Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. \"It does reduce the pain so that I'm able to function. But it's rough.\"\n\nJennifer Morris. Jennifer Morris, 44, a Greenville, Miss., resident, poses for a photo at Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nMorris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.\n\nMorris' Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.\n\nBut Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.\n\nMississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which \"would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,\" harming \"services and access to care,\" says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.\n\n\"It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,\" he said.\n\nLeonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you're already starting from so far behind. He thinks the \"big, beautiful bill\" will create more roadblocks for poor people.\n\n\"You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,\" said Favorite, 70.\" That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.\n\n\"Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.\"\n\nNational researchers estimate that up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.\n\nBut national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while 2023 census data show 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid, state health data reviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.\n\nExperts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it's difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.\n\nState Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states' ability to collect those taxes.\n\nDepending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippi could lose hundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.\n\n\"It's unavoidable that when you're taking that much money out of the system, that there's not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,\" Roberson said.\n\nLast week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed a statement calling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress \"historic in their devastation.\"\n\nFrom her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can't understand the attacks on Medicaid.\n\nNewton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic's patients have Medicaid insurance.\n\nJennnifer Newton is the executive director of the Family Medical Clinic. Jennnifer Newton is the executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence, La. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nNewton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. \"It's absolutely helped,\" she said. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nIn 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults in East Carroll Parish was nearly 35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.\n\n\"Why are we going back?\" Newton asked. \"We've made so much progress.\"\n\nRepublican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according to KFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.\n\nBrian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements \"can be met by not just work,\" so \"concerns seem pretty overstated.\"\n\nMedicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.\n\n\"It's hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there's not jobs. There's always work to be done,\" Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is \"the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.\"\n\nBut advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access is notoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well as paperwork errors — not because they weren't working enough.\n\n\"Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they're going to lose coverage and become uninsured,\" said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nData shows Arkansas' experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.\n\n'Take a step back'\n\nPeople in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.\n\n\"People spent their lives uninsured,\" said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. \"Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.\"\n\nLake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.\n\nRecent estimates show up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump's tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.\n\n\"People are actually trying,\" McNair said. \"I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn't have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. ... Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you're doing.\"\n\nThis story is part of \"Uninsured in America,\" a project led by Public Health Watch that focuses on life in America's health coverage gap and the 10 states that haven't expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStateline reporter Shalina Chatlani can be reached at [email protected].

According to Herrmann, the injured are a woman from Syria and her son, as well as another Syrian and a fourth person. The police had spoken of people aged 15, 24, 38 and 51.\n\nIt is also not yet clear whether the attacker and victims knew each other. \"From what we know so far, he spoke to them immediately beforehand,\" Herrmann explained. He assumes that he was at least aware that they were also Syrian.\n\nThe attacker was a refugee who had a residence permit in Austria and was legally in the country, Herrmann said.\n\nThe Bavarian investigating authorities were co-operating with the Austrian authorities.

    "News_title":"Republican megabill will mean higher health costs for many Americans",
    "News_text":"This story is from Kaiser Health News\n\nThe tax and spending legislation the House voted to send to President Donald Trump's desk on Thursday, enacting much of his domestic agenda, cuts federal health spending by about $1 trillion over a decade in ways that will jeopardize the physical and financial health of tens of millions of Americans.\n\nThe bill,passed in both the House and the Senate without a single Democratic vote, is expected to reverse many of the health coverage gains of the Biden and Obama administrations. Their policies made it easier for millions of people to access health care and reduced the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows, though Republicans say the trade-off was far higher costs borne by taxpayers and increased fraud.\n\nUnder the legislation Trump's expected to sign on Friday, Independence Day, reductions in federal support for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplaces will cause nearly 12 million more people to be without insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That in turn is expected to undermine the finances of hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers — which will have to absorb more of the cost of treating uninsured people. Some may reduce services and employees or close altogether.\n\nHere are five ways the GOP's plans may affect health care access.\n\nNeed Medicaid? Then get a job\n\nThe deepest cuts to health care spending come from a proposed Medicaid work requirement, which is expected to end coverage for millions of enrollees who do not meet new employment or reporting standards.\n\nIn 40 states and Washington, D.C., all of which have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, some Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption, such as caring for a young child. The new requirement will start as early as January 2027.\n\nThe bill's requirement doesn't apply to people in the 10 largely GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid to nondisabled adults. Health researchers say the policy will have little impact on employment. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees who don't receive disability benefits already work or are looking for work, or are unable to do so because they have a disability, attend school, or care for a family member, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.\n\nState experiments with work requirements have been plagued with administrative issues, such as eligible enrollees losing coverage over paperwork problems, and budget overruns. Georgia's work requirement, which officially launched in July 2023, has cost more than $90 million, with only $26 million of that spent on health benefits, according to the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\n\"The hidden costs are astronomical,\" said Chima Ndumele, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\nLess cash means less care in rural communities\n\nBelt-tightening that targets states could translate into fewer health services, medical professionals and even hospitals, especially in rural communities.\n\nThe GOP's plan curtails a practice, known as provider taxes, that nearly every state has used for decades to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers and private managed-care companies.\n\nStates often use the federal money generated through taxes to pay the institutions more than Medicaid would otherwise pay. Medicaid generally pays lower fees for care than Medicare, the program for people over 65 and some with disabilities, and private insurance. But thanks to provider taxes, some hospitals are paid more under Medicaid than Medicare,according to the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit.\n\nHospitals and nursing homes say they use these extra Medicaid dollars to expand or add new services and improve care for all patients.\n\nRural hospitals typically operate on thin profit margins and rely on payments from Medicaid taxes to sustain them. Researchers from theCecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Researchwho examined the original House version of the bill concluded it would push more than 300 rural hospitals — many of them in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma — toward service reductions or closure.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate tacked a $50 billion fund onto the legislation to cushion the blow to rural hospitals. The money will be distributed starting in 2027 and continuing for five years.\n\nHarder to get and keep ACA coverage\n\nFor those with Obamacare plans, the new legislation will make it harder to enroll and to retain their coverage.\n\nAffordable Care Act marketplace policyholders will be required to update their income, immigration status and other information each year, rather than be allowed to automatically reenroll — something more than 10 million people did this year. They'll also have less time to enroll; the bill shortens the annual open enrollment period by about a month.\n\nPeople applying for coverage outside that period — for instance because they lose a job or other insurance or need to add a newborn or spouse to an existing policy — will have to wait for all their documents to be processed before receiving government subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums. Currently, they get up to 90 days of premium help during the application process, which can take weeks.\n\nRepublican lawmakers and some conservative policy think tanks, including theParagon Health Institute, said the changes are needed to reduce fraudulent enrollments, while opponents say they represent Trump's best effort to undo Obamacare.\n\nThe legislation also does not call for an extension of more generous premium subsidies put in place during the covid pandemic. If Congress doesn't act, those enhanced subsidies will expire at year's end, resulting in premiums rising by an average of 75% next year, according to KFF.\n\nOn Medicaid? Pay more to see doctors\n\nMany Medicaid enrollees can expect to pay more out-of-pocket for appointments.\n\nTrump's legislation requires states that have expanded Medicaid to charge enrollees up to $35 for some services if their incomes are between the federal poverty level (this year, $15,650 for an individual) and 138% of that amount ($21,597).\n\nMedicaid enrollees often don't pay anything when seeking medical services because studies have shown charging even small copayments prompts low-income people to forgo needed care. In recent years, some states have added charges under $10 for certain services.\n\nThe policy won't apply to people seeking primary care, mental health care or substance abuse treatment. The bill allows states to enact even higher cost sharing for enrollees who seek emergency room care for nonemergencies. But if Medicaid patients fail to pay, hospitals and other providers could be left to foot the bill.\n\nCuts for lawfully present immigrants\n\nThe GOP plan could cause at least hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are lawfully present — including asylum-seekers, victims of trafficking and refugees — to lose their ACA marketplace coverage by cutting off the subsidies that make premiums affordable. The restriction won't apply to green-card holders.\n\nBecause the immigrants who will lose subsidies under the legislation tend to be younger than the overall U.S. population, their exit would leave an older, sicker, and costlier population of marketplace enrollees, further pushing up marketplace premiums, according to marketplace directors in California, Maryland, and Massachusetts and health analysts.\n\nTaking health care access away from immigrants living in the country legally \"will do irreparable harm to individuals we have promised to protect and impose unnecessary costs on local systems already under strain,\" John Slocum, executive director of Refugee Council USA, an advocacy group,said in a statement.\n\nThe bill reflects the Trump administration's restrictive approach to immigration. But because it ran afoul of Senate rules, the legislation doesn't include a proposal that would have reduced federal Medicaid payments to states such as California that use their own money to cover immigrants without legal status.",

    "News_title":"Changes come to GLTS student dress code",
    "News_text":"ANDOVER — A change to the Greater Lawrence Technical School student handbook looks to create more uniformity within the school’s walls with how the students dress for classes and shops.\n\nThe School Committee narrowly approved the student handbook by a vote of 3-2, with one member abstaining from voting, during its meeting on Thursday.\n\nChanges included not having a nurse present at student activities after school hours or on the weekends. School staff present at the events will be responsible for calling 911 in the case of an emergency. Other changes added sports teams or removed clubs from the handbook and academic eligibility for student athletes.\n\nOne change involved student dress code. Committee members weighed in on the school’s uniform policy where all students must wear the same, black shirt regardless if it’s a shop or academic week for the students.\n\nSuperintendent John Lavoie said most of the student handbook will stay as it includes language regarding safety gear and proper footwear in the dress code.\n\nHowever, there will be some change to the uniform policy. All Career and Technical Education (CTE) uniforms will consist of a black shirt with the school logo and the specific career shop of the student on the front. Matching sweatshirts will be available.\n\nThe uniforms will be worn during both academic and shop weeks.\n\nLast school year’s student handbook allowed the CTE shops to have different color shirts to signify which students were in GTLS programs. Colors ranged from maroon, dark green, indigo blue, light and dark gray, green, red and other varieties.\n\nEach program has different permitted pants, footwear and safety regulations such as no jewelry depending on specific career areas. All freshmen were required to wear a black top, jeans or khaki pants, safety boots and clear safety glasses as outlined in the 2024-2025 student handbook.\n\nCommittee member Anne Marie Faris, representing Andover, opposed the uniform change and was one of the two against its passage. She said she felt what was in the handbook was acceptable and should have remained as written.\n\n“Who thinks this is going to work?” Faris asked during the meeting.\n\nFaris said she sees the uniforms working with underclassmen, but not juniors and seniors. She added she’s all about choice.\n\n“I don’t see how they are going to go 10 days straight, how many shirts are they going to have?” she said.\n\nLawrence committee member Ziola Disla supported the uniform change, saying it’s as “simple as it gets” with students wearing one color.\n\n“Now they don’t have to worry about if it’s academic or shop,” Disla said.\n\nMethuen committee member Bradley Jones said he understood why going with the same color would work as Lavoie had previously mentioned the school had random amounts of other colors leftover. He said he feels students will adjust to the change.",

    "News_title":"Update: Prepare for damaging winds and quarter-sized hail with thunderstorms in Hampden and Worcester counties Thursday",
    "News_text":"At 6:28 p.m. on Thursday, the National Weather Service released an updated severe thunderstorm warning in effect until 7:15 p.m. for Hampden and Worcester counties.\n\nWind gusts of up to 60 mph and quarter-sized hail (1 inch) are anticipated.\n\n\"At 6:28 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located over Eastford, or 12 miles northeast of Mansfield, moving east at 35 mph,\" says the weather service. \"Hail damage to vehicles is expected. Expect wind damage to trees and power lines.\"\n\nLocations impacted by the warning include Johnston, Mansfield, Windham, Plainfield, Smithfield, Killingly, Webster, Southbridge, Burrillville, Uxbridge, North Smithfield, Dudley, Scituate, Glocester, Putnam, Thompson, Sturbridge, Douglas, Brooklyn and Woodstock.\n\nThe weather service comments, \"For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a building.\"\n\nEach year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away.\n\nTo ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, consider the following recommendations:\n\nLightning safety plan:\n\nWhen venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning.\n\nStay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's a clear indication of nearby lightning.\n\nSeek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors.\n\nIndoors safety measures:\n\nOnce you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors.\n\nThese precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways.\n\nWait for the all-clear:\n\nAfter the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities.\n\nIt's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution.\n\nWhen indoor shelter isn't available:\n\nIf you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety:\n\nAvoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk.\n\nSteer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees.\n\nIf you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people.\n\nCamping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning.\n\nDo not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks.\n\nIn summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety.\n\nRain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall:\n\nBeware of rapid water flow:\n\nDuring heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk.\n\nMaintain safe driving distances:\n\nAdhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.\n\nReduce speed and drive cautiously:\n\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\n\nChoose your lane wisely:\n\nStick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes.\n\nPrioritize visibility\n\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\n\nWatch out for slippery roads:\n\nThe initial half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mixture of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.\n\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\n\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\n\nMind your windshield wipers:\n\nHeavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas.\n\nWhen stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\n\nIn the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road.

    "News_text":"BATON ROUGE, La. (Louisiana First) – Local fire officials and doctors are reminding residents to put safety first when it comes to fireworks as the Fourth of July approaches.\n\nWhile fireworks are a staple of Independence Day celebrations, they also pose serious risks. According to the Baton Rouge Fire Department, fireworks cause more than 31,000 fires nationwide each year.\n\nFourth of July: Events with music, parades, fireworks shows in, near Baton Rouge\n\n“Sparklers seem like a small, not-really-booming firework, but they cause the most injuries,” said BRFD spokesperson Curt Monte. “Those burn at 1,200 degrees, and they’re putting them in children’s hands.”\n\nMonte recommends that adults supervise all fireworks use, even with items that seem harmless. He emphasized that the safest option is to attend a professional show, but if residents do choose to light their own, they should do so only in open, legal areas—and always have a bucket of water or hose nearby.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Littleton, a general surgeon at Baton Rouge General, said their emergency department typically sees a surge in firework-related injuries this time of year.\n\n“If it’s a minor burn, run cool water over it and keep it clean with soap and water,” Littleton said. “Apply antibiotic ointment. But if it’s a severe burn, seek medical attention immediately—our Baton Rouge Burn Center is here to help.”\n\nIs it legal to shoot a gun into the air in celebration of holidays?\n\nAfter lighting fireworks, Monte urges residents to allow all remnants to fully burn out before disposal.\n\n“What goes up must come down,” he said. “A lot of times, those fireworks are still burning. Let them burn out, pick them up, put them in a metal can, and fill it with water.”\n\nOfficials also remind the public thatfireworks are illegal in many citiesacross Louisiana. Before lighting up the sky, check with your local government to ensure you’re following the law.\n\nWhether you’re at a backyard barbecue or enjoying a block party, local experts say a few safety steps can help prevent a celebration from turning into a tragedy.\n\nAirbnb rolls out anti-party technology in Louisiana before Fourth of July\n\nCongressman Clay Higgins tours Texas flood damage, state and federal relief pours in\n\nMost believe gov’t should play a major role in disaster response, fewer think the same for climate change\n\nIs DoorDash down?

    "News_text":"Several area nonprofits are using the American love for fireworks as an opportunity to raise money for their causes.\n\nAnd some of the customers say they feel better knowing the money they’re burning and blowing up goes to a good cause.\n\n“We shop for fireworks specifically at the not-for-profit fireworks stands,” said Christy Zink, of Joplin, at the fireworks stand at the Forge, a campus of Watered Gardens ministry, at 705 E. 15th St. in Joplin. “That way we’re giving something back. We’re heading to the Jasper firefighters fireworks stand next. If they’re out and willing to put forth the effort, then why not support these causes?”\n\nCalvary Baptist\n\nCalvary Baptist Church, 600 E. 50th St., is holding its third annual fireworks fundraiser this season.\n\n“The community support has absolutely been terrific. We couldn’t ask for better,” said Tracy Reeder, media coordinator for the church.\n\nProceeds benefit the church’s youth and missions groups. Reeder said whatever programs need a bit of a boost throughout the year also will benefit. The youths will usually use some of the money to attend summer camps, which she describes as an important mission for the church.\n\nCalvary Baptist Church is also holding a Fourth of July celebration at 7 p.m. Friday at the church. The event is open to the public and will include music, food, games and family fun. Shortly after dark, church members will put on a fireworks show.\n\n“It’s a good way to tie up the end of the fundraiser, and we still sell during the event too,” Reeder said.\n\nHot sellers early on are children’s fireworks and smaller attractions, Reeder said, but as they get closer to the holiday, people will then purchase the bigger fireworks for their celebrations.\n\nThe stand is open from noon until 10 p.m. Thursday, and from noon until 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. There is a 10% discount for military and emergency responders workers with identification.\n\nWatered Gardens\n\nTravis Hurley, director of advancement at Watered Gardens, said the fireworks stand operated at the Forge raises enough money to put one of the 16 to 24 students through its program for about a year.\n\nThe Forge operates its fireworks tent from 8 a.m.-11 p.m. through July 4.\n\nCaleb Treat, education and wellness coordinator at the Forge, said about 20 men are enrolled in the group’s 16- to 18-month program designed to help individuals struggling with drug abuse, homelessness or other issues get back to living independently.\n\nThe program has five steps that help men “learn from their setbacks, the traumas of their past and grow past them,” Treat said.\n\n“A lot of the guys here are struggling in hard times, and they’re coming off addictions,” Randy Zink said. “Me and my wife, we both know what that’s like, we’ve been there, so we definitely want to support a program that helps people that have been where we’ve been before.”\n\nJasper Fire Protection District\n\nFirefighters in Jasper are staffing a fireworks stand at 120 W. Grand St. to raise money to supplement the budget of the Jasper Fire Protection District, which is not involved as an organization with the fireworks stand.\n\nJasper fire Chief J.R. Goode said firefighters have been hosting the stand since before 2015, when the department became the taxpayer-funded Jasper Fire Protection District.\n\nFor insurance reasons, the district can’t be involved in the fireworks stand, so firefighters staff it when they are off duty.\n\n“We don’t make a ton of money, but all of the profits from the stand go to the firefighters,” Goode said. “We buy like some extra helmets, some hand tools that we put in some of the trucks, just some various odds and ends, things that the district doesn’t need to fund to take the load off the district’s budget.”\n\nGoode said the stand is open from 10 a.m.-10 p.m. through Saturday.",

    "News_title":"Pa. officials warn Medicaid cuts will have ‘devastating effects’",
    "News_text":"Pennsylvania officials and hospital groups warn that there could be dire consequences for Medicaid recipients when the tax and spending bill proposed by President Donald Trump becomes law.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act promoted by Trump was narrowly passed by the House on Thursday, which forwarded it to Trump for signing.\n\nThe bill would cut safety-net programs including Medicaid and SNAP, lower federal taxes for some, put more money into border security agencies and the Pentagon, and add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have denied that the controversial bill slashes Medicaid, but the budget office, Democratic leaders and hospital groups say that Medicaid would in fact be cut for some of the 70 million low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program, resulting in more people seeking care in the emergency room and hurting rural hospitals.\n\nLooking at the numbers\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro’s office said that the proposed changes to Medicaid could strip health coverage from more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians, drive up health care costs, and put rural hospitals out of business. Nearly 144,000 Pennsylvanians who receive SNAP could also lose their access to critical food assistance, he said.\n\nThis week, Shapiro, officials from his administration and rural health leaders spoke at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Wayne County to talk about what they called the “devastating effects” the proposed cuts would have on rural Pennsylvanians and health care providers.\n\nShapiro’s office said that so-called state-directed payments would be necessary to bring average Medicaid reimbursement for Pennsylvania hospitals to 82 cents on the dollar. Without them, that average drops to 53 cents on the dollar.\n\nStatewide, the Senate’s state-directed payment provisions alone translate to a roughly $4.5 billion cut to Pennsylvania hospital payments over the next decade, Shapiro said.\n\nShapiro’s office broke down the estimated cuts by Pennsylvania congressional district. If the bill passes, in Rep. Dan Meuser’s 9th District there would be 17,967 who lose Medicaid coverage and 8,185 who lose SNAP benefits. In Rep. Ryan Mackenzie’s 7th District, 17,519 would lose Medicaid coverage and 6,096 would lose SNAP benefits. And in Rep. Rob Bresnahan’s 8th District, 21,637 would lose Medicaid coverage and 11,572 would lose SNAP benefits.\n\nMeuser, Bresnahan and Mackenzie, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill.\n\nIn addition to losses of health care access and coverage, the legislation would cost Pennsylvania an estimated 526,000 jobs and $71 billion in lost economic impact over the next decade, Shapiro said. He based that on the American Hospital Association’s analysis of state-by-state economic impacts using estimates of state allocation of cuts in the House-passed bill and estimates of additional losses from the Senate provisions.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro, shown at Sterman Masser Potato Farm, Sacramento, in May, joined rural health leaders this week at a hospital in Wayne County to talk about what they called the devastating effects the proposed Medicaid cuts would have on rural Pennsylvanians and health care providers. (MATTHEW PERSCHALL\/MULTIMEDIA EDITOR)\n\nPA Lawmakers react\n\nAfter the bill’s House passage, Meuser said in a statement that the legislation strengthens Medicaid.\n\n“It includes common-sense work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, removes individuals who are ineligible under the law from the rolls, and, beginning in October 2026, it ends the federal cost-share for states that choose to include illegal immigrants in their Medicaid programs — taking serious steps to address waste, fraud and abuse in the program,” he said.\n\n“It also delivers support for rural healthcare, creating a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care. We’re making Medicaid more sustainable, more accountable, and more focused on delivering real results for seniors, the disabled, and low-income families.”\n\nBresnahan said the bill will ensure continued Medicaid coverage by eliminating corruption.\n\n“We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste and abuse that are driving the program toward collapse,” he said. “This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so.”\n\nAlisha Hoffman-Mirilovich, executive director of Action Together NEPA, a political advocacy organization, condemned the bill and the members of the House and Senate who voted to pass it, specifically Bresnahan.\n\n“We are especially disappointed in freshman Congressman Rob Bresnahan,” Hoffman-Mirilovich said. “Rep. Bresnahan repeatedly promised to vote against any bill that guts benefits for the people in his district. And yet, he voted to do just that every single time it was up for a vote. His ‘yes’ vote on the bill’s final passage this morning is the last straw — he can no longer claim that he cares about his constituents losing care.”\n\nOutcry from healthcare professionals\n\nHospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania President and CEO Nicole Stallings spoke earlier in the week about the bill, warning that the Medicaid cuts included in the budget reconciliation bill would cause people to lose health care coverage and destabilize Pennsylvania hospitals and communities.\n\n“This legislation puts health care access, jobs, and economic competitiveness in jeopardy, especially in our rural communities,” she said in a statement.\n\n“More than half of the commonwealth’s acute care hospitals are operating in the red because payments already do not reflect the actual cost of providing care. They cannot absorb a cut of this magnitude, and some will have no choice but to reduce services or close.”\n\nThis week, M. Michael Peckman, director of communications and community engagement for Lehigh Valley Hospital–Schuylkill, said that his health system was “closely monitoring the legislation and the impact the proposed cuts could have on the communities we serve. We will continue to provide the best possible care to patients, regardless of their ability to pay.”\n\nSt. Luke’s University Health Network referred questions to HAP, while Geisinger Health System declined comment.\n\nDuring Shapiro’s event at Wayne Memorial Hospital, Dr. Debra Bogen, the state Secretary of Health, also said the proposed changes to the Medicaid program would have grave consequences for health care across Pennsylvania, from hospitals to individuals in both urban and rural communities.\n\n“When people do not have health insurance, they are forced to forego preventive care and rely on emergency care,” she said. “This, in turn, leads not only to worse health outcomes, but also increases uncompensated health care services, increases insurance premiums, and increases health care costs for all Pennsylvanians — on top of contributing to overcrowded emergency rooms.”\n\n“All of us know someone — whether it’s ourselves, a friend, loved one, or a neighbor — who Medicaid has helped. But no matter how you personally get your health care coverage, Medicaid is vital to protecting the health of your community,” said Department of Human Services Special Adviser Sara Goulet.\n\n‘Shredding of social safety net’\n\nThe impact of the current federal proposal would not end with Medicaid cuts, Shapiro’s office said. The bill does not extend enhanced premium tax credits available to Pennsylvanians who purchase health insurance through Pennie, Pennsylvania’s official health insurance marketplace, officials said.\n\nThese tax credits have made coverage more affordable than ever, and if they expire on schedule at the end of this year, it will also risk health insurance for an additional 270,000 Pennsylvanians, adding to the risk to hospitals and an increase in rates of uninsured and\/or uncompensated care, officials said.\n\n“The enhanced premium tax credits help individuals — including Pennsylvanian farmers, small business owners and families — afford quality insurance coverage and help our rural hospitals keep their doors open with the steady reimbursement for care that they need,” said Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys. “Congress’ proposed cuts to Medicaid and failure to renew these vital tax credits put Pennsylvanians at risk of losing critical access, putting lives and livelihoods in jeopardy.”\n\nAmong the groups criticizing the bill’s passage Thursday was the Pennsylvania Policy Center, with the center’s executive director Marc Stier calling the legislation “morally and economically bankrupt.”\n\n“There is the shredding of the social safety net — deep cuts to Medicaid, the ACA, and SNAP — that will bring physical pain, economic distress, and thousands of premature deaths to the people of Pennsylvania and the United States,” he said.\n\nHe also said the bill was damaging to work to address climate change, shifted more income and wealth to the ultra-rich and wealthy corporations through tax breaks, increased the deficit and made deep cuts in federal support for schools.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Sharif Street was also critical of the bill.\n\n“House Republicans just showed the American people exactly who they work for and it’s not working families,” he said.\n\n“By passing this Big Ugly Bill, they’ve made their priorities painfully clear: tax breaks for billionaires, cuts to essential services and a relentless assault on the progress we’ve made. This bill is a raw deal for Pennsylvania.”",

    "News_title":"'Big Beautiful Bill' likely to make healthcare unaffordable for 2 million Floridians",
    "News_text":"No other state is likely to have more residents' healthcare affected by the passage of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" on July 3 quite like Florida because of how the bill letsAffordable Care Actfederal subsidies expire.\n\nFlorida has the highest proportion of residents enrolled in the government-sponsored healthcare initiative that was the signature effort of former President Barack Obama's administration. The healthcare law, also known as \"Obamacare,\" was enhanced in former President Joe Biden's term with subsidies. Now, though, the first major legislation of President Donald Trump's term, a megabudget bill that advances a wide range of his policies, lets those subsidies expire at the end of the year.\n\nLegislation could be introduced to save the subsidies, but that appears unlikely.\n\nWith the passage of the bill through Congress — and Trump's expected signature — the Congressional Budget Office expects that nearly 2 million Floridians will be without healthcare by 2034.\n\nSome of them will lose it due to new Medicaid rules, but the vast majority of those unable to afford healthcare as a result of the bill is expected to be those receiving Obamacare subsidies. Those expected to find healthcare unaffordable because of the law's passage are mostly concentrated on households earning between 100% and 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. That's a yearly income between $32,150 and $44,367 for a family of four.\n\nMillions more will see their Obamacare premiums rise at the end of 2025, but it's going to hit the lower-income recipients harder.\n\n\"Costs will skyrocket come January for small business owners, gig workers, and Floridians just shy of retirement who will find their premiums will spike — in some cases by over 400 percent,\" said Holly Bullard, chief strategy & development officer for Florida Policy Institute, a research nonprofit, and co-chair of the Florida Decides Healthcare, a campaign to expand Medicaid. \"Many will simply choose to go uninsured — raising costs even more for everyone.\"\n\nOne out of five Floridians get their healthcare through Obamacare and the vast majority of them are eligible for some kind of subsidy to keep premiums lower, according to KFF, a national healthcare research policy organization.\n\nPredictably, reaction to its passage was split along partisan lines. U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Parkland, called it a \"complete disaster.\" U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Stuart, said its passage signified, \"a great day for America.\"\n\nThe megabill that Trump has calling “one big, beautiful bill” advances many administration priorities such as beefing up border security, extending tax cuts from Trump’s first term and providing tax relief for Social Security recipients.\n\nThe bill has come under heavy criticism because of how it changes the societal safety net, dramatically reducing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), adding a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients and changing the rules for hospital funding. It's also estimated to add an estimated $4 trillion to the national debt, including debt service payments.\n\nAnyone can get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, but the range of family incomes that qualify to get government subsidies for their premiums has expanded in recent years to include the middle class.\n\nThe looming expiration was met with pessimism for those who know the recipients.\n\n\"It will shatter healthcare,” predicts Alexander Golubev, who turned to selling ACA policies full time last year through his agency, Atlantic Breeze Insurance in Hallandale Beach.\n\nParts of Hallandale Beach are included in a congressional district where one-third of the residents are enrolled in ACA and the vast majority receive enhanced subsidies for their healthcare premiums.\n\nHe explained further: “Ninety-nine-point-nine-nine- nine-nine percent of the people I work with don't have even $10 to spare every month for additional costs, if there are any for a healthcare plan. Meanwhile, the subsidy is covering, you know, anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per person per month.”\n\nSign-ups for the latest ACA enrollment period in Florida hit a record in January. The number of enrollees receiving the government subsidies doubled between 2020 and 2024, according to an analysis from KFF, a national health policy research nonprofit.\n\nWith an eye to making health insurance affordable for low- to moderate-income enrollees without access to employer-sponsored healthcare, legislation made it so that ACA enrollees qualify for a government subsidy through the ACA Marketplace. The idea is that, with insurance, people will get preventive healthcare and not wait until a condition drives them to a hospital emergency room, which is a more expensive venue for healthcare.\n\nThose making between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for the subsidies. For a family of four, that’s an annual income ranging from $32,150 to about $124,800.\n\nOther qualifications include not having access to employer-sponsored healthcare, or an \"affordable\" plan that costs either equal to or less than 9.02% of one’s household income; ineligible for coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program; and proof of U.S. residency or legal residency.\n\nOn average, those who use the HealthCare.gov to get their ACA as Florida residents do, are now paying an average of $672 per year in 2024, or $56 per month. Without the subsidy, the average premium would rise by 93%, to $1,296, per year, KFF projects.\n\nACA subsidies were enhanced in 2021, under Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which was passed as COVID-19 was raging. Then, in 2022, the subsidies were extended with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Florida residents, collectively, account for $2.2 billion in enhanced subsidies because of the 2022 boost to ACA, KFF found.\n\nThe way it works, those who make less money get more of a subsidy. So the expiration of subsidies would hit those with lower incomes harder, according to KFF’s analysis.\n\nA 30-year-old single person in South Florida making $15,650 — the lowest rung of ACA subsidy eligibility — will be paying $23 more per month for his or her health care premium if the enhanced subsidies expire but will still receive some help, according to a KFF calculator.\n\nBy contrast, that same person making $62,600, near the highest limit to be eligible for a subsidy, would be paying $8 more per month in premiums once the enhanced ACA subsidies expire.\n\nGenerally, subsidies are not repaid to the government unless the recipient earned more than they projected when they enrolled at HealthCare.gov.\n\nFive congressional districts have more than a third of their population getting their health insurance through ACA, KFF’s findings show. Four of those five districts are in South Florida, mostly districts comprising Miami-Dade County, with one including a sliver of Broward County. One of them is in Central Florida.\n\nAnne Geggis is the insurance reporter atThe Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

    "News_text":"SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — Two South Jordan officers who were involved in the fatal shooting of Marcelo Gutierrez in June 2024 will not face any criminal chargesfor their lethal use of force, the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office determined on Thursday.\n\nGutierrezwas shot and killedafter he approached the officers while holding a knife, despite repeated commands from the officers for him to drop the knife. Throughout the incident, Gutierrez was also hit by non-lethal tasers three times before the officers took lethal action, as the tasers were ineffective.\n\n“This is a bit different than our typical use of force in the sense that this incident lasted for 40 minutes,” Sim Gill, Salt Lake County District Attorney said.\n\nThe incident happened on June 2024 when South Jordan Police got a call about a suspect in Glenmoor Park who was reportedly looking through car windows.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Family speaks after officer-involved shooting in South Jordan leaves one dead\n\n“The person was located at an area park and produced a knife as they were contacted by officers,” South Jordan police said in the news release back in 2024.\n\nGill said there were three attempts to tase Gutierrez.\n\n“He was tased, but it had no effect and continued to advance towards Officer Aaron Bas. The officers the continued to give commands as they backed up into the parking lot nearest to the baseball diamond. Gutierrez then walked towards the officers’ parked vehicle near the rest rooms. An officer again deployed their taser, but it had no effect,” Gill noted.\n\nGutierrez then took his knife and stabbed it into the vehicle tire and again advanced toward officers, who continued to give commands.\n\n“After yelling not to tase him, Gutierrez accelerated force towards [South Jordan Police] Officer Jace Tanaka and multiple shots were fired at the suspect,” Gill said. “Gutierrez refused to drop the knife despite being visibly injured.”\n\nEventually, about 22 minutes after shots were fired, a team of officers moved up to Gutierrez and went hands-on, pinning his arm down with a ballistic shield.\n\nRELATED: Vigil held for man killed in South Jordan officer involved shooting\n\nOfficers then removed the knife from him, and he was attended by emergency medical personnel on scene. Gutierrez later died that day at the hospital.\n\nAfter reviewing body-worn camera recordings and other evidence linked to the scene, the Salt Lake County DA’s office has concluded that the “use of deadly force was necessary to prevent death or serious bodily injury to the officer or an individual other than the suspect.”\n\nGill said that they did speak with Gutierrez’s family who acknowledged that Gutierrez had mental health issues.\n\n“I don’t like what happened here. This is clearly a tragic loss as it’s a mental health issue. But at the same time, we are cognizant of the fact of the multiple attempts of the less lethal actions those officers deployed,” Gill said while addressing the media.\n\nGill added that mental health is a serious problem and that officers should prepare themselves to respond to such incidents in an intentional and deliberate way.\n\nOgden Canyon Fire prompts evacuations in Weber County\n\nJazz win Summer League opener over Sixers, 93-89\n\nReal Salt Lake holds on for 3-2 victory\n\nThree vehicle crash leads to fire, explosion at Herriman Strip Mall\n\nVehicle rollover in West Valley City leaves 4 teenagers in serious condition\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Despite Lisa Murkowski’s Deals, Alaskans Will Suffer Under Trump’s Tax Bill",
    "News_text":"WASHINGTON – Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) understands how devastating President Donald Trump’s tax bill is going to be for millions of people around the country.\n\nShe said so right after she voted to pass it on Tuesday.\n\n“This has been an awful process,” she said ina lengthy statement, lamenting both the terribleness of the bill and the rush to get it done. “While we have worked to improve the present bill for Alaska, it is not good enough for the rest of our nation ― and we all know it.”\n\nMurkowski had a shot at potentially killing this bill. With the Senate vote stuck at 49-50, she wavered on how to vote for hours, all through Monday night and into Tuesday morning, as GOP colleagues surrounded her on the Senate floor and subjected her to an intense, exhausting lobbying campaign to support it. She ultimately did, bumping the final vote to 50-50 and clearing the path for Vice President J.D. Vance to break the tie.\n\nThe Housepassed the bill Thursday,and it’s off to the White House to be signed into law.\n\nThis legislation, Trump’s signature domestic policy package, is going toinflict a lot of painand cruelty on a lot of people. It gives immigration authorities $150 billion to ramp up Trump’s mass deportation efforts, with more money for detention centers and more incentives for detaining American children with undocumented parents. It kicks millions of low-income people off health insurance. It takes food assistance away from millions more people and families. In exchange for its more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, it gives a hefty tax break to the wealthiest Americans.\n\nMurkowski seemed to have buyer’s remorse almost immediately after voting for it. In her Tuesday statement, she bizarrely said she wanted to keep working on the bill, even as Republican leaders have been racing to get it to Trump by Friday, leaving little to no chance for more changes to it once it left the Senate.\n\n“My sincere hope is that this is not the final product,” she said. “This bill needs more work across chambers and is not ready for the President’s desk.”\n\nSo why did the Alaska Republican vote for this thing? Her reasoning is as cynical as it is a sign of how broken our politics have become: She was able to add language to the bill shielding her state from some of the suffering the bill will inflict on the rest of the country.\n\nIn exchange for her vote for the bill, Murkowski secured a two-year delay in cuts to her state’s federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid to low-income people — even as this provision, crafted just for her state, createsa bizarre incentivefor states with the highest error rates to overpay their SNAP recipients.\n\nShe negotiated another $25 billion for a now $50 billion fund for rural hospitals, many of which will struggle to survive the bill’s deep Medicaid cuts. She got a perk forAlaska whaling captains. She got more drilling leases for her state. She delayed the termination of wind and solar tax credits, which Alaska benefits from, and stripped a new tax on renewable energy projects.\n\n“I advocated for my state’s interests,” Murkowski told reporters after Tuesday’s vote. “I will continue to do that and I will make no excuses for doing that.”\n\nThe thing is, her constituents are still going to suffer under this bill.\n\nAs many as46,000 Alaska residentsare at risk of losing their health insurance because of the bill’s harsh new work requirements and frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid. Another27,000 Alaskansare at risk of losing food assistance because ofharsh new work requirementsin the SNAP program. The perks Murkowski added to the bill on both of these fronts delay these hits from taking effect by a year or two, but don’t stop them.\n\nWhen the Medicaid cuts take effect, it will put a huge strain on the state’s health care system, with hospitals and clinics potentially being forced to cut services, increase costs for privately insured patients, or simply close. Four rural hospitals in Alaska, which comprise 40% of the state’s rural hospitals with available data, servehigh concentrationsof Medicaid patients.\n\nMurkowski negotiated more money for the previously mentioned $50 billion rural hospital fund to help with this, but it’s not even close to offsetting the bill’s more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid. Rural areas are going to lose $155 billion in federal Medicaid dollars under the bill, peran analysis by KFF, an independent health policy research group. Alaska is estimated to getabout $280 millionfrom the rural hospital fund over five years.\n\nAnother “super concerning” aspect of the bill for Alaska residents relates to the state not having any Level 1 Trauma Centers, said Liz Pancotti, the managing director of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic policy think tank.\n\nWhen Alaskans need Level 1 trauma care, which is the highest level of trauma care for critically injured patients, they are transported via medical evacuation to hospitals in Washington state, Pancotti said. Murkowski may have gotten reassurances from Trump officials that hospitals in her state can access the $50 billion rural hospital fund to offset its Medicaid cuts, but those assurances won’t likely apply to hospitals in Washington state.\n\n“Who knows if that state, which has a Democrat governor and Democrat senators, is going to get any money out of the rural hospital stabilization fund,” she said. “Probably not. And also, they’re not rural. Their centers are on the coast or in the cities.”\n\nPancotti said it will “presumably” be Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy making the calls on which states can tap into the rural hospital fund.\n\n“Why would you give money to the governor of Washington for Alaska?” she asked. “Maybe Murkowski can make that case, but it feels like there’s no guarantee.”\n\nThe state’s budget will also take a huge hit, as Alaska, like all other states, will now have to pay for its share of Medicaid. The bill headed to Trump’s desk would result in Murkowski’s state losingat least $2 billionin federal Medicaid funds over the next decade, per KFF.\n\nState legislators will be pressed to offset those losses by making cuts to state-funded priorities, like education, or by raising taxes. They may also start making decisions about what kinds of so-called “optional Medicaid services” to no longer fund, in order to cut costs. That could mean no longer covering dental care, for example, or home care.\n\nIt’s not as if it’s just Democrats in Alaska worried about the damage this bill will do to the state.\n\n“Alaska cannot afford to lose health care funding,” Bryce Edgmon, the state’s independent House speaker, and Cathy Giessel, the state’s Republican Senate majority leader, said last week ina New York Times opinion piecetitled “Alaska Cannot Survive This Bill.”\n\n“Work requirements instituted in Medicaid are untenable for rural Alaska, with many communities facing limited broadband access and job opportunities,” they wrote. “Alaskans who lose health care coverage will be forced to delay care until it’s an emergency. In desperation, they will end up in emergency rooms, the most expensive place to receive care, resulting in higher premiums for private sector employers and unworkable finances that will most likely force rural hospitals to close.”\n\n“The reality is that most Alaskans on Medicaid are already working,” said the Alaska legislators, “and these provisions just create more barriers and bureaucracy.”\n\nMurkowski and fellow Alaskan Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan knew Trump’s tax bill would have this effect on their state when they voted to pass it. That’s why they tried three separate times, unsuccessfully, to insulate Alaska from the pain of the bill’s Medicaid cuts in the frantic final hours of the Senate’s debate, according to a Senate Finance Committee staffer familiar with the senators’ final efforts on the bill.\n\nIn plain view of reporters watching the Senate floor, aides to the Alaska senators haggled with the Senate parliamentarian, a.k.a. the rules referee, to try to add language to the bill at the last minute to increase the federal Medicaid match for states with the highest levels of poverty under federal guidelines. Alaska and Hawaiilead that list. But the parliamentarian said the change didn’t comply with Senate budget rules, and denied it.\n\nSo the senators tried again, this time by proposing new language to boost the federal Medicaid match for five states with the lowest population densities. Alaska tops that list, along with Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. The parliamentarian said this also violated Senate budget rules and rejected it.\n\nIn a third and final effort to shield Alaska from the bill’s pain, aides to the senators tried to add more money to the bill for the state’s Community Navigator services. These programs help connect people in various communities, particularly tribal communities in Alaska, with the resources they need. The parliamentarian scratched this plan, too.\n\nThe fact that Alaska’s Republican senators were scrambling on the Senate floor at the 11th-hour to do something — anything — to protect their state from the bill’s Medicaid cuts speaks volumes about how badly they wanted to avoid the effects of the GOP bill.\n\nA Murkowski spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about why she voted for the bill knowing that, even with its added perks for Alaska, it would still hurt so many of her state’s most vulnerable residents, never mind millions of people outside of her state.\n\nWho knows if Murkowski could have tanked Trump’s signature tax package for good if she’d voted against it? Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who did oppose it, said he would have supported it if GOP leaders changed a provision in it related to the government’s legal borrowing limit. In that scenario, with Murkowski and Paul swapping votes, the bill still would have passed the Senate but without Murkowski’s goodies for her state in it.\n\n“When I saw the direction this was going, you can either say, ‘I don’t like it,’ and not try to help my state, or you can roll up your sleeves,” shetold NBC’s Ryan Noble, shortly after the bill cleared the Senate.\n\nNot that that justifies Murkowski’s vote, or anyone’s, for such a cruel bill. The reality is that virtually every Senate and House Republican voted for this legislation, and they all know that it’s going to kick down the poorest and most vulnerable people in their states or districts. What sets Murkowski apart from the rest is that it actually weighed on her.\n\nIna Tuesday interviewwith Alaska reporters, not long after she’d casted her vote, she tried to talk about “good things” in the bill, citing its tax cuts, its child tax credits and its new funds for the Coast Guard. She again criticized its rushed process, and said it’s “not a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination.”\n\nMurkowski said nothing about being the deciding Senate vote on legislation that willkick 12 million peopleoff of their health coverage and take food aid away frommillions morelow-income people and families. Instead, she emphasized her commitment to sparing her constituents from some of the pain she had just voted to impose on everyone else.\n\n“I needed to make sure that Alaska’s interests were represented,” she said. “I think I did, I think I did well by the state, in terms of trying to get these accommodations.”",

A truck may have to be pulled from another area, so then if we have a call in that area, a truck needs to be pulled from another adjacent area. That can affect response times adversely,” said Pickens Co.

Pickens County is using some of it to put two additional trucks on the road.\n\n“Getting these additional trucks on the road will be able to allow us to keep our trucks in their main call areas, instead of having to constantly move trucks from one part of the county to the other, which will translate to better response times and a quicker care for our citizens,” said Gibson.\n\nWith those additional resources, the Easley station will be expanded to include room for the new trucks, as well as another bedroom, shower and storage room.\n\n“We have completed the ones at our Central-Clemson area, our medic 4 station.

    "News_title":"'A slap in the face': Georgia and Arkansas' Medicaid work rules may preview the road ahead",
    "News_text":"President Donald Trump isexpected Friday to sign into law his sprawling domestic policy bill, which includes nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans.\n\nDubbed the “big, beautiful bill,” the new legislation will extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and make up for them in part byslashing federal Medicaid funding, introducing copays for some services and — for the first time — implementing nationwide Medicaid work requirements. The final version of the bill didn’t include an estimate of coverage losses;an earlier Congressional Budget Office reportprojected that about 11 million people could lose their health coverage and become uninsured by 2034 because of the program cuts.\n\nMedicaid isjointly funded by the federal government and the states, which usually mandate that applicants meet certain criteria, such as low income, disability or caregiving status.\n\nOnly two states have implemented Medicaid work requirements: Arkansas in 2018 and Georgia in 2023. Georgia’s program, called Pathways to Coverage, remains in effect.\n\nOver the 10 months Arkansas’ work requirement was in place,more than 18,000 people in the state lost Medicaid coverage. Georgia hasn’t done a good job keeping track of how many have lost coverage, but enrollment remains low, said Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.\n\nWhen people lose Medicaid coverage, they view it as “sort of a slap in the face,” Ku said.\n\n“When your income is down, when you’re unemployed, that’s when you lose everything,” he said. “When you’re most in need. That’s when you lose your food assistance, that’s when you lose your health insurance coverage.”\n\nKendall Rogers, 40, of Stone Mountain, Georgia, is looking for a job after he lost his Medicaid coverage this year because of the state’s work requirements, according to his mom, Trudy Rogers, 59.\n\nThe change means Trudy now has to take care of herself for long parts of the day. She has fibromyalgia and nerve problems in her back that make it difficult for her to get around.\n\nKendall was caring for her nearly full time, Trudy said, but Georgia’s work requirements don’t offer exemptions for caregivers for older adults.\n\nShe called the new requirements “an insult not only to him, but to me.”\n\n“Because now he’s forced to go out and look for work, and I need him to stay around the house,” she said.\n\nTo justify the cuts, Republicanshave argued that they’re not taking Medicaidfrom those who are rightfully entitled to it — such as, they say, single mothers or the disabled — but from “young, able-bodied men” who they say are abusing the system.\n\n“If you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money, and you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in April.\n\nBut as seen in Georgia and Arkansas, that’s not who is largely affected.\n\nCynthia Gibson, director of the Georgia Legal Services Program’s Health Law Unit, which helps appeal Medicaid denials, said many people in the state lose coverage not because they aren’t working, but because they aren’t aware of the new rules or face administrative issues like missed paperwork or not having received notices. Others, like Kendall Rogers, are caring for family members but don’t qualify for exemptions.\n\nLikewise, in Arkansas, only 3% or 4% of the people on Medicaid in 2018 weren’t working and didn’t qualify for the exemptions under the state program, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a physician and health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Sommers published a study in theNew England Journal of Medicinein 2019 looking at the impact of Arkansas’ work requirements.\n\nHis research found that about 40% of the other roughly 96% of people on Medicaid in the state were working the required 80 hours a month under the state program. The rest either had medical conditions that prevented them from working or had other responsibilities, such as school or caring for family members.\n\nImplementing work requirements also didn’t result in a higher employment rate — one of the arguments Arkansas officials used in favor of the new work rules.\n\n“Most people, almost everybody, was already doing what [the state] wanted them to do,” he said. Very few were “the proverbial on the couch, video game story that we’re hearing from some of the supporters.”\n\nMost commonly, Gibson said, people aren’t actually aware that they’ve lost coverage until they go see their doctors.\n\n“And that creates kind of a panic,” she said. “Sometimes they may have something really important scheduled that the doctors won’t do when they run their insurance and find out they no longer have coverage.”\n\nGibson said the people most often affected by the work requirement are those in noncorporate jobs, including independent workers — like Uber drivers or delivery workers — who don’t receive regular pay stubs and can’t meet Georgia’s work verification requirements.\n\nOthers include people with certain disabilities that don’t qualify for exemptions, as well as caregivers for children or elderly relatives.\n\nPeople who lose coverage often avoid going to the doctor or getting medical care unless it’s an emergency, because they don’t want to accumulate debt, she said.\n\n“They just don’t get treatment; they don’t go to the doctor,” she said.\n\nHeather Payne, 53, of Dalton, Georgia, couldn’t avoid medical care after she had a series of debilitating strokes in 2022.\n\nUnable to work, she was told she didn’t qualify for an Affordable Care Act plan and didn’t qualify for Georgia’s Medicaid program because she was a childless adult.\n\nShe later enrolled in classes to become a nurse practitioner — a career she could pursue despite her disability. By that point, the state’s work requirement had gone into effect. However, Payne was told she still didn’t qualify for Medicaid because she wasn’t taking enough credit hours. She couldn’t afford to take more.\n\nTo pay for her medical bills, she burned through her $40,000 in savings and is now in collections for tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n“When you have a problem, there’s no help for you,” she said. “It makes you feel as though society doesn’t care what happens to you.”\n\nDimitris Terrell, 49, of Clarkston, also worries her 24-year-old son, Justin Anderson, could start to accumulate debt following changes to Georgia’s Medicaid program.\n\nAnderson doesn’t work, but he has Medicaid coverage because he has Crohn’s disease, a bowel disease that can cause chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nTerrell said her son started having to pay large copays last year, after the state began charging copays for prescription drugs and certain services.\n\nAnderson has paid over $400 out of pocket on doctor’s visits and hundreds of dollars for the dentist, neither of which he could afford, his mother said.\n\nShe also worries about his losing coverage — either because he would no longer qualify or because of missed paperwork.\n\n“He’s pretty sad and shocked,” Terrell said. “He said, ‘Like, Mama, I don’t understand why I have to pay.’”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_text":"SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — With the Fourth of July holiday approaching, officials from the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM) and the National Weather Service (NWS) are sounding the alarm over potential flash flooding in parts of West and Central Texas.\n\nState emergency response teams have been activated in anticipation of heavy rainfall and possible flooding. Wes Rapaport of TDEM emphasized the importance of remaining alert. “It is so important to stay weather aware,” said Rapaport. “You know it’s a great time to travel and spend time with loved ones, but as folks are either traveling away from the Concho Valley or to the Concho Valley—or traveling through the Concho Valley—they need to be paying attention to those threats.”\n\nMeteorologists are closely monitoring a complex weather system affecting the region. Patrick McCullough, a senior meteorologist with the NWS in San Angelo, cited a combination of factors including moisture from tropical systems. “We’ve got a week upper-level storm system across the area, a little bit of moisture from Tropical Flossy that came out of the Pacific, and Barry that came out of the Gulf and into Mexico,” McCullough said. “That kind of set the stage for these scattered rounds of showers and thunderstorms.”\n\nThe storms are expected to bring torrential rainfall, particularly east of the Concho Valley, including the Heartland and Hill Country regions such as Brady, Brownwood, and Fredericksburg. These areas could see localized flash flooding, especially in low-lying regions and near waterways.\n\n“If water starts to come up fast, they are going to have to find a way of coming up to higher ground pretty quick,” McCullough warned.\n\nOfficials are urging Texans to have emergency plans and kits ready, monitor local forecasts, and avoid walking or driving through flooded areas. “We expect this threat to last into Friday afternoon. Once we hit the weekend, we expect that threat to subside,” said Rapaport. “Our main concern is to make sure that people are paying attention heading into the holiday weekend.”\n\nAs the state remains on alert, safety remains a top priority for emergency officials and weather experts alike.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"CHARLOTTE, N.Y. (WROC) – Ahead of the holiday weekend, local law enforcement personnel are giving an update on security at Ontario Beach Park following an uptick in crime over recent months.\n\nWhether it’s a cookout with family or a day spent at the beach, MCSO wants to remind visitors they will be out over the weekend in big numbers.\n\n“Expect to see increased patrols and expect to see high visibility officers and deputies working together up there to make sure everyone can have a fun and safe holiday weekend,” said Deputy Brendan Hurley with MCSO.\n\nOver the last few years, MCSO has been able to boost patrols for holidays like the 4th of July, with progress made in recruitment and reinforcement from surrounding agencies.\n\n“We’ve been fortunate over the last couple years to be able to bolster our patrols. We’ve gotten about 50 more road patrol deputies. That hadn’t increased in several years. For us, it’s mostly about prevention. We don’t wait to wait until there is a problem,” said Deputy Hurley.\n\nBusiness owners like John Kabrovski of Tropix Nightclub have previously shared concerns with News 8 over a spike in violence in Charlotte’s main district. While the area has seen improvements, he says it’s still affecting local business.\n\n“I think what’s happened in the last few weeks and months down here has scared people. People have made their plans to go somewhere else. We’ve got to get the word out that Charlotte is a safe place to be and that the police presence is enormous. They’re here to patrol. They’re not here to give anyone a tough time. They’re here to keep the violence down and keep the trouble away,” said Kabrovski.\n\nVarious Charlotte businesses, including Tropix, will be closed on the 4th of July but plan to reopen Saturday. The change, he says, has taken effect in recent years.

    "News_title":"‘The state listened’ — Unicoi leaders applaud grants",
    "News_text":"ERWIN, Tenn. (WJHL) — Unicoi County leaders and businesses were equal parts relieved and jubilant Friday as word arrived that devastated county businesses would receive millions of dollars in grants from Tennessee’s “Governor’s Response and Recovery Fund.”\n\nBallad CEO: Unicoi County Hospital rebuild in question due to Senate spending bill\n\n“We were still answering the question, ‘could we rebuild?'” Unicoi County Economic Development Director Austin Finch said while standing in front of still-shuttered PlastiExports in the Unicoi County Industrial Park, more than nine months after Hurricane Helene. “And today we had the answer, ‘yes, we can rebuild.'”\n\nFinch said the grants could be just that consequential for several of the six companies in the industrial park that were ravaged by floodwaters from the Nolichucky River.\n\n“We were impacted in a way that without the state’s help, we might not have ever recovered from, and now we have some certainty that we’re going to recover our industrial base.”\n\nState Rep. Renea Jones (R-Unicoi) was among those lobbying for Helene-related grant programs and said Friday offered “a glimmer of hope and definitely time of celebration for the folks that have actually received money.\n\n“In our industrial park, some of our river industry, our farmers, they received some much-needed funds to help them bridge the gap to getting back into business.”A news release from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA), which is administering the grant program, said $41,353,959 had been awarded to 126 projects submitted by businesses, farmers, forest landowners, local governments and nonprofits.\n\n“For businesses in Unicoi County, not just in the industrial park, it’s going to be definitely north of $10 million that’ll be coming in, based off what I’m hearing,” Finch said.\n\nPlastiExports managing partner J.P. Metcalf told News Channel 11 “the funds will allow us to make repairs to the building, add needed infrastructure, and purchase some of the equipment needed to start up production again.”\n\nOCTOBER 2024: 250 employees: Six Erwin industries’ future in limbo amid wreckage\n\nPerry Muse of Foam Products, just a few hundred yards up the temporarily rebuilt road in the park, had a similar response.\n\n“We are thrilled to finally have received notification of approval for funds from the disaster relief program,” Muse said.\n\n“While it will not be enough to return us to 100% pre-hurricane, it will give us an opportunity to restore the facility, electrical infrastructure and partial production capability,” he added.\n\nMuse said he hopes the process following Friday’s announcement is “expedient,” given that after nine months out of production, “we are hanging by a thread.”\n\nWhitewater rafting companies also were hard hit by the disaster, and even more so by its aftermath — prevention of access to the Nolichucky Gorge this year as CSX rebuilds its destroyed rail line through the gorge.\n\n“Whitewater rafting, as a single product, it’s probably the biggest thing that we offer,” Finch said.\n\n“We have an accurate calculation that spend is about $1,000,000 because we have the privilege tax. We know how many people are going down and what their spend is. That’s big for us in our commercial base as well, and many jobs.”\n\nA stone’s throw from PlastiExports, workers were renovating Blue Ridge Paddling, another grant recipient, where the retail and taphouse operation could open by the end of the year, even if rafting the Nolichucky is still close to a year away.\n\nWhile the landscape around the industrial park is a far sight cleaner than it was six months ago, it looks far from normal. Finch said that’s proof that Unicoi County has dealt with some particular problems, including the loss of more than 250 industrial jobs, that most counties in Northeast Tennessee dodged in Helene’s wake.\n\nPREVIOUS: Nolichucky raft guides likely to lose 2025 season in Gorge\n\n“These funds were designed to solve the problems that existed, and we outlined these problems early on,” Finch said. “We identified the gaps and we said, ‘hey, this commercial side of the equation is being entirely left off the table by their funders. This is where a solution needs to come, otherwise, our economy will not bounce back.’ And they did answer that.”\n\nMetcalf thanked Jones, Unicoi County Mayor Bubba Evely and Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger and others who pushed for the aid.\n\n“Many people have been telling our story every chance they had, and fortunately, the state listened,” Metcalf said.\n\nWith rafting activity shut down and the industries just getting back online in a limited fashion, recovery remains in early stages, Finch and Jones said.\n\n“It’ll be much longer before they’re back to full production, back to full employment, but right now we’re beginning that process and stepping in the right direction,” Finch said.\n\n“We know it’s not going to fix everything,” Jones said, adding that some rejection messages have been mixed in with the award emails. “We wish we could. But the fact that there was money allotted in the governor’s budget to do this and be able to help in some small way, I think it’s just it’s a good day in Tennessee.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

But doctors say taking fast action is critical at any age.\n\nAubrey Hasley is happy to focus on homework these days after what started as a typical migraine a little more than a year ago could have turned tragic.\n\nMore Coverage: WGN’s Medical Watch\n\n“I have a history of having migraines with aura,” Hasley said. “So initially I thought, ‘OK, this is going to be a migraine, let me go lay down and try to sleep and nap it off.'”\n\nThankfully, she didn’t.\n\n“As I was laying there, my coordination started to feel a little bit off,” she said.\n\nHasley’s mother drove her to the emergency room, where an initial brain scan appeared normal.\n\n“I was still sitting in the room with my mom when she started to notice that my words started to sound like they were slurring, and at this point, I started to lose feeling in the right side of my body a little bit,” Hasley said.\n\nUnbeknownst to the 22-year-old, Hasley was having a stroke.\n\nDr. Mohammad Anadani works with Endeavor Health Neurologist.\n\n“We see the contrast is the black, and then it stops here, and that is where the blood stops also, so that’s where the clot was,” Anadani said. “This is what we call the basilar artery. It’s one of the most important; we cannot survive without this artery.”\n\nDr. Mohammad Anadani said that he would treat about one young patient a year. Now, “In the last year, I treated two, and just in the last month, I treated two in their 20s and 30s.”\n\nThe signs and symptoms are often the same in elderly and young patients. Doctors caution those who may be at risk to remember the acronym “FAST” to help spot a stroke. Look for asymmetry in the face; arm, or leg weakness; slurred speech; and call 911 immediately, as time is critical.\n\n“Every minute we’re waiting, it’s more brain damage,” Anadani said.\n\nIn Hasley’s case, Dr. Anadani used a catheter to pull the clot out and restore blood flow.\n\n“All these branches or arteries that were not getting blood are now getting blood,” he said. “What can cause stroke in the elderly can also cause stroke in younger people, but younger people do have some unique risk factors like migraine, oral contraceptives, or even pregnancy.”\n\nHasley had another risk factor unique to younger patients – an undiagnosed hole in her heart that allowed the clot to travel to her brain.\n\n“When she initially had the symptoms, she didn’t think stroke first, but then eventually she thought of stroke,” Anadani said.\n\nBut Hasley says her first instinct was hesitancy.\n\n“I didn’t want to be dramatic or get there, and they tell me that I was just having a migraine and send me home,” she said. “But I think it’s important you know your body and have to listen to it.”\n\nIf you have a family history of stroke, let your doctor know so you can undergo proper screening.\n\nSign up for ourMedical Watch newsletter.This daily update includes important information from WGN’s Dina Bair and the Med Watch team, including, the latest updates from health organizations, in-depth reporting on advancements in medical technology and treatments, as well as personal features related to people in the medical field.Sign up here.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Arizona cuts ties with Kane County ambulance services leaving large part of Northern Arizona without coverage",
    "News_text":"FREDONIA, Arizona (ABC4) — After 40 years of serving northern Arizona communities, Kane County Hospital has been asked to end all ambulance services in the state — that includes parts of the Grand Canyon.\n\nSince 1989, Kane County Hospital has assumed responsibility for ambulance operations for a large area in northern Arizona that includes Fredonia, Jacobs Lake, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Now, the state of Arizona is asking Kane County Hospital to stop all transports within its borders.\n\nUPDATE: Fredonia declares state of emergency due to Kane County Hospital EMS loss\n\nAccording to Kane County Hospital CEO, Kurt Loveless, the hospital received a Notice of Investigation after the complaint was filed. He says it was related to “alleged illegal transport of patients” from Banner Page Hospital. The notice also said ambulance operations without a Certificate of Need (CON) is illegal in the State of Arizona.\n\nLoveless, says his team has repeatedly applied for documentation since 2022, but have repeatedly been denied the necessary certificate. Jeff Mosdell, board chair with Kane County Hospital, says all of the hospital’s EMTs are licensed and certified to operate in Arizona.\n\n“A complaint was filed by Page Fire Department after our ambulance transported a patient from Banner Page Hospital,” Loveless told ABC4. “We have been [responding] for 40 years.”\n\nIn a statement to ABC4.com, The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) said all ground ambulances operating in the State of Arizona are required to be registered with them. They add that they have been working with Kane County Hospital on a CON application submitted to allow them to legally operate an ambulance service within Arizona.\n\n“Kane County Hospital has been notified and they have the ability to continue working with the Department once they address the items within their initial application that remained deficient through the application process,” an ADHS spokesperson told ABC4.com.\n\nNearly 100 residents of Fredonia gathered at the city’s offices in an emergency town hall meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss the risks they may face since the change. City leadership presided over the meeting.\n\nDuring the town hall, several residents voiced their concerns about the removal of coverage.\n\n“It’s all because of an interpretation of a law,” Mosdell, said during the town hall Thursday.\n\n“This is one of those times when we understand what it means to be a community,” said Paiute Tribe Chair Roland Maldonado during the meeting. “It’s not just us, but all those communities that will be affected.”\n\nADHS said there are two neighboring CON providers that are able to provide services to the Fredonia area: the Colorado City Fire Department and the Page Fire Department. Directly south is Guardian Ambulance Service, also known as Flagstaff Medical Center who can also provide ambulance services.\n\nKane County Hospital said in a statement that Page Fire Department has a strict rule to not travel outside of the city of Page, leaving the only other ambulance service to be an all-volunteer department in Colorado City.\n\nABC4 reached out to Page Fire Department for a comment but has not received a response.\n\n“No one has been willing to cover this particular part of Arizona, yet we have been denied the CON and now are being investigated for helping Arizona with ambulance transports,” Kane County Hospital’s statement reads.\n\nLoveless told ABC4 that one Arizona Department of Health Services official, Noreen Adlin, has since threatened civil action if the hospital continues to transport patients. “We asked if she realized the impact this would have on the citizens of Fredonia… she said, ‘I’m aware.'”\n\nAccording to ADHS, an out-of-state ambulance service can provide transport services to Arizona residents under two exceptions:\n\nIf they are responding to a major catastrophe or emergency in the state because there are insufficient registered ambulances to respond in that situation.\n\nThe provider is operating either from a location outside of Arizona to transport a patient to a location within Arizona or operating from a location outside of Arizona and crossing through Arizona to transport a patient to a location outside Arizona.\n\nThe hospital says it will continue to pursue receiving permission to operate in Arizona. “As soon as we are allowed to operate in the State of Arizona, we will resume our ambulance services to our Friends and Neighbors to the South.”\n\nMosdell says the hospital’s resolution going forward is to receive communication with the state about what needs to be done to allow their ambulances to once again enter Arizona.\n\nJoseph DeGolyer contributed to this reporting.\n\nCrash causing ‘heavy delays’ on I-80, UDOT says\n\nTexas floods: Death toll nears 70, 11 girls remain missing from camp\n\nShane van Gisbergen wins Xfinity Series race, Cup Series pole in downtown Chicago\n\n‘9th Street Fire’ 85% contained, evacuations lifted\n\nOgden Canyon Fire prompts evacuations in Weber County\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America",
    "News_text":"Rosie Brown, executive director at East Carroll Community Action Agency in Lake Providence, La., said many people in the Delta struggle to make ends meet. Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for the town. Now, she said, President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill could snatch it away. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nLAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.\n\nMayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”\n\n“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”\n\nNow, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according tostate data, despite it having thehighest poverty ratein the U.S. that year.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause11.8 million more Americansto become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.\n\nRepublicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.\n\nThe Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — wherealmost half of the statedepended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade,accordingto KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.\n\nResidents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.\n\n“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.\n\nMedicaid work requirements and other health care provisions in the bill ignore the reality of living in poorer rural communities, where people struggle to find the jobs, transportation and internet access required to meet the rules, according to interviews with people and providers in the Delta region.\n\nEven though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.\n\nOn a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.\n\n“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.\n\nErvin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.\n\nErvin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.\n\nIn East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of peoplelive below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times thenational poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.\n\nExpansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.\n\n“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.\n\nIt’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate inWashington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nGreenville, the county seat, isamong the fastest-shrinkingcities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.\n\nGreenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.\n\nThe result was a trip to the emergency room and a $2,500 bill she couldn’t cover. Right after giving birth, McNair looked for work. She said potential employers often told her that she was overqualified because she had a master’s degree.\n\n“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”\n\nMcNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.\n\n“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.\n\n“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”\n\nMississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.\n\nDelta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.\n\nIt was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.\n\nBut it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, thewhite-ownedBolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”\n\nThe situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.\n\nPeople who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.\n\nBlack residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.\n\nA2001 reportfrom the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”\n\n“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.\n\nEven some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.\n\n“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”\n\nRichardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.\n\n“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.\n\nThat’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.\n\n“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”\n\nIn Mississippi, 20 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closure, according to a recentreport, more than double the number at risk in Louisiana. In many cases, Medicaid is the largest and most reliable payer for rural hospitals. While Louisiana’s overall uninsured rate plummeted to 8.3% by 2023, inMississippiit was 10.5%.\n\n“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had thesame levelof closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.\n\n“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”\n\nNow, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.\n\nIn East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.\n\nAmerica doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.\n\n– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System\n\nBrown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.\n\n“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”\n\nLocal infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.\n\n“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.\n\nDominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.\n\n“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.\n\nEven a job in local government in Lake Providence doesn’t offer affordable health insurance.\n\nNevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.\n\n“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.\n\nAt the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.\n\n“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”\n\nWhile leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.\n\nMorris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.\n\n“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”\n\nMorris is worried about the looming Medicaid cuts. She qualifies for Mississippi Medicaid because her condition counts as a disability, and she depends on the coverage to afford her medications.\n\nMorris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.\n\nBut Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.\n\nMississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.\n\n“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.\n\nLeonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.\n\n“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.\n\n“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”\n\nNational researchersestimatethat up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.\n\nBut national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while2023 census datashow 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid,state health datareviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.\n\nExperts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.\n\nState Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.\n\nDepending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippicould losehundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.\n\n“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.\n\nLast week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed astatementcalling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”\n\nFrom her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.\n\nNewton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.\n\nNewton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”\n\nIn 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults inEast Carroll Parishwas nearly35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.\n\n“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”\n\nRepublican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according toKFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.\n\nBrian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”\n\nMedicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”\n\nBut advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access isnotoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well aspaperwork errors— not because they weren’t working enough.\n\n“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nDatashows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.\n\nPeople in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.\n\n“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”\n\nLake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.\n\nRecentestimatesshow up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.\n\n“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”\n\nThis story is part of“Uninsured in America,”a project led by Public Health Watch that focuses on life in America’s health coverage gap and the 10 states that haven’t expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStateline reporter Shalina Chatlani can be reached atschatlani@stateline.org.

    "News_title":"An ambitious vision of a city built from lava",
    "News_text":"Erupting from fiery volcanoes, lava has historically been an uncontrollable force that destroys buildings and neighborhoods in its wake. But what if that force could instead be redirected and harnessed to create whole cities? An ambitious project from Icelandic firm s.ap arkitektar, presented at this year’s Venice Architecture Biennale (running until November 23), proposes just that.\n\nWhereas lava naturally cools on the landscape to become volcanic rock such as basalt, “Lavaforming” — which envisions molten rock as a new form of building material — lays out strategies for cooling it in controlled ways so that it can set into walls, columns and other architectural elements capable of producing new settlements. Along with collaborators, s.ap arkitektar has made a film imagining the year 2150, when such building technology could become a reality, reshaping the world in the process.\n\nFounded by Arnhildur Pálmadóttir and operated with her son Arnar Skarphéðinsson, s.ap arkitektar has been undertaking research and conducting tests to explore how something that is seen primarily as a threat can be transformed into a renewable resource capable of producing sustainable buildings. But just how realistic is the future of lava cities?\n\nIceland is one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, situated on a rift between two tectonic plates. Home to around 30 volcano systems, the country on average experiences an eruption every five years. It was during one such occurrence — the 2014 Holuhraun eruption — that Pálmadóttir realized there was a “huge amount of material coming up from the ground,” she explained over video call from the capital Reykjavík. She thought: “wow, we could build a whole city in one week with that.”\n\nThe “Lavaforming” project started in earnest a few years later as a “thought experiment,” added Skarphéðinsson. It also aimed to be a critique of the building industry’s reliance on concrete and the carbon emissions resulting from its production. (It is estimated that due to heating lime and clay at high temperatures to create cement, a key ingredient of concrete, the material’s production accounts for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions, which contribute to global warming and climate degradation.)\n\n“We think that lava can compete with concrete, but be more sustainable,” said Pálmadóttir, adding that lava “has all the materialities that concrete has, depending on how it cools down.” If lava cools quickly, explained Pálmadóttir, it turns into a hard, glass-like material — obsidian. If it cools slowly, it is more likely to crystallize, which can work well for creating columns and structural elements. If the lava cools quickly and also gets air in it, meanwhile, a pumice-like, highly insulative material is created.\n\nThe carbon emitted by hot lava spewing from a volcano would be released into the atmosphere anyway, she said, no matter how it is cooled and used — so better to make the most of it and avoid additional emissions from concrete production.\n\ns.ap arkitektar has put forward three speculative methods for turning lava into architecture.\n\nIn the first, carefully designed networks of trenches are dug at the foot of active volcanoes for molten lava from eruptions to be directed into, where it can cool to create structural walls or foundations for a city; such trenches could also channel lava into a factory that molds the lava into bricks that can be moved and used elsewhere. The hope is that by redirecting the lava into trenches, surrounding communities would also be protected from the damaging force of the lava during an eruption.\n\nThe second method harnesses the technology of 3D printing, imagining future 3D-printing robots which could traverse a landscape of molten lava after an eruption and use the lava to “print” elements of buildings. The technology for such robots does not yet exist, however.\n\nThe third technique involves tapping into magma under the ground, directing lava into new, specially constructed chambers where it could cool into prefabricated, replicable architectural elements. The team believes accessing such subterranean magma would take a similar approach to that of geothermal energy production — which harnesses heat from the Earth’s core and is a significant source of energy in Iceland. Though, s.ap arkitektar do not yet know if such a process would be geologically safe.\n\nThe architects concede that the practicalities of “Lavaforming” are not yet fully worked out and relies on further research and technological development, not to mention wider buy-in. But they feel their proposal is becoming more realistic as the project evolves. Since the project’s launch in 2022, s.ap arkitektar have increasingly engaged with scientists, who have worked on lava flow prediction models and visualized them in 3D software, making lava flow simulations for eruptions in Iceland and undertaking “lava tests” in which volcanic rock is heated to become molten lava again, and cooled in controlled ways to make prototype building elements.\n\nRelying on eruptions anchors the proposal to time and place, but s.ap believes its idea could have value in volcanically active Iceland, as well as other locations where there is “slow-flowing lava,” said Pálmadóttir, adding that Hawaii is “really similar” to Iceland geologically, as are the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nVolcanic rock is not a new building material — it has been used throughout time, like stone, for structural elements such as walls. It can be found all over the world, and once quarried, is used as stackable rocks, bricks, panels, or crushed into gravel to be used as aggregate in concrete.\n\nBasalt, the most common volcanic rock, has been used to build structures including the 13th-century Qasr al-Azraq (“Blue Fortress”) in Jordan, the 15th-century Château d’Anjony in France, the Gateway of India (1924) in Mumbai, and the Herzog & de Meuron-designed Dominus Winery (1997) in Napa Valley, California. More recently, basalt was used in the Nashan Geological Museum (2021) in Yangzhou, China, the Radisson Resort & Spa (2023) in Lonavala, India, and an impressive private home called Casa Basaltica (2023) in Querétaro, Mexico. Architects appreciate the material for its strength, durability, insulating properties, rugged texture and often dark tones.\n\nThe way s.ap wants to use volcanic rock, however, is very different — and relies on working with it in its molten state. The practice wants to harness lava as a “mono material,” cooling it in controlled and varied ways — which has “never been done before,” said Skarphéðinsson — to achieve different material qualities within one single form, from solid blocks to pumice-like insulative stone and glass-like sheets for windows.\n\nMuch of s.ap’s inspiration stems from nature, which, as Pálmadóttir said, “has been creating forms and structures out of lava from the beginning of time.” She references the caves formed by bubbles in lava after an 18th-century eruption on the island of Lanzarote (part of the Canary Islands), which 20th-century architect César Manrique used as subterranean rooms for his own home in 1968.\n\nWhether we end up living in cities made of lava relies on complicated practical factors, from technology and safety to funding and political appetite. But for now, s.ap’s vision is simply to make people think a little differently. “How can we change systems to respond to the global (climate) emergency?” asked Pálmadóttir. “How does architecture and the built environment need to address this differently? We hope other places will look at this project as an inspiration.”\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Takeaways: US military expands enforcement zone to 1\/3 of southern border",
    "News_text":"COLUMBUS, N.M. (AP) — The military is expanding its authority and reach along swaths of the southern U.S. border where troops have been empowered to detain people who enter the country illegally.\n\nDesignated militarized zoneswill soon cover nearly one-third of the U.S. border with Mexico under supervision of nearby military bases. Federal prosecutors have filedcriminal trespassing charges in the militarized terrainagainst more than 1,400 people, adding to possible consequences for people who cross the border illegally.\n\nReaction to the military buffer has been mixed among residents of New Mexico’s rural Luna County, where a strong culture of individual liberty is tempered by the desire to tame networks that ferry migrants and contraband across the border.\n\nSome farmers and ranchers have welcomed the military's expanded mission. But the changes also are being challenged in court and questioned by civil rights advocates and outdoor enthusiasts including hunters and hikers who fear they'll be locked out of public lands.\n\nNo-entry signs\n\nThe first two militarized zones, introduced in April and May, extend along 230 miles (370 kilometers) of border. The buffer runs from Fort Hancock, Texas, through El Paso and westward past factories and cattle yards to partially encircle the New Mexico border village of Columbus, where in 1916 Mexican revolutionary forces led by Pancho Villa crossed into the U.S. in a deadly predawn raid.\n\nThe Army has posted thousands of no-entry signs across the region, declaring a “restricted area by authority of the commander.”\n\nJames Johnson, a fourth-generation local farmer, oversees the summer harvests on private farmland along 5 miles (8 kilometers) of the border.\n\nHe says the military deployments under prior presidents put “eyes and ears” on the border and that the new approach is “trying to give some teeth” to enforcement.\n\nLuna County Commissioner Ray Trejo says he and other hunters are worried about their rights to carry firearms and harvest game from the newly designated militarized zones. He sees the new trespassing charges as inhumane in an economy built on immigrant farm labor.\n\n“People are coming into our country to work, stepping now all of a sudden into a military zone, and they have no idea,” he said.\n\nAbbey Carpenter leads a search-and-rescue group for missing migrants and says public access is being denied acrosssweltering stretches of desert where migrant deaths have surged.\n\n“Maybe there are more deaths, but we don’t know,” she said.\n\nFewer border crossings\n\nBorder Patrol arrests along the southern border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since 1966, including a 30% drop in June.\n\nOn June 28, the Border Patrol made only 137 arrests, a stark contrast with late 2023 when arrests topped 10,000 on the busiest days.\n\nThwarted attempts to cross have plunged not only sinceTrumptook office but also previously when President Joe Biden introduced severe asylum restrictions in June 2024, and when Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders in December 2023.\n\nAt least 7,600 members of the armed forces have vastly expanded the U.S. government presence on the border.\n\nThe Defense Department last week addedan additional 250-mile (400-kilometer) militarized area in Texas’ Rio Grande Valleyand plans another near Yuma, Arizona. Combined, the four zones will cover nearly one-third of the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nThe new militarized zones aretied to President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergencyon the border on his first day in office this year.\n\nThe moves are being challenged in proceedings at a federal courthouse in Las Cruces on the banks of the Upper Rio Grande, with mixed outcomes.\n\nMigrants in drab county jail jumpsuits and chains filed before a magistrate judge on a recent weekday. They included a 29-year-old woman from Guatemala who sells pottery for a living. Military trespassing charges against her were dismissed for lack of evidence, but a conviction for illegal entry resulted in a two-week jail sentence before likely deportation.\n\nIn separate proceedings, a federal public defender's office has challenged the military’s new oversight of public land at the border in New Mexico — an area nearly twice the size of Washington, D.C., — seizing on the arrest of one Mexican man for trespassing through remote terrain to test the legal waters.\n\nIt says the designation of a militarized zone in New Mexico without congressional authorization is “a matter of staggering and unprecedented political significance.” A judge has yet to rule on the arguments.",

    "News_text":"COLUMBUS, N.M. (AP) — Orange no-entry signs posted by the U.S. military in English and Spanish dot the New Mexico desert, where a border wall cuts past onion fields and parched ranches with tufts of tall grass growing amidst wiry brush and yucca trees.\n\nThe Army has posted thousands of the warnings in New Mexico and western Texas, declaring a “restricted area by authority of the commander.” It’s partof a major shiftthat has thrust the military into border enforcement with Mexico like never before.\n\nThe move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops todetain people who enter the country illegallyand sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of thenational emergency on the borderdeclared by PresidentDonald Trumpon his first day in office.\n\nU.S. authorities saythe zonesare needed to close gaps in border enforcement and help in the wider fight against human smuggling networks and brutal drug cartels.\n\nThe militarization is being challenged in court, and has been criticized by civil rights advocates, humanitarian aid groups and outdoor enthusiasts who object to being blocked from public lands while troops have free rein.\n\nAbbey Carpenter, a leader of a search-and-rescue group for missing migrants, said public access is being denied across sweltering stretches of desertwhere migrant deaths have surged.\n\n“Maybe there are more deaths, but we don’t know,\" she said.\n\nMilitary expansion\n\nTwo militarized zones form a buffer along 230 miles (370 kilometers) of border, from Fort Hancock, Texas, through El Paso and westward across vast New Mexico ranchlands.\n\nThe Defense Department added an additional 250-mile (400-kilometer) zone last week in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and plans another near Yuma, Arizona. Combined, the zones will cover nearly one-third of the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nThey are patrolled by at least 7,600 members of the armed forces, vastly expanding the U.S. government presence on the border.\n\nReaction to the military buffer has been mixed among residents of New Mexico's rural Luna County, where a strong culture of individual liberty is tempered by the desire to squelch networks bringing migrants and contraband across the border.\n\n“We as a family have always been very supportive of the mission, and very supportive of border security,” said James Johnson, a fourth-generation farmer overseeing seasonal laborers as they filled giant plastic crates with onions, earning $22 per container.\n\nMilitary deployments under prior presidents put “eyes and ears” on the border, Johnson said. This version is “trying to give some teeth.”\n\nBut some hunters and hikers fear they’re being locked out of a rugged and cherished landscape.\n\n“I don’t want to go down there with my hunting rifle and all of a sudden somebody rolls up on me and says that I’m in a military zone,” said Ray Trejo, a coordinator for the New Mexico Wildlife Federation and a Luna County commissioner. “I don’t know if these folks have been taught to deescalate situations.”\n\nA former public school teacher of English as a second language, Trejo said military trespassing charges seem inhumane in an economy built on immigrant farm labor.\n\n“If the Army, Border Patrol, law enforcement in general are detaining people for reasons of transporting, of human smuggling, I don’t have a problem,” he said. “But people are coming into our country to work, stepping now all of a sudden into a military zone, and they have no idea.”\n\nNicole Wieman, an Army command spokesperson, said the Army is negotiating possible public access for recreation and hunting, and will honor private rights to grazing and mining.\n\nIncreased punishment\n\nMore than 1,400 migrants have been chargedwith trespassing on military territory, facing a possible 18-month prison sentence for a first offense. That’s on top of an illegal entry charge that brings up to six months in custody. After that, most are turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for likely deportation. There have been no apparent arrests of U.S. citizens.\n\nAt a federal courthouse in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on the banks of the Upper Rio Grande, migrants in drab county jail jumpsuits and chains filed before a magistrate judge on a recent weekday.\n\nA 29-year-old Guatemalan woman struggled to understand instructions through a Spanish interpreter as she pleaded guilty to illegal entry. A judge set aside military trespassing charges for lack of evidence, but sentenced her to two weeks in jail before being transferred for likely deportation.\n\n“She sells pottery, she’s a very simple woman with a sixth-grade education,” a public defense attorney told the judge. “She told me she’s going back and she’s going to stay there.”\n\nBorder crossings\n\nBorder Patrol arrests along the southern border this year have dropped to the lowest level in six decades, including a 30% decrease in June from the prior month as attempted crossings dwindle. On June 28, the Border Patrol made only 137 arrests, a stark contrast with late 2023, when arrests topped 10,000 on the busiest days.\n\nThe first militarized zones, introduced in April and May, extend west of El Paso past factories and cattle yards to partially encircle the New Mexico border village of Columbus, and its 1,450 residents. It was here that Mexican revolutionary forces led by Pancho Villa crossed into the U.S. in a deadly 1916 raid.\n\nThese days, a port of entry at Columbus is where hundreds of children with U.S. citizenship cross daily from a bedroom community in Mexico to board public school buses and attend classes nearby.\n\nColumbus Mayor Philip Skinner, a Republican, says he's seen the occasional military vehicle but no evidence of disruption in an area where illegal crossings have been rare.\n\n“We're kind of not tuned in to this national politics,” Skinner said.\n\nOversight is divided between U.S. Army commands in Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Huachuca, Arizona. The militarized zonessidestep the Posse Comitatus Act,an 1878 law that prohibits the military from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.\n\nRussell Johnson, a rancher and former Border Patrol agent, said he welcomes the new militarized zone where his ranch borders Mexico on land leased from the Bureau of Land Management.\n\n“We have seen absolutely almost everything imaginable that can happen on the border, and most of it’s bad,” he said, recalling off-road vehicle chases on his ranch and lifeless bodies recovered by Border Patrol.\n\nIn late April, he said, five armored military vehicles spent several days at a gap in the border wall, where construction was suspended at the outset of the Biden presidency. But, he said, he hasn't seen much of the military in recent weeks.\n\n“The only thing that’s really changed is the little extra signage,” he said. “We’re not seeing the military presence out here like we kind of anticipated.\"\n\nCourt challenges\n\nFederal public defenders have challenged the military's new oversight of public land in New Mexico, seizing on the arrest of a Mexican man for trespassing through remote terrain to test the legal waters.\n\nThey decried the designation of a new military zone without congressional authorization “for the sole purpose of enabling military action on American soil” as \"a matter of staggering and unpreceded political significance.” A judge has not ruled on the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, court challenges to trespassing charges in the militarized zone have met with a mixture of convictions and acquittals at trial.\n\nRyan Ellison, the top federal prosecutor in New Mexico, won trespassing convictions in June against twoimmigrantswho entered a militarized zone again after an initial warning. “There’s not going to be an issue as to whether or not they were on notice,” he told a recent news conference.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union attorney Rebecca Sheff says the federal government is testing a more punitive approach to border enforcement with the new military zones and worries it will be expanded border-wide.\n\n“To the extent the federal government has aspirations to establish a much more hostile military presence along the border, this is a vehicle that they’re pushing on to potentially do so. … And that’s very concerning,” she said.",

    "News_text":"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.\n\nNow, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.\n\n“Our budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it’ll be difficult to keep the doors open,” said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.\n\nIf those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.\n\n“That's a long way for an emergency,” Sherman said. “Some won't make it.”\n\nAlready struggling hospitals would be hit particularly hard\n\nStates and rural health advocacy groups warn thatcutting Medicaid— a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans — would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.\n\nMore than 300 hospitals could beat risk for closureunder the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G.

At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, “it's going to be an emergency.”\n\nDay Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has facedrecent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday — estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years — would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball’s current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that’s even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.\n\n“An emergency means I’m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that’s a problem,\" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.\n\n“You’ve got, I’m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,” he said. “That’s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that’s probably already stretched thin.”\n\nExperts say the bill's $50 billion fund for rural hospitals isn't enough\n\nRural hospitals havelong operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s$4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill,which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs — cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.\n\nBut public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.\n\nCarrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.\n\n“We see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,\" Cochran-McClain said. \"Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer — especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding — is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.”\n\nKentucky is expected to be hit especially hard\n\nAKFF reportshows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund.

    "News_title":"‘What are they hiding?’ Florida lawmakers shut out of Alligator Alcatraz",
    "News_text":"In a surprising and possibly unlawful act, five state legislators were denied entry Thursday into a taxpayer-funded migrant detention center deep in the Everglades, raising questions about what will happen behind the razor-wire fences that are being erected surrounding the controversial facility the state has named Alligator Alcatraz.\n\nArmed only with state law and a growing list of humanitarian concerns, state Senators Shevrin Jones and Carlos Guillermo Smith, along with Representatives Anna V. Eskamani, Angie Nixon and Michele Rayner, arrived at the gates of the facility to conduct what they saw as a legally authorized inspection. What they encountered instead was silence, locked doors and a bureaucratic wall.\n\nThe state’s shifting justification for not letting them in — first a flat denial, then vague “safety concerns” — only fueled suspicions.\n\n“This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” the legislators said in a joint statement. “If the facility is unsafe for elected officials to enter, then how can it possibly be safe for those being detained inside?”\n\nJust hours earlier, Republican officials and even former President Donald Trump had toured the same site without issue. When the lawmakers attempted to speak with Florida Department of Emergency Management officials by phone, the call was abruptly cut off.\n\nNow, with reports of flooding, extreme heat and detainees allegedly being held without due process, legislators say the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis is operating a secretive, $450 million detention network with no oversight— and no regard for the law.\n\nThe state legislators Michele Rayner arrived at the site to conduct what they said was a lawful inspection under Florida Statutes 944.23 and 951.225, which grant legislators access to state-operated detention centers without advance notice. Instead of transparency, they were met with locked gates and silence.\n\nUnder Florida law, members of the Legislature have the clear right to access any state-run detention facility, including prisons and jails, without needing prior approval or notification. That legal mandate was ignored, according to Representative Michele Rayner, a civil rights attorney who represents parts of Pinellas and Hillsborough counties.\n\n“For two hours, we waited. We cited the law. We cited the press release announcing our visit. Still, we were denied,” said Rayner. “They cited ‘safety concerns,’ even though just hours earlier President Trump and GOP lawmakers had toured the very same facility.”\n\nRayner said that when she asked whether she could visit a client being detained inside, she was again refused—contradicting statements made to her moments earlier by Florida Department of Emergency Management officials. When legislators tried to clarify the denial with the agency’s general counsel and legislative affairs director, the call was abruptly disconnected.\n\n“This is America right now,” Rayner said. “And everyone should be concerned.”\n\nThe delegation’s visit came just one day after migrants were transferred into the detention center despite flooding caused by ongoing summer storms. Lawmakers say they’ve received reports of extreme heat, poor infrastructure, and a lack of mosquito protection, conditions they say that may be endangering the health and safety of detainees.\n\n“I was bitten by insects as soon as I got here. My lips started to swell. And I’m outside for just a few minutes,” said Rep. Angie Nixon of Jacksonville. “Imagine what it’s like for the people inside who don’t have bug spray or clean bedding.”\n\nNixon expressed particular concern over reports in the Miami Herald that pregnant womenand childrencould be housed in the facility. “We’re spending $450 million on this while refusing to expand Medicaid and closing public schools in Duval County,” she said. “This is not about public safety—it’s about cruelty as campaign theater.”\n\nSmith did not mince words, calling the site a “makeshift immigrant detainment camp in the middle of the Everglades swamp,” built through no-bid contracts awarded to major Republican campaign donors.\n\n“This isn’t about detaining dangerous criminals,” Smith said. “It’s about detaining housekeepers, cooks, and immigrants who had legal status five minutes ago—until it was stripped away by policy.”\n\nSmith referenced a Miami Herald story that revealed the state may bring pregnant women and children to the site, despite public claims that the facility was intended for “the worst of the worst.” ICE data shows that fewer than 10% of current immigration detainees in Florida have any violent criminal history, and the majority had no prior offenses.\n\n“We’re detaining vulnerable people for political spectacle,” Smith said. “And it’s not a coincidence this facility was unveiled just days after our legislative session ended—avoiding any real oversight.”\n\nJones added that the facility, built with $450 million in state funds, does not qualify for federal support. “The federal government has said this facility is ineligible for grants,” he said. “That means it’s 100% on Florida taxpayers—and it was done without a single committee hearing or floor debate.”\n\nJones emphasized that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers should be concerned. “This is not a partisan issue,” he said. “We have a duty to ensure that state-funded operations uphold basic standards of decency and legality.”\n\nRep. Anna Eskamani from Orlando described the detention center as a “political stunt” orchestrated by DeSantis. “Hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent to build what is essentially a concentration camp,” she said. “This is government by press conference and no-bid contract.”\n\nEskamani said reports indicate that the first detainees arrived without due process, and flooding had already compromised parts of the facility. “We’re here because the people of Florida deserve transparency. What is being hidden behind these walls?”\n\nAll five lawmakers said they plan to pursue legal remedies and initiate legislative inquiries into the construction, contracting, and operation of Alligator Alcatraz.\n\nThey also demanded that the Florida Division of Emergency Management and the governor’s office provide a full accounting of who is detained at the facility, what conditions exist inside, and which companies received contracts—particularly those with political ties to the DeSantis administration.\n\n“This is not over,” said Smith. “We will be back, and we will not stop until we get the answers Floridians deserve.”",
    "Atomic_Facts":"[\"On July 4, 2025, five Florida state legislators, including Senators Shevrin Jones and Carlos Guillermo Smith, were denied entry to the Alligator Alcatraz migrant detention center, despite having the legal right to inspect the facility under Florida Statutes 944.23 and 951.225.\", \"The Alligator Alcatraz detention center, built with $450 million in state funds, is reportedly ineligible for federal support and has been criticized for housing vulnerable populations, including pregnant women and children, without due process.\\n```\"]"

    "News_text":"PULASKI COUNTY, Ark. – This July marks eight years since the mass shooting at the Power Ultra Lounge in Little Rock.\n\nPolice responded to the nightclub on July 1, 2017. Twenty-five people were shot and another three were injured running from the chaos inside.\n\nNightclub Shooting Victim Determined to ‘Keep Moving’ After Being Shot\n\nThe rapper who was performing that night, Ricky Hampton aka ‘Finesse2Tymes’, will be back in Little Rock this weekend for yet another concert.\n\nHe will be performing at the Bada Bing Grille 2 out in Pulaski County.\n\nOn the 8-year anniversary, FOX 16 News’ Jessica Rockwell takes a look back on the nightmare that unfolded in this Little Rock nightclub. What did we learn from the events in 2017? And what measures, if any, are being taken to prevent it from happening again?\n\nThe second you step out of the car, you’re hit with a wave of silence.\n\nIt’s as if a piece of history has been erased.\n\nDoors are locked.\n\nLights are turned off.\n\nAll that remains are the haunting stories of years prior.\n\n“I remember what I saw in the news footage, and what the talk around the town was about it. That was concerning,” said Willie Davis, OK Program Coordinator.\n\nDavis was an officer at the Little Rock Police Department in 2017.\n\nAre Guns in Little Rock Clubs a Problem?\n\nThough he didn’t respond to the shooting, he says the events of that night opened up a bigger conversation in the department and in the community.\n\n“[We were] finding ways to address it, interrupt it, to disrupt it,” Davis said.\n\nIt was all hands on deck.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office created a task force to crack down on repeat gun crime offenders.\n\nLittle Rock officers spent more time checking into nightclub security, and in each one of their cars, officers carried a trauma kit.\n\n“Those kinds of incidents can be traumatic: physically, socially, and psychologically,” Davis said.\n\nDavis works on the side as a coordinator for the OK Program, mentoring young boys.\n\nHe says what happened at the Power Ultra Lounge is a teachable moment about communication and channeling emotion.\n\nDavis says he challenges his students to think before acting.\n\n“Should I or shouldn’t I do this? What do my parents think about this? Could this cause me to lose my life,” Davis said.\n\nSuspect in LR mass shooting never extradited, wanted again\n\nThis weekend, Hampton will be back in Pulaski County, almost 8 years to the day.\n\n“Whether we get 200 or 2,000, we just want a successful event,” said AMS Music Events CEO Alvin Mays.\n\nFOX 16 News spoke with the promoter of this weekend’s event over the phone.\n\nAlvin Mays says he was originally cautious about organizing an event with the rapper but ultimately decided the shooting in 2017 was more about improper security rather than the artist.\n\n“You prepare accordingly for crowd size, you prepare for crowd control and you prepare for life safety,” Mays said.\n\nMays says he has put several protocols in place to ensure a safe event including:\n\nOver 40 security guards in and outside the building\n\nMetal detectors\n\nBag Checks\n\nUniformed and undercover officers on site\n\nTeam to handle emergency response and crowd management\n\n“It’s overkill but you know there is no such thing as overkill when you are protecting people,” Mays said.\n\nThe Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office says it will have increased patrol that evening.\n\nThough the memories of 2017 are hard to relive, Davis says there is something we can learn from it.\n\n“Knowing where you are and what’s going on around you is so extremely important,” Davis said. “If you hear arguing or conversation with loud voices raised, leave.”\n\nA point in time, that can spark change and make a better future.\n\nRapper Faces Federal Complaint in Forrest City Shooting\n\nThe Memphis-based rapper has been at the center of several violent nights.\n\nIn June 2017, Hampton was arrested after threatening to shoot a woman outside a Forrest City nightclub where he was performing.\n\nA week later, 25 people were shot at the Power Ultra Lounge in Little Rock.\n\nIn January 2023, two men started shooting at Hampton’s concert in Knoxville.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Firefighters are working to begin efforts to recoverseven individuals who are “unaccounted for” at the site ofmultiple fireworks explosions that destroyed a pyrotechnics warehousein Esparto, officials said at a news conference Thursday afternoon.\n\nMathew Davis, a spokesperson for the Yolo County Sheriff’s Office, addressed the families of the missing individuals, acknowledging their concerns but saying personnel cannot move forward with the recovery effort until the scene is safe.\n\n“It’s important that we operate safely, carefully and securely and in a dignified manner that respects all involved,” Davis said. “We cannot move forward and risk any more injury to anyone else on this scene.”\n\nEsparto Fire Chief Curtis Lawrence on Wednesday said conditions were too dangerous for crews to search for the missing individuals on scene, calling it a “once-in-a-career incident.”\n\nAt Thursday’s briefing, Lawrence said firefighters had begun “targeted fire suppression efforts” to mitigate the risks of recovery and said the area was “a little bit” safer for responders.\n\nLawrence and Davis did not answer questions from the media or families.\n\nWhile Lawrence could not confirm the number of individuals forced to evacuate, he said more than 150 PG&E customers were affected by power outages from the incident.\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, 89 customers connected to a substation on the 18500 block of County Road 89, roughly two miles east of the fire, remained disconnected, according to data collected by the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nSupervisor Angel Barajas, who represents the western portion of Yolo County including Winters and Esparto, said that the board, along with various agencies, were investigating the incident to see whether proper procedures were followed. Barajas said if protocols were violated, the board would “revise and modify” them to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n“We have trust in our partners and our agencies that the investigation is going to be transparent,” he said. “We want to make sure that it becomes a quick and a timely investigation, but we’re going to leave the subject-matter experts to perform those duties.”\n\nBarajas said the county was providing the families of those unaccounted for with food and hotel vouchers as well as counseling services.\n\n“First and foremost, our priority is the families making sure that they’re comfortable during this investigation and this recovery procedure,” Barajas said.\n\nAt a Wednesday news conference, family members of three of the missing individuals — Jesus Ramos, Jhonny Ramos and Joel “Junior” Melendezconfronted fire officials about their handling of the eventafter Lawrence said firefighters’ next priority was decreasing the evacuation zone, rather than locating the missing individuals.\n\nLawrence later said finding the missing was a “big concern” for the department.\n\n“You guys should be more worried about finding the people first and then worrying about the people when evacuating,” said Syanna Ruiz, the girlfriend of Jesus Ramos. “Those are people who possibly lost their lives because of you guys not doing your job well enough, and because you guys are not taking your job as serious as you guys supposedly do.”\n\nIn a statement, officials at Devastating Pyrotechnics, whose facilities were destroyed in the explosion, offered thoughts to the families of those believed lost in the blast and gratitude to first responders who rushed to the scene.\n\n“Our hearts and thoughts are with those we lost, their families, and everyone impacted in our community,” the statement read. “We are grateful for the swift response of law enforcement and emergency personnel. Our focus will remain on those directly impacted by this tragedy, and we will cooperate fully with the proper authorities in their investigation.”\n\nThe company’s attorney, Douglas Horngrad, offered little else, saying that “while we understand the public’s need for more information about the warehouse facility in Esparto, we cannot provide any further comment at this time.”\n\nNo other officials from the San Francisco-based company have discussed the incident with The Sacramento Bee or responded to repeated inquiries about the inferno.\n\nA State Fire Marshal’s Arson and Bomb Unit has been on scene investigating the incident since Tuesday, but currently has no updates on their investigation, Lawrence said.\n\nQuestions about the investigation sent to officials at the Cal Fire division remained unanswered, too.\n\nAnational Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms response team, which typically assembles for major fire and explosion incidents, was called to the Oakdale incident in Esparto, Cal Fire officials said on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cal Fire spokesperson Jason Clay said the investigation would be “lengthy.”\n\nJulie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, an industry group representing all aspects of the fireworks business, saidexplosions like the Oakdale incident are often human caused.\n\n“Usually when a bad incident happens, there are workers dealing with the product,” Heckman said. “Fireworks do not just ignite on their own.”\n\nThe Office of the State Fire Marshal on Wednesday emphasized that incidents like this are rare due to stringent licensing standards. Still, the agency said its team would investigate whether activities at the site complied with both state and federal regulations.\n\nThe Bee’s Darrell Smith, Daniel Hunt, Jake Goodrick and Sharon Bernstein contributed to this story.",

    "News_text":"California Highway Patrol officers will be out in full force focusing on impaired, aggressive and distracted drivers this weekend during a state Holiday Enforcement Period beginning at 6:01 p.m. Thursday July 3 and continuing to 11:59 p.m. Sunday July 6.\n\nAccording to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a total of 2,653 people were killed in motor vehicle traffic crashes of the Independence Day holiday period from 2019 to 2023. Of those fatalities, 40% of the drivers killed were drunk, the NHTSA said.\n\nThe NHTSA advises motorists that if they plan to drink, plan ahead of time for securing a sober ride home. Even those who have consumed one drink should let a person who has not been drinking take them home. The administration clarifies that a sober person is someone who does not drink, and it does not mean a person who’s had the least to drink.\n\nThose hosting a Fourth of July party can also help people make it home safely by making sure there are plenty of non-alcoholic beverages available for designated drivers, the NHTSA said.\n\nAnd also, If you suspect a guest is impaired, NHTSA suggests taking their keys, arranging a ride home for them but not allowing them to drive a vehicle.\n\nIn California alone, AAA said it expects more than 8.9 million Californians to travel to celebrate the holiday which represents an increase of about 182,000 compared to last year.\n\nOverall, AAA estimates 72.2 million people are expected to travel within the United States from June 28 to July 6, an increase of about 1.7 million domestic travelers compared to the same time last years, and about 7 million more than in 2019. About 61.6 million are expected to do the trek by car.\n\nJohn Treanor, spokesperson for AAA Northern California, said that with that many people hitting the road, motorists should prepare for congestion and delays as well as allowing themselves extra time to reach their destination.\n\n“The three most common things we’re going to be called for are overheated cars, dead batteries and blown tires,” said Treanor.\n\nAAA recommends to have your vehicle inspected before setting out on a road trip. This includes making sure tires are properly inflated, checking the vehicle’s battery level and making sure vehicle fluids are topped off.\n\nDuring the 2024 Independence Day weekend, AAA responded to almost 700,000 emergency roadside assistance calls throughout the country.\n\nTreanor said he recommends leaving for a road trip early in the morning if possible to avoid heavy traffic.\n\nAs July 4 lands on a Friday, Treanor said AAA is seeing a lot of Americans decide to take extra days off or even the entire week. Due to that, Treanor said AAA expects there to be a lot of congestion on the roadways on July 6 as people make their way home from their holiday destinations. Getting an eay start to return home on July 6 could help motorists avoid some of the roadway congestion.",

But Mayor Richard Franks says it was never supposed to happen that way, and he and other officials will work to make it right.\n\nGastonia council approves budget despite mayor accusing councilmembers of not reading it thoroughly\n\n“That was unacceptable.

    "News_text":"Tears streaked the faces of Jhony Ramos Sr. and Mercedes Lemos soon after arriving Thursday afternoon outside of the evacuation zone perimeter butting against Esparto.\n\nAbout a mile south — at a rural corner lot since flattened by Tuesday’s calamitous explosions at a fireworks storage facility — laid the place where their missing sons and grandsons, respectively, were last known to be.\n\n“There is nothing,” Lemos told reporters in Spanish when asked what the family had been told by authorities. “And why? We are all human. They are indifferent. And how can they be? ... We all eat, we all feel and we all need.”\n\nSeven people remain “unaccounted for” after the blast obliterated the facility along with nearby homes and outbuildings.\n\nMeanwhile, a national Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms response team was called to Esparto. The specialized team assembles for major fire and explosives investigations, like the Esparto blaze dubbed the Oakdale Fire, for a nearby road where pyrotechnics were hurled after Tuesday’s first blast.\n\nThe team is made up of ATF special agents, fire investigators and forensic chemists; fire protection and electrical engineers; explosives specialists, intelligence researchers and accelerant-detecting dog teams.\n\nNational Response Teamshave responded to some of the most notable disasters in recent U.S. history, including the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and the September 11, 2001, terror attack on the World Trade Center.\n\nThe rapid response team will assist investigators who have been poring over the explosion site since Tuesday night, Cal Fire officials said in a Wednesday evening update as the search for answers into the blast continues now into a third day in still-unstable conditions.\n\nIn a statement, officials at Devastating Pyrotechnics, whose facilities were destroyed in the explosion, offered thoughts to the families of those believed lost in the blast and gratitude to first responders who rushed to the scene.\n\n“Our hearts and thoughts are with those we lost, their families, and everyone impacted in our community,” the statement read. “We are grateful for the swift response of law enforcement and emergency personnel. Our focus will remain on those directly impacted by this tragedy, and we will cooperate fully with the proper authorities in their investigation.”\n\nThe company’s attorney, Douglas Horngrad, offered little else, saying that “while we understand the public’s need for more information about the warehouse facility in Esparto, we cannot provide any further comment at this time.”\n\nNo other officials from the San Francisco-based company have discussed the incident with The Sacramento Bee or responded to repeated inquiries about the inferno.\n\nThe pain in this rural community in far western Yolo County, about 30 miles west of Sacramento, has intensified as the names and the stories of the missing remain known.\n\nBut family members have said that among them are Jesús and Jhony Ramos Jr., 18 and 22 years old, respectively. Their brother Joel “Junior” Melendez also remains missing.\n\nRamos Sr., who traveled with family from Los Angeles after learning of the explosions, told reporters Thursday that authorities had not given the family more information about their missing relatives. Syanna Ruiz, the 18-year-old girlfriend of Jesús Ramos, had also spoken out on the lack of information about the missing at the end of a news conference Wednesday.\n\n”They were, all three, incredible men who had so much coming for them, that had so much coming their way,” Ruiz told The Bee on Wednesday. “I’m just praying to God that some way, somehow, they’re okay.”\n\nThe family was told by authorities they would hear an update by Saturday.\n\nEsparto Fire Chief Curtis Lawrence at a Wednesday news conference said crews could not go onto the site due to the dangers that remained. Recovering the bodies of the blast victims was a “big concern,” Lawrence said when Ruiz asked what fire crews were doing on that front.\n\nMelendez is the father of an 11-month-old son. His wife, Maria, is expecting their second child, her cousin, Marilly Kepoo-Galicia, said in aGoFundMe appealfor the family.\n\n“This tragic accident has taken so much from so many, and for Maria, it’s shattered her entire world,” Kepoo-Galicia wrote. “What should be a joyful and hopeful time has instead become filled with fear, uncertainty, and heartbreak.”\n\nAuthorities on Thursday said the priority for Esparto and local fire crews was to gain access to the ruined facility so authorities can begin to recover those lost in the disaster and “bolster investigative efforts for the explosion investigation.”\n\nThe pyrotechnics explosions at the fireworks warehouse in the 26400 block of County Road 23 near County Road 86A, about a mile south of Highway 16, was said to have ignited numbers of spot fires in the area. Cal Fire said the Oakdale Fire blackened 78 acres before crews halted forward progress Tuesday night.\n\nMathew Davis, a spokesperson for the Yolo County Sheriff’s Office, addressed the missing individuals’ families at the news conference, acknowledging their concerns but saying personnel cannot move forward with the recovery effort until the scene is safe.\n\n“It’s important that we operate safely, carefully and securely and in a dignified manner that respects all involved,” Davis said. “We cannot move forward and risk any more injury to anyone else on this scene.”\n\nLawrence, the town’s fire chief, said firefighters had begun “targeted fire suppression efforts” to mitigate the risks of recovery and said the area was “a little bit” safer for responders.\n\nThe identities of four others who remained missing were unknown and officials at Thursday’s news conference refused to answer any questions from reporters or the relatives among the scrum.\n\nWhile Lawrence could not confirm the number of individuals that were forced to evacuate, he said more than 150 PG&E customers were affected by power outages relating to the incident. By Thursday afternoon, 89 customers in the area were without power controlled by a substation on the 18500 block of County Road 89, roughly two miles east of the fire, according to data collected by the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nYolo County District 5 Supervisor Angel Barajas said on Thursday that the board, along with various agencies, were investigating the incident to see whether proper procedures were followed. Barajas said if protocols were violated, the board would “revise and modify” them to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n“We have trust in our partners and our agencies that the investigation is going to be transparent,” Barajas said at Thursday’s press conference. “We want to make sure that it becomes a quick and a timely investigation, but we’re going to leave the subject-matter experts to perform those duties.”\n\nBarajas said the county has provided the families of those unaccounted for with food and hotel vouchers as well as counseling services.\n\n“First and foremost, our priority is the families making sure that they’re comfortable during this investigation and this recovery procedure,” Barajas said.\n\nFor frustrated loved ones of the missing and authorities alike, questions remain.\n\nWhat triggered the blast?\n\nWere additional materials beside fireworks stored at the site?\n\nDid more than one company store its pyrotechnics there?\n\nPeople near the facility when the explosions took place just about 6 p.m. described a sequence of blasts that rattled buildings and homes in nearby Esparto and was felt by some in Woodland, about 14 miles away. The large blasts, followed by a series of fireworks rattling off from the burning facility, sparked multiple grass fires that firefighters controlled soon after the explosions.\n\n“There are thousands of questions,” Lemos said. “There are no answers.”\n\nExplosions at pyrotechnics facilitiesare extremely rare, Julie Heckman, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association, an industry group, told The Sacramento Bee this week. Human interaction is almost always the culprit, she said, triggering catastrophe.\n\nStorage facilities like the doomed Esparto site must be licensed by both state fire authorities and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Heckman, a member of Cal Fire’s fireworks advisory committee, and must be specially built with materials that do not create sparks or static electricity.\n\nFireworks for Friday’s Independence Day festivities from Marysville to Placerville and the north Bay Area were stored at the Yolo County facility, the blast forcing organizers to reschedule, postpone or cancel their events.\n\nThe Bee’s Sharon Bernstein and Daniel Hunt contributed to this story.",

    "News_title":"Homes burned, 1 dead in Pacoima fireworks explosion 'raining down on neighborhood'",
    "News_text":"With fireworks actively exploding amid an eerie tower of smoke visible from miles away, more than 130 firefighters rushed to put out a major fire Thursday night in Pacoima that engulfed four homes, left one man dead and displaced more than a dozen people.\n\nNeighbors reportedly had to help rescue at least one person through a window in this quiet residential area of 12933 W. Corcoran St., fire authorities said, and one woman was burned so severely that she had to be transported to the hospital in critical condition.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation. Neighbors reported hearing at least one and possibly two massive firework explosions shortly after 9 p.m. on the eve of July 4, before they noticed flames engulfing a nearby house.\n\nVideos captured by neighborsand news helicoptersshowed fireworks actively detonating while crews from the Los Angeles Fire Department fought to contain the blaze from spreading and igniting more homes nearby. The firefighters had to attack the flames in a defensive mode at first, stationing themselves from a safe-enough distance in case of additional explosions.\n\nBy 9:30 p.m., the fire department had declared the blaze a \"major emergency,\" and arson and hazmat teams, as well as the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad, were dispatched to the incident.\n\n\"It is unclear whether the explosion happened first or the fire happened first and caused the explosion, but this fire had obvious fueling,” said LAFD Public Information Officer David Ortiz, who was still working at the scene Friday morning. “Pyrotechnics, fireworks — they were seen exploding and raining down on this neighborhood.\"\n\nRead more:California fireworks explosions: 1 killed in Simi Valley, 2 critically injured in Bay Area\n\nFirefighters were able to knock down the fire at 10 p.m., by which point it had spread to a fourth home, two accessory dwelling units and a car, according to the LAFD. A woman in her mid-30s had to be transported to a hospital in critical condition, and an injured dog was also taken to an emergency veterinary hospital.\n\nOne man was later found dead. Authorities have not released any details about him or the woman who was critically injured, but neighbors said the two were family members.\n\nOne neighbor, Jacob Gonzalez,told NBC-LAthat he had rushed to one of the burning homes, and \"when I arrived, that's when I saw the burn victim.\"\n\n\"She was lying on the floor, crying, her legs were just completely burnt. She was crying out for her husband,\" Gonzalez said. \"I tried to get her some water. I tried to do what I could for her.\"\n\nFour people were also evaluated for smoke inhalation but declined to be taken to the hospital. All told, more than 18 people have been displaced, and four homes had to be red-tagged and deemed uninhabitable.\n\nPolice and fire officials cordoned off the neighborhood through Friday morning and have been searching the area for any additional fireworks that may still be on site.\n\nThe police department's Major Crimes Division is now investigating the death, and the fire department is still investigating the exact cause of the fire. No suspects have been identified, Ortiz said, and there is no one that the police is actively seeking at the moment.\n\nA gas leak has been reported at one of the homes, and the L.A. Department of Water and Power has been asked to manage downed wires along the back of the initial three homes that caught fire.\n\nThe Red Cross and the L.A. Department of Building and Safety have also been tapped to assist in the aftermath of the blaze, and the mayor's crisis response team has been providing grief counseling to the family members of the man who died, and to the families that lost their properties, Ortiz said.\n\n\"It's concerning the number of fires that we are seeing that have involved fireworks in residential zones — the people that are selling these fireworks are not trained to handle fireworks in a safe manner,\" Ortiz said. \"You're dealing with people who are storing fireworks in ways that they're not supposed to be stored.\"\n\nRead more:ATF investigates Northern California fireworks explosion; 7 warehouse workers still missing\n\nIn separate incidents early Thursday morning,a firework detonationkilled one person in a burning Simi Valley garage. In the San Francisco Bay Area town of Hayward, two people were critically injured after a fireworks-related house fire.\n\nIn addition,seven workersremain missing aftera massive explosionTuesday night engulfed a warehouse holding fireworks in Esparto, about 40 miles northwest of Sacramento, and triggered a days-long evacuation for nearby communities.\n\n\"Our hearts and thoughts are with those we lost, their families, and everyone impacted in our community. We are grateful for the swift response of law enforcement and emergency personnel,\" Devastating Pyrotechnics, the pyrotechnics business that operated at the Esparto site,said in a statement. \"Our focus will remain on those directly impacted by this tragedy, and we will cooperate fully with the proper authorities in their investigation.\"\n\nAcross California, fire officials have been bracing for more pyrotechnic-related fires and urging people to report any signs of nonsanctioned firework activity.\n\nLAFD has been releasing messages all week reminding people thatall fireworks are illegalin the city of L.A.\n\n\"If you are storing or considering using fireworks this weekend, we beg you to reconsider and attend a professional show,\" the fire department said in a public service announcement following the fire in Pacoima. \"The most immediate way to render your fireworks inert is to soak them in water.

    "News_title":"Gastonia city manager closes cooling center. Mayor Richard Franks wants answers",
    "News_text":"Gastonia’s mayor and a city council member urged the nixing of the city’s contract with its homelessness agency at a tense emergency meeting Thursday afternoon.\n\nMayor Richard Franks called the meeting after a turbulent week for Gastonia’s unhoused community — one for which Franks argues that the nonprofitHealthNet Gaston, which provides a safety net for the county’s homeless, is responsible.\n\nLocal governments set up cooling centers as a place people without shelter go inside for air conditioning and rest during hot summer months.\n\nBut HealthNet Gaston on Mondayset up a cooling center outdoors, sparking outrage from community advocates, city council members and Franks. It was equipped with two fans, a cooler of water bottles and 10 chairs.\n\nThe city government on Tuesday then moved the cooling center to acity-owned buildingthat was previously home to the Salvation Army.\n\nBut HealthNet Gaston sparked new outrage Wednesday by telling volunteers they were not allowed to use the space due to “safety concerns.”\n\nWard 4 Councilwoman Cheryl Littlejohn, afervent criticof the outdoor cooling center, said volunteers were locked out of the building Wednesday. Though they set up makeshift tents in the parking lot, the volunteers from local churches and nonprofits were told they were trespassing and needed to leave, according to Littlejohn.\n\nThis meant the cooling center, which was slated to be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on all days that reached 90-degree temperatures, was closed both Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n“It made us — as a city of Gastonia, [as] Gaston County — look like we were a bunch of hillbillies,” Franks said.\n\nFranks and Littlejohn cited the outdoor cooling center as proof that HealthNet Gaston was unprepared to care for the city’s homeless population in the heat.\n\n“If six months of planning went into those two fans and a cooler, the planners need to be fired,” Littlejohn said.\n\nBoth Franks and Littlejohn referenced a January city council meeting in which the mayor and council members faced blowback for being unprepared for the cold weather’s impact on unhoused people.\n\nAt January’s meeting, Franks said, he told leadership at HealthNet Gaston that their lack of preparation for the cold was “unacceptable” and could not be repeated.\n\n“People aren’t doing their jobs [yet] they get paid out of our budget to be the lead agency,” Franks said. “They have failed the citizens of Gastonia.”\n\nBarbara McMackin, who works at HealthNet Gaston, attended Thursday’s meeting. In a heated exchange with Littlejohn, McMackin stressed that “we had no idea that the building was an option” for the cooling center, which prompted Monday’s outdoor setup.\n\nFranks said he carried out a fire inspection of the former Salvation Army building with Fire Chief Phil Welch on June 27. Though Welch found three small fire code violations, he gave Franks the green light to operate the cooling center in the code-compliant part of the building.\n\nAfter HealthNet Gaston instructed volunteers not to go to the building on Wednesday, Littlejohn double-checked with Welch if they could still operate the cooling center out of it. She brandished the fire inspection report, which read that the building had been cleared June 27, at Thursday’s meeting as she condemned HealthNet Gaston’s approach to the cooling center.\n\n“They said we were good,” Littlejohn said. “How many days did we allow people to suffer? How many days did we allow people to be in harm’s way because of politics?”\n\nFranks acknowledged that volunteers had served homemade food Tuesday, which he said violated the building code. But he emphasized that the city had instructed volunteers not to do so again on Wednesday.\n\nWithout offering specifics, Ward 5 Councilwoman Jennifer Stepp expressed some concerns about the indoor cooling center.\n\nStepp argued that simply following the fire code didn’t make the building “safe,” pointing out that the city did not involve law enforcement when volunteers set up the indoor cooling center Tuesday.\n\n“It’s also our responsibility, as we try to help these people, to make sure we’re doing things by law, by procedure and in a safe way,” Stepp said. “That means to make sure everyone that might come into that building, whether they are a volunteer, a homeless person or a staff member, is safe.”\n\nFranks, Littlejohn and Stepp were the only council members to attend Thursday’s emergency meeting; the other four were absent.\n\nFranks and Littlejohn made digs at their absences, with Franks quipping that the council could not take a vote on the cooling center without the other members present.\n\nStepp stressed that the other council members were working or out of town.\n\n“To say they don’t care is unfair,” she said.\n\nFranks and Littlejohn also critiqued City Manager Michael Peoples, who is on vacation. Littlejohn said that Peoples did not file a letter with the city clerk about leaving town, so he is still officially in charge of the city, which Assistant City Manager Quentin McPhatter confirmed.\n\nAccording to Franks, McPhatter confirmed in a one-on-one conversation that he and Peoples had made the decision about not using the former Salvation Army building for the cooling center. McPhatter echoed Stepp’s argument that the building wasn’t “safe.”\n\nFranks pledged to continue calling an emergency meeting each day until the council reaches an agreement about the cooling center.",

    "News_title":"RAF nuclear jet base protected by 5ft fence",
    "News_text":"Britain’s new nuclear-capable fighter jets will be protected by a 5ft-high fence that could be scaled by saboteurs, The Telegraph can reveal.\n\nFollowing an investigation, The Telegraph found that a number of the Royal Air Force’s most important bases aresusceptible to potential attacksby determined activists and foreign agents.\n\nAmong them are a mooted future home of Britain’s F35 fighters and two bases that were named astargets by soon-to-be proscribed Palestine Actionlast week.At points, the “vulnerable” airstrips are protected by hedges, wooden fences or nothing at all – which insiders admitted was “not perfect”.\n\nThe potential security weaknesses are publicly available using Street View software, which experts said Palestine Action and hostile foreign powers would already have been able to use to assess their weaknesses.\n\nA dossier of findings has been shared with the Ministry of Defence. The Telegraph has also chosen not to name the bases visited or to detail precisely where weaknesses are along their perimeters.\n\nPalestine Action has pledged to raid air bases across the country after demonstratorsmade their way in and out of RAF Brize Norton, in Oxfordshire, last month without being detected.\n\nBut the RAF appears to have made few attempts to strengthen the physical perimeters of its bases since the incursion, in which two military planes were vandalised.\n\nAt bases visited by The Telegraph, patrols were infrequently observed, barbed wire was absent for large distances, and CCTV did not appear to cover their entire perimeters.\n\nMark Francois, the Conservative shadow defence minister, said the RAF needed to rapidly review base security following the “serious revelations”.\n\nHe said: “The MoD has announced a review of security at all military installations, which must be thorough but also conducted at pace. These serious revelations underline just how crucial that security review now is.”\n\nAt one site, the RAF’s main intelligence and surveillance base, a 700-metre section of perimeter near its runway is made up of hedges and metal and wooden fences that only reach 6ft high.\n\nThe area is devoid of barbed wire and offers would-be infiltrators a quick getaway onto the A15.\n\nNearby, another base is protected only by a 6ft-high, garden-style wooden fence for almost 1.5 miles along its north and eastern perimeter.\n\nThe major base is home to RAF Typhoon fighter squadrons.\n\nReporters also visited another site, which will house the latest generation F35 fighter jets.\n\nIt is also under consideration to house new nuclear-capable F35s bought last month. But for one 200-metre stretch of its perimeter, all that stands in the way of would-be infiltrators is a 5ft chain-link fence with no barbed wire.\n\nPerimeters are also vulnerable at two RAF bases named as targets by Palestine Action in a meeting last week that was accessed by the Telegraph.\n\nOne of these was the RAF’s officer training school. The base’s perimeter is relaxed, with one four-mile section consisting of drystone walls, broken wooden fences, hedges or nothing at all.\n\nThe base also has a series of weakly defended emergency access points – two of which are left completely open and one protected by movable metal barricades and a sign that reads: “Keep off”.\n\nThe perimeter of another site named by Palestine Action – much of which is hedgerows – contains three unmanned gate barriers, which are not wide enough to cover their respective gaps in the fence.\n\nNew, 10ft-high black metal fences appear to have recently been installed to replace three other such gate barriers, however.\n\nPalestine Action has claimed these two bases have links to Elbit Systems UK, a military manufacturer that it has repeatedly targeted before.\n\nIt is understood that the two bases are used for cadet and basic flying training.\n\nEd Arnold, a former British Army officer who was previously in charge of security at a UK base, said the RAF had left itself “vulnerable” to infiltration by activists and foreign agents.\n\nMr Arnold, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: “Palestine Action has shown just how vulnerable the bases are.\n\n“If more dangerous actors followed their example, it could be a hand grenade thrown into a plane’s engine – not just red paint.\n\n“Russia and Iran will be watching closely and thinking that they could sabotage these bases too. Palestine Action has revealed how easy it would be and it is certainly a threat we should worry about.”\n\nRichard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, said the RAF was guilty of a “clear failure of leadership”.\n\nHe said: “Our bases need to be made fully secure.”\n\nIt is understood that enhanced measures are in place following the infiltration at Brize Norton and that security at all bases is under review.\n\nFurther “layered” security measures are also in place inside the bases and other non-visible security measures being used include electronic motion sensors.\n\nSources also said there were air safety limits on the height of fences that can be erected immediately next to runways.\n\nThe majority of the five bases’ perimeters consist of barbed wire-topped metal fencing and main gates are guarded by uniformed personnel.\n\nFrequent patrols are conducted by the RAF, police and dog units, and signs warn people to keep out.\n\nThe MoD said: “We take security extremely seriously and operate a multi-layered approach to protect our sites, including fencing, patrols and CCTV monitoring.\n\n“Following the security incident at RAF Brize Norton, we are urgently reviewing security procedures across the Defence estate and have immediately implemented a series of enhanced security measures at all sites.\n\n“After years of hollowing out and underfunding of the Armed Forces, the Strategic Defence Review concluded that we need to invest more in this area, backed by the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Fourth of July 2025: Where to see fireworks in the Inland Northwest and how to stay safe",
    "News_text":"Jul. 3—Independence Day is here, meaning parades, hot dogs and, of course, fireworks are in your near future.\n\nBut be careful — pyrotechnics aren't to be messed with. If you're curious as to how and where you can celebrate with fireworks in the Inland Northwest, here are the rules and revelries for July Fourth that you need to know.\n\nFirework safety\n\nAll individual consumer fireworks, including sparklers, are illegal in the cities of Spokane, Spokane Valley, Liberty Lake, Millwood, Cheney and unincorporated areas in Spokane County.\n\nThis ban has been in effect for 33 years, and the Spokane Fire Department has the data to back its impacts.\n\nIn the 10 years prior to the ban, they responded to an average of 104 fireworks-caused fires each year between June 28 and July 6. Since the ban was enacted, that number has dropped down to five. Fireworks-caused injuries also fell from an average of 29 to fewer than five.\n\nThe Inland Northwest's hot climate and dry vegetation make the fiery festivities of Independence Day a high risk for residents.\n\n\"Those grasses are really primed for fire to start and move quickly,\" Spokane Fire Department Community Risk Reduction Manager Jamie McIntyre said.\n\nFire marshals from Spokane Valley, the City of Spokane, Spokane County, the City of Cheney, the City of Airway Heights and the city of Deer Park all have enacted a Fire Danger Burn Restriction since Monday.\n\nThe restriction lasts until the foreseeable future and prohibits all recreational fire and open burning. Portable outdoor devices such as fireplaces and barbecues are excluded from the ban and thus allowed, while approved fuels, like firewood, charcoal, natural gas and propane gas, in \"appropriate devices\" also are OK.\n\nIn Deer Park, Airway Heights and Medical Lake, individual fireworks are permitted under certain circumstances.\n\nDeer Park codes permit the discharge of consumer fireworks only on July Fourth from noon to midnight, only on private land. Fireworks can be purchased within the city only from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAirway Heights limits the sales of fireworks from Wednesday at 8 a.m. to Friday at 8 p.m. Consumer fireworks can be used on private land only Friday from 8 a.m. to midnight.\n\nAlthough Medical Lake installed a ban on fireworks last year as it was still recovering from the Gray fire, this year it's lifted. Fireworks are sold within the city from 9 a.m. Tuesday to 8 p.m. on Independence Day. Common fireworks can only be discharged in the city from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday.\n\nFireworks are on sale in Idaho from now until midnight Saturday.\n\nIn Idaho, \"safe and sane\" fireworks, meaning those that stay near the ground and don't travel outside of a 20-foot diameter, can be set off in areas away from vegetation and public property. Although you can purchase aerial fireworks in Idaho, it's illegal to shoot them off in the state.\n\nIf you're looking to get rid of unwanted fireworks, the Spokane Fire Department can't accept them. Instead, bring fireworks to the Waste-to-Energy Plant, 2900 S. Geiger Blvd., for free disposal.\n\nUntil Sunday, you can report nuisance fireworks online atSpokane911.comor call it in to Crime Check at (509) 456-2233.\n\nSpokane Regional Emergency Communications recommends calling 911 if you see smoke from fire at a location, fireworks being aimed or shot at people, people who need medical attention or people setting off fireworks in a dry field.\n\n\"Within the city of Spokane, if you light it, it's considered illegal,\" McIntyre said. \"We are recommending that everybody stick with the professional displays that are available in our region at no cost.\"\n\nFirework celebrations\n\nThere are plenty of festivities to catch if you're looking for July Fourth fun in the Inland Northwest.\n\nRiverfront Park is hosting its annual Fourth of July celebration starting at noon. The band Atari Ferrari plays at 6:30 p.m., and MasterClass Big Band plays at 8 p.m. The celebration culminates with a fireworks display at the Lilac Bowl at 10 .\n\nThe Spokane Indians' game against the Tri-City Dust Devils at Avista Stadium will finish with a fireworks display as well.\n\nIn Liberty Lake, the Fourth of July Concert with \"No. 1 Americana Party band\" Nu Jack City kicks off at 7 p.m. at Pavillion Park.\n\nFor a more modern celebration, Northern Quest Resort & Casino in Airway Heights will be throwing a drone and fireworks show. Doors open at 4 p.m., and the show commences at 10 .\n\nCoeur d'Alene is hosting its American Heroes Parade on July Fourth from 15th Street to Government Way at 10 a.m., followed by a festival in City Park that concludes with a fireworks show at dusk. This year's parade will honor the two battalion chiefs shot and killed in the line of duty in the city on Sunday, according to KXLY.\n\nIf you'd like to celebrate a completely different holiday, the City of Medical Lake is hosting a Christmas in July at the Market on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Jefferson and Lake Streets, complete with Santa and Mrs. Claus.\n\nBonny Matejowsky's work is funded in part by members of the Spokane community via the Community Journalism and Civic Engagement Fund.

After a thorough inspection it was discovered that damaged bearings, located around 130 feet below the ground, caused the supply line failure. The next day, while inspecting the pump, additional damage was discovered on the pump. The city fully removed the pump for repairs.\n\nEphrata Mayor Bruce Reim called for a state of emergency, allowing the city to bypass standard bidding procedures and fix the well in a timelier fashion. The Ephrata City Council will vote on the state of emergency at Thursday night's meeting.\n\n\"The sudden failure of Well Three is an unforeseen circumstance beyond the City's control, creating an emergency condition for the City's citizens. Said failure presents a real, immediate threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the City of Ephrata,\" reads the resolution proposed to the council.\n\nThe resolution, if passed, will allow the city staff to proceed with the required repairs. If not accepted, the repairs will be halted and three will remain out of service.\n\nThe parts needed to repair the damaged bearings were supposed to arrive Friday, according to Harris. However, they were then delayed to Monday and never arrived.\n\n\"We ended up having to get the parts from a different route,\" Harris said. \"It was a different manufacturer that we were able to get those parts from on Monday, after the delays from the other company.\"\n\nHowever, over the weekend, the pump was still able to be fixed.\n\n\"It went really well,\" Harris said. \"The contractor, because we didn't have the parts on Friday to put (the pump) in, they were able to take their time over the weekend and do what they needed to do. They had it completely ready to go by Sunday afternoon. Then they showed up here on Monday morning with it on the truck.\"\n\nThen Monday morning, crews were able to reset the pump and complete the repair process by around 10 p.m. that night.\n\n\"We ran it just a little bit on Monday night, moved the chlorine around and made sure that everything inside of that system was coated good with chlorine and water, and let her sit for the 24 hours Tuesday,\" Harris said.\n\nBacteria and other tests were conducted Tuesday morning and driven by a city employee to Pasco to be examined.\n\n\"As long as we have a negative test, the well will be back on,\" Harris said.",

    "News_title":"Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America",
    "News_text":"Rosie Brown, executive director at East Carroll Community Action Agency in Lake Providence, La., said many people in the Delta struggle to make ends meet. Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for the town. Now, she said, President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill could snatch it away. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani\/Stateline)\n\nLAKE PROVIDENCE, La. — East Carroll Parish sits in the northeastern corner of Louisiana, along the winding Mississippi River. Its seat, Lake Providence, was a thriving agricultural center of the Delta. Now, the town is a shell of its former self. Charred and dilapidated buildings dot the small city center. There are a few gas stations, a handful of restaurants — and little to no industry.\n\nMayor Bobby Amacker, 79, says at one point “you couldn’t even walk down the street” in Lake Providence’s main business district because “there were so many people.”\n\n“It’s gone down tremendously in the last 50 years,” said Amacker, a Democrat. “The town, it looks like it’s drying up. And it’s almost unstoppable, as far as I can tell.”\n\nNow, East Carroll residents stand to lose even more. Like many people in Louisiana, they received a lifeline when the state expanded Medicaid to more low-income adults in 2016. Expansion drove Louisiana’s uninsured rate to the lowest in the Deep South, at 8% in 2023 for working-age adults, according tostate data, despite it having thehighest poverty ratein the U.S. that year.\n\nThis week, the U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill. It includes more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint state-federal health insurance program for poor families and individuals, to help pay for tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich. The legislation would cause11.8 million more Americansto become uninsured by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe bill includes new work rules for Medicaid recipients and would require them to verify their eligibility more frequently. It also would limit a financing strategy that states have used to boost Medicaid payments to hospitals.\n\nRepublicans say enrollees are taking advantage of the Medicaid program and getting benefits when they shouldn’t be. They say the program costs too much and states are not paying their fair share.\n\nThe Delta region, which includes communities in both Louisiana and Mississippi, would suffer under such large cuts. But in Louisiana — wherealmost half of the statedepended on Medicaid in 2023, the Louisiana Department of Health reported — the cuts could be ruinous. Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid support over the next decade,accordingto KFF, a health policy research group. Mississippi, which never expanded Medicaid, could still lose up to $5 billion.\n\nResidents are watching with apprehension, fear and, sometimes, anger, wondering how Congress could be so blind to how much they are struggling.\n\n“If they take that away from us and everyone that really needs it, that’s going to be bad,” said Sherila Ervin, who lives 20 minutes up the road from Lake Providence in Oak Grove and has Medicaid coverage.\n\nEven though Louisiana and Mississippi have taken very different approaches to Medicaid — one expanded eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act and the other didn’t — both rely heavily on the program to sustain access to medical care for all their residents.\n\nOn a hot summer day in June, Ervin walks into the bare-bones 99-cent store in downtown Lake Providence. As she looks over some clothing, she says she’s heard about the potential Medicaid cuts. But she hadn’t heard about the work requirements, and is shocked they’re even on the table.\n\n“I don’t like that. I don’t think they should put a stipulation on that,” Ervin says, exasperated that she would have to report her work hours. It’s hard enough as it is, she says, to thrive in this community.\n\nIn the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles\n\nErvin, 58, has been working at Oak Grove High School in the cafeteria, serving hot plates to children for two decades. She says it’s one of the good, steady jobs available in this area, but her income is only around $1,500 per month.\n\nErvin’s job offers health benefits, but she can’t afford the premiums on her salary. She relies on Medicaid for care, including medications for her high blood pressure.\n\nIn East Carroll Parish, around 46.5% of peoplelive below the poverty level, meaning the area is overwhelmingly poor, at over four times thenational poverty rate, with a median income of $28,321. For Black households, the figure is a mere $16,690.\n\nExpansion was a lifeline for people such as Ervin. Louisiana offers Medicaid to people who earn below 138% of the federal poverty line — currently about $22,000 a year for an individual.\n\n“Sometimes you can work, but then when you work, you still can’t pay to get help,” Ervin said.\n\nIt’s a similar economic situation an hour away across the river. Poverty is about three times the national rate inWashington County, Mississippi, where residents in the city of Greenville lament the consequences of not being able to avoid destructive medical debt, which can keep them stuck in a cycle of gig work and of living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nGreenville, the county seat, isamong the fastest-shrinkingcities in the U.S. It’s still one of the larger rural cities in Mississippi, with coffee shops, restaurants, hotels, a regional hospital and several big-box stores. But the downtown has just a few small businesses and a bank, and residents say jobs are hard to find.\n\nGreenville resident April McNair, 45, remembers giving birth 17 years ago, long before Mississippi extended postpartum Medicaid to a full year. She had Medicaid coverage during pregnancy, but was kicked off shortly after giving birth, despite having post-delivery complications.\n\n“I had to kind of figure out how to make my ends meet,” McNair said. “I ended up with a significant bill, all because I did not have Medicaid.”\n\nMcNair feels like Mississippi leaders are making a mistake by continuing to reject full Medicaid expansion.\n\n“That’s a selfish move. To me, they’re selfish,” McNair said, adding that now she’s worried for neighbors in Louisiana who may lose the lifeline she wishes she had.\n\n“God forbid, hypothetically speaking, what if one of them meets their demise because of this bill that [Congress] passed?”\n\nMississippi experienced its first taste of equalized access to medicine in the late 1960s.\n\nDelta Health Center, the first federally funded health center in the nation, opened during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement in the all-Black town of Mound Bayou, about an hour north of Greenville. The center vowed to care for anyone regardless of race or ability to pay in a region plagued with poverty, poor health and discrimination — and continues to do so to this day.\n\nIt was a significant opportunity for generations of African Americans who had gone without health care, in a place where people had no access to clean drinking water, running sewage systems or even food, said Robin Boyles, chief program planning and development officer at Delta Health Center.\n\nBut it wasn’t easy for the clinic to mobilize support, even though it was clearly needed. Before its opening, it faced pushback from politicians and even doctors. In a 1966 clipping from a local newspaper, thewhite-ownedBolivar Commercial, the editorial board railed against the new clinic, saying it would “lead further to socialized medicine.”\n\nThe situation is certainly better in Mississippi and Louisiana than it was in the 1960s, but critics say the Medicaid cuts could reverse hard-fought progress.\n\nPeople who live in the Delta are fiercely proud of their communities, but conditions there make it hard to thrive.\n\nBlack residents, who are the overwhelming majority, have had a particularly hard time. After the Civil War, many were relegated to sharecropping of cotton and corn for subsistence. Meanwhile, an elite white class of plantation owners and investors amassed enormous amounts of wealth.\n\nA2001 reportfrom the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described the area as one with “limited economic resources; inadequate employment opportunities; insufficient decent, affordable housing; and poor quality public schools.”\n\n“We have a lot of patients that are one health issue away from either being out of a job or being bankrupt because of a trip to the emergency room,” said Dr. Brent Smith, a physician at a primary care clinic at Delta Health System in Greenville.\n\nEven some of the most vulnerable people, such as new moms in Mississippi, still struggle to get basic care, in part because the state has left billions of dollars in federal funding for Medicaid expansion on the table, said Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, an OB-GYN at Delta Health System.\n\n“There are a lot of maternal [care] deserts in Mississippi where women have to travel 60 miles or more just to get prenatal care and just to get to the closest hospital for delivery,” Richardson said. “And I don’t see that getting any better in Mississippi and in rural areas.”\n\nRichardson says nearly all her patients are working moms, many of whom would really benefit from having Medicaid expansion.\n\n“America doesn’t realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own,” she said.\n\nThat’s why Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016, much like the community health center movement in Mississippi, was a bright spot in the rural South, said Smith.\n\n“Louisiana expanded Medicaid, a surprising move in the South to see any state expand,” Smith said. “They saw it for what it was, which was a very real opportunity to assist this specific group of patients.”\n\n“Unlike a lot of our Southern peers, we have not had thesame levelof closures of facilities,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy adviser for Medicaid, with the nonprofit Invest in Louisiana.\n\n“Medicaid was like a real lifeline for people in transition. Oftentimes it was people who had lost their jobs and were just looking to get back on their feet.”\n\nNow, the new work and reporting requirements could put that progress at risk.\n\nAmerica doesn't realize that there are people out here struggling for no reason of their own.\n\n– Dr. Lakeisha Richardson, OB-GYN at Delta Health System\n\nIn East Carroll Parish, finding a job — let alone a good-paying one with health benefits — is difficult, says Rosie Brown, executive director at the East Carroll Community Action Agency, a nonprofit that helps low-income people with their rent and utility bills. Many of the jobs available in town pay minimum wage, just $7.25 an hour.\n\nBrown loves living in Lake Providence; this is where her family is. She doesn’t want to move but wishes the government would invest more in her community — not take away benefits that help people who are hanging on by a thread.\n\n“We have one bank. We have one supermarket,” she said. “Transportation isn’t easy either.”\n\nLocal infrastructure is so limited, she’s even heard of some people charging residents $20 for a ride to Walmart. Some people have to hitch a ride an hour away to go to work, she said.\n\n“There’s nowhere to go,” Brown said.\n\nDominique Jones works at the local library, where she helps roughly 75 to 85 people per month apply for programs such as Medicaid and food assistance. Many of the residents she helps don’t have access to the internet or even a computer, a real barrier for people who’d be required to report their working hours to state Medicaid officials.\n\n“This town right here is made up of a lot of old people that need Medicaid and Medicare. And without it, they wouldn’t have any kind of health care at all,” Mayor Amacker said.\n\nNevada Qualls, 25, sits across from Amacker’s office. She earns just $12 an hour as a cashier at city hall. The low pay means she qualifies for Medicaid expansion coverage, which is good because she can’t afford the premiums for private insurance.\n\n“I feel like there should be a higher threshold for people that can get Medicaid, because they’re still struggling,” she said.\n\nAt the 99-cent store, school district worker Ervin wonders whether state and federal leaders understand what it’s like to live in her community, urging them to visit and see for themselves.\n\n“They want to do stuff for the rich people that’s already rich,” she said. “What are they doing? It’s almost like there’s no common sense with them.”\n\nWhile leaders in the U.S. Senate were working into the night this past weekend debating Trump’s tax and spending bill, Greenville resident Jennifer Morris was praying for the pain to stay away.\n\nMorris, 44, has hemicrania continua, a headache disorder that causes constant pain on one side of her head. There’s no underlying trigger and no cure. Her doctors help her keep the pain to a minimum with regular treatments that include dozens of injections into her head.\n\n“It doesn’t take the pain away,” she said during a late-night gathering in Greenville’s Greater Mount Olivet Missionary Baptist Church in June. “It does reduce the pain so that I’m able to function. But it’s rough.”\n\nMorris’ Medicaid may be safer than that of her Delta neighbors in Lake Providence, as some of the most dramatic Medicaid changes being considered — such as work requirements — target Medicaid expansion states only.\n\nBut Mississippi could be hurt by a provision in the Senate bill that would target a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government.\n\nMississippi could see a major hit to its Medicaid funds, which “would be a tremendous decrease in revenue for the state,” harming “services and access to care,” says Mitchell Adcock, executive director at the Center for Mississippi Health Policy.\n\n“It would be just the opposite of expansion. It would be a contraction for the Medicaid program in the state,” he said.\n\nLeonard Favorite, a pastor who was attending the same event at Mount Olivet Church, as Morris, says he grew up on a plantation in Louisiana and worked his way out of poverty by joining the Air Force. This type of journey is hard, he said, when you’re already starting from so far behind. He thinks the “big, beautiful bill” will create more roadblocks for poor people.\n\nGlaucoma-related vision loss is often preventable, but many can’t afford treatment\n\n“You have people who are already living below the poverty line and they will certainly be submerged into poverty at unspeakable levels,” said Favorite, 70.“ That seems to be the trend of this administration from the point of view of looking from the outside.\n\n“Poor people are beginning to feel the tremble factors of an administration that caters toward the rich.”\n\nNational researchersestimatethat up to 132,000 Louisianans who gained health insurance under expansion could lose it under work rules.\n\nBut national reports that rely on census data likely underestimate the potential Medicaid losses. For example, while2023 census datashow 47% of East Carroll Parish was on Medicaid,state health datareviewed by Stateline and Public Health Watch suggests the number is more like 64%. Similarly statewide, census data showed about a third of Louisianans were on Medicaid. State data shows that percentage is closer to 46.5%.\n\nExperts such as Joan Alker at the Georgetown Center for Children and Families say the undercounts nationally are a well-known issue among researchers, but it’s difficult to correct because the quality of state reporting can be so uneven.\n\nState Medicaid funding is also at risk. For years, both Mississippi and Louisiana have relied on revenue generated through a financing tool — known as a provider tax — to draw down more federal dollars and boost Medicaid reimbursements to providers. But congressional Republicans hope to limit states’ ability to collect those taxes.\n\nDepending on how Congress restricts provider taxes, Mississippicould losehundreds of millions in federal Medicaid funding, crucial in a state with such a high uninsured rate, said Richard Roberson, president and CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.\n\n“It’s unavoidable that when you’re taking that much money out of the system, that there’s not going to be some repercussions felt even in non-Medicaid expansion states like Mississippi,” Roberson said.\n\nLast week, the Louisiana Hospital Association signed astatementcalling the package of Medicaid cuts before Congress “historic in their devastation.”\n\nFrom her small, sunny office in East Carroll Parish, nurse Jennifer Newton can’t understand the attacks on Medicaid.\n\nNewton, who grew up one parish over in West Carroll, is executive director of the Family Medical Clinic, a community health center in Lake Providence and one of the few health providers in town. She says 50% of the clinic’s patients have Medicaid insurance.\n\nNewton has worked in health care in the area for decades and watched as Medicaid expansion made it possible for more patients to access and afford health care they desperately needed, including preventive services. “It’s absolutely helped,” she said. “Absolutely.”\n\nIn 2015, the year before Louisiana expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate among working-age adults inEast Carroll Parishwas nearly35%. By 2021, that number was 12.7%.\n\n“Why are we going back?” Newton asked. “We’ve made so much progress.”\n\nRepublican supporters of work requirements, including Louisiana representative and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue they will encourage people to find jobs and ensure Medicaid goes to people who need it most. But according toKFF, a majority of Louisiana adults with Medicaid — 69% — already work.\n\nBrian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, is not concerned about eligible people losing coverage, as has happened under previous work requirement efforts. He says the bill has built in exceptions for certain people and requirements “can be met by not just work,” so “concerns seem pretty overstated.”\n\nMedicaid recipients also can meet the requirement by volunteering or attending school for 80 hours per month.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand that there are areas in the country where there’s not jobs. There’s always work to be done,” Blase told Stateline. Blase said he believes Medicaid is “the government conditioning welfare for able-bodied working-age adults.”\n\nRepublicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running\n\nBut advocates and experts predict East Carroll, where internet access isnotoriously bad, would experience results similar to when Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018: People disenrolled because of lack of awareness and confusion over the policy, as well aspaperwork errors— not because they weren’t working enough.\n\n“Unless the beneficiary can navigate that red tape, they’re going to lose coverage and become uninsured,” said Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nDatashows Arkansas’ experiment did not increase employment, Sommers said, and instead led to more people reporting medical debt and delaying care because of cost.\n\nPeople in the Delta — where the legacy of government neglect and discrimination are all around — want politicians to visit their towns and see the barriers people face trying to improve their lives and stay healthy.\n\n“People spent their lives uninsured,” said Amy Hale, a nurse practitioner at East Carroll Medical clinic. “Medicaid expansion allowed them to get in here and be treated.”\n\nLake Providence residents are scared they may find themselves in a similar situation as McNair and other people across the river in Greenville: working, uninsured, and too poor to access health care.\n\nRecentestimatesshow up to 317,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid health insurance under Trump’s tax bill. Nearly 33,000 in Mississippi.\n\n“People are actually trying,” McNair said. “I really wish [lawmakers] would look at it from a different lens. What if it was their kid? Or they didn’t have the salaries they have now and your baby is ill. … Like really take a step back and think about what it is that you’re doing.”\n\nThis story is part of“Uninsured in America,”a project led by Public Health Watch that focuses on life in America’s health coverage gap and the 10 states that haven’t expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStateline reporter Shalina Chatlani can be reached atschatlani@stateline.org.

The person was rushed to hospital and remains in serious condition, according to Andrea Quattrocchi, a major in the Carabinieri police force.\n\nThree people were left with severe burns and received treatment from emergency services at the scene.\n\nMassimo Bartoletti, an eyewitness, told Rome’s La Repubblica newspaper: “It looked like hell.\n\n“I saw the first explosion with the classic fireball. Shortly after came the second one which was hellish. A fiery mushroom cloud formed in the sky.

    "News_title":"Idaho college killings: Questions remain after stunning guilty plea",
    "News_text":"Bryan Kohbergerhas been behind bars for nearly 1,000 days. All the while, his lawyers had repeatedly insisted he was innocent.\n\nNow that the criminology student accused of killingfourIdahocollege students has insteadpleaded guiltyin a dramatic turn of events, he will almost certainly spend the rest of his days behind bars.\n\nThe guilty plea and admission to the stabbing deaths -- just weeks from the planned start of his trial -- stunned many, in a case that had ceaselessly gripped headlines.\n\nWhat had been seen as a largely circumstantial case was suddenly crystallizing with every admission that Kohberger made to the judge on Wednesday.\n\nBut many questions remained unanswered. While Kohberger admitted to the killings of Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin -- students at a school mere miles away from his own and with no apparent connection to him -- many of the details remain a mystery, most notably: why he did it.\n\nIt has been nearly three years since the brutal stabbing deaths of Goncalves, Mogen, Kernodle and Chapin. The grisly crimes sent shockwaves rippling through the tight-knit college town of Moscow, and ignited a continuous firestorm across social and news media.\n\nTheir bodies were found in the girls' off-campus house on King Road on Nov. 13, 2022. Near Mogen's body, a KA-BAR knife sheath was discovered. The knife has never been found.\n\nA more than six-week manhunt ensued, and many residents of the cozy college town began locking their doors at night for the first time. Whether the killer had skipped town – or still lurked among them – was anyone's guess. In the vacuum of real information being shared, conspiracy theorists and true crime hobbyists ran amok with false accusations.\n\nThen one day before New Year's Eve, a criminology Ph.D. student at Washington State University was arrested, more than 2,000 miles from where the killings occurred.\n\nKohberger was taken into custody at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, after driving cross-country to spend the holidays with family. He appeared to have no connection to the victims, save for their schools' proximity. And yet, prosecutors alleged, his DNA had been found on the button snap of the knife sheath.\n\nHis phone pinged off cell towers in the King Road home's area the night the killings occurred, they said. His car was caught on surveillance footage taking multiple passes by what would soon become a crime scene, they said. One of two surviving roommates told police she had seen a masked intruder with \"bushy eyebrows\" that night – a description that has become a hallmark of the case and one, prosecutors said, applied to Kohberger, though his lawyers would later dispute that.\n\nAfter Kohberger's arrest, the lawyer representing him in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, said his client was \"eager to be exonerated of these charges.\" The case was largely circumstantial. There was barely any eyewitness testimony. The murder weapon was missing.\n\nKohberger was extradited to Idaho and indicted in May 2023. He was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary. He is now facing four back-to-back life sentences, as outlined in his plea agreement, for the crimes in addition to 10 years for the burglary count. His sentencing hearing has been set for July 23.\n\nEven before Kohberger was named as a suspect, the murder case captured international attention despite – or perhaps fueled in part by – the heavy shroud of secrecy draped around its details. A strict gag order was imposed early on by the judge first overseeing the case that has forced the case to play out largely behind closed doors.\n\nLittle by little though, the shape of the evidence began to emerge. A slow, steady drip of information has trickled from at-times heated hearings and literally thousands of court filings – and hundreds of thousands of pages of briefs.\n\nMORE: Woman who says she saw Bryan Kohberger near murder scene repeated claim at least four times\n\nFor years, Kohberger's lawyers had aggressively accused prosecutors of failing to do their due diligence onother possible leadsand that they were too single-mindedly focused on their client. They have said investigators used a \"false information trail\" to target Kohberger and even suggested that police intentionally misled a judge to get the search warrants they wanted on Kohberger – a very serious allegation that ultimately went nowhere with the judge.\n\nMeanwhile, the defense has levied a litany of legal salvos trying to puncture holes in prosecutors' case, including casting doubt on theDNA evidence, asking to have the indictment dismissed, and fighting repeatedly to get the death penalty taken off the table on a wide range of grounds, pointing to everything from the U.S. Constitution and international human rights to evolving social norms, to his autism spectrum disorder diagnosis as a factor on jurors' perception, to needing more time for the morass of discovery and intensive preparation they must do in such a capital case. All those attempts were unsuccessful.\n\nIf he had been convicted at trial, Kohberger could have faced execution by firing squad. That capital punishment method is newly legal in Idaho because of the ongoing nationwide shortage of the lethal injection drugs, as major pharmaceutical suppliers have withdrawn from the capital punishment market.\n\nWhat all the legal back-in-forth has succeeded in, however, is continuously pushing back the actual trial – to the frustration of some of the victims' families.\n\nBut those delays in the judicial proceedings could not freeze time. The off-campus home where the killings occurred was demolished in December 2023, after the property owner donated the home to the school. The school made the call to tear it down as a \"healing step,\" they said at the time, despite mixed feelings from the victims' families. The sunrise demolition took less than two hours.\n\nThe Goncalves and Kernodle families had pointed to potential evidentiary value in preserving the house, while the parents of Ethan Chapin – whose brother and sister were still students at the university – were supportive of the demolition.\n\nNeither Kohberger's defense nor prosecutors had pushed back on the planned demolition, and the school said it would help stop \"efforts to further sensationalize the crime scene.\"\n\nLawyers for Kohberger have also denounced what they called \"inflammatory\" and \"prejudicial\" media coverage against their client. The trial, once slated to take place in Latah County, where the killings occurred, wasfinally moved to Boiseafter a long legal battle waged by the defense.\n\nEarly one Sunday morning in September 2024, Kohberger was transported by an Idaho State Police plane from the Latah County Jail, where he had been held, to Ada County. In both facilities, Kohberger has been housed by himself, for his own and others' safety, authorities have said.\n\nHis lawyers had said that Kohberger was driving around alone on the night the killings occurred, and the reason his phone stopped reporting from the network in the critical window when the killings occurred is because he was out in a very remote area, stargazing.\n\nIt's an alibi that both judges who have overseen the case summarily scoffed at: Judge John Judge in Moscow, dubbing it a \"so-called\" alibi; Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, saying \"at this point, [Kohberger] has not provided an alibi, partial or otherwise.\"\n\nSome of the search warrants served on Kohberger's online shopping indicated curiosities far earthlier than the cosmos, prosecutors said. Eight months before four Idaho college students would be found stabbed to death, as ABC News has previously reported, the man accused of the bloody killing spree bought a knife that matches what prosecutors said could be the murder weapon. Kohberger's lawyers, while arguing his innocence, had said the whole Kohberger family had access to that Amazon account.\n\nBut it was Kohberger's buy, prosecutors said. \"He purchased online a KA-BAR knife and sheath with an Amazon gift card,\" prosecutor Bill Thompson said at Wednesday's plea hearing.\n\nMORE: Idaho college victims' friends recall moment they responded to home: 'You know something's wrong'\n\nProsecutors also pointed to Kohberger's own writings, including in their court briefs a homework assignment from his master's degree program that they said was essentially a crime scene how-to guide that showed he had been not just a scholar of crime – he knew how to cover his tracks after committing murder.\n\nIt was a point Thompson explicitly made at Wednesday's plea hearing.\n\n\"The defendant has studied crime. In fact, he did a detailed paper on crime scene processing when he was working on his pre doctorate degrees, and he had that knowledge and skill,\" Thompson said.\n\nMeanwhile as the case dragged on, its cost mushroomed. The financial burden has largely been borne by the local community itself. In 2022, Idaho Governor Brad Little had committed up to $1 million in emergency funds to support the manhunt and investigation, which has helped defray some of the expense. The change in venue to Boise would have also brought additional costs as prosecutors and others would have had to travel more than five hours to Boise for what was expected to be a three-month trial.\n\nNow, that trial, where the actual evidence would finally come to light, will never occur. And at least for now, the case comes to a close much like it started: with still-unanswered questions.\n\nABC News' Josh Margolin and Jim Hill contributed to this report.",

    "News_text":"All products featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by Condé Nast Traveler editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, Condé Nast may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nf11photo\/Getty\n\nIt's an unusual time for our national parks. I've seen it first hand. On a sunny spring day in Colorado, I walked downRocky Mountain’sPark Entrance Road with a protest sign as a barrage of car horns honked and drivers cheered in solidarity. Along with roughly 700 other concerned citizens, I spent the afternoon marching and chanting catchphrases like “hands off our parks” and “parks not profits.” The mood was energizing. And though the national parks had been all over the news forbudget cuts and staffing shortages, if you could look past the commotion of the protest, the park’s trails and visitor center seemed… normal.\n\nWhile it’s true that the country’s beloved parks are currently operating with abouthalf of their expected seasonal staffand are bracing formassive budget cutsunder the current administration, it’s also true that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has gone to great lengths to maintain the façade that National Park Service (NPS) sites are doing just fine, even going so far asordering them to stay openwithout enough staff to properly do so. As a result, important scientific research and services are being neglected behind the scenes so that visitors during the busy summer season don’t notice the fallout from the dismantling of the current organization of the NPS. We may notseethe negative effects of NPS cuts for months.\n\n“We sometimes forget (that) managing a place likeYellowstoneorRocky MountainorYosemiteis likerunning a city,” says Michelle Uberuaga, a Senior Program Manager for theNational Parks Conservation Association. “In addition to service and public-facing roles, these skilled Americans perform roles like wastewater management, IT, wildfire prevention, species and ecosystem recovery, and beyond.”\n\nAll products featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by Condé Nast Traveler editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, Condé Nast may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nHow Your National Park Trip Could Change Under Trump\n\nPark advocates say recent staff layoffs and building lease terminations could have far-reaching implications for both the visitor experience and the protection of natural resources.\n\nStill, if you look closely, it’s possible to see the strain already facing top national parks. Carlsbad Caverns hastemporarily suspendedmany of its ranger-guided cave tours. Denali has announced that it’sforgoing its popular youth campsfor the entirety of 2025. Since May 2, the Park Service’s Alaska Regional Office haslost about one-third of its staff, the most of any support facility so far, just as an estimated 2.6 million visitors stream in during the summer high season.\n\n“They're going to have no choice but to reduce services,” says Sheridan Steele, former superintendent ofAcadia National ParkandBlack Canyon of the Gunnison. “That could mean anything from dirty restrooms to emergency calls that are not answered swiftly… That could actually mean health and safety issues for visitors. It could mean fatalities.”\n\nThese effects might be even more glaring when thousands of seasonal park workers leave the NPS in September and October. “Weather and avalanche forecasting are a big concern for winter, and we should expect far less grooming of snow parks and winter recreation areas,” says Tania Lown-Hecht, Vice President of Communications & Strategy at Outdoor Alliance, a conservation nonprofit dedicated to human-powered pursuits, like paddling and mountain biking. “There is also concern about wildfires, particularly in the late summer and early fall, given that a lot of staff that remove invasive species and help minimize wildfire risk have been laid off,” she says.\n\nWith all this in mind, we asked parks experts how visitors can prepare to responsibly—and safely—visit this season.\n\nKnowing your limits is going to be a key element of staying safe in the national parks this year, says Steele, especially with short-staffed rescue teams and visitor centers. “We talk a lot about preventive search and rescue in the national parks. If you can prevent a search and rescue, you've saved somebody from serious injury or maybe saved their life.”\n\nTraditionally, visitor centers are the first line of defense when it comes to alerting visitors about park alerts and safety messages. Steele worries that if there are long vehicle lines to enter a popular park or short-staffed information desks, travelers might skip these important hubs.\n\nAll products featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by Condé Nast Traveler editors.

You Might Need a Reservation\n\nYosemite is bringing back its reservation system this summer. Here's what to know.\n\nOne sentiment that’s been echoed in ongoing news coverage of the NPS staffing cuts is the likelihood that national park restrooms will be cleaned and stocked less frequently than in past years. As such, visitors are being encouraged to pack extra hand sanitizer and toilet paper with them when they enter a park.\n\n“I was at Canyon de Chelly National Monument a couple of months ago,\" says Steele. \"And there was literally a sign in the restroom that said, ‘We are only cleaning restrooms every other day due to staff shortages.'\"\n\n“Once all the bathrooms and all [of] the campgrounds are open, it's nonstop running back and forth,” says Olek Chmura, a fired custodian from Yosemite. “Without me there or other custodians to fill that void, it's gonna be pretty disgusting.” Reports have already started circulating thatscientists are being diverted to restroom clean upduty at some of the country’s most popular parks, like Yosemite.\n\nMy hot take? It’salwaysa good idea to bring extra TP and sanitizer on a national park visit. Popular areas (like Yosemite Valley) are often understocked, especially on weekends, and this year, smaller parks might lack important resources.\n\nAlarmingly, parks have also beenforced to hang guest feedback signsin restrooms and other visitor-facing areas that encourage travelers to report “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.” The National Parks Conservation Association issued a statement detailing their worry that such signs will encourage visitors to “contradict crucial scientific and historical facts.”\n\nSo far, it is unclear how these signs will affect National Historic Sites, like Manzanar and Brown vs. Board of Education, which are specifically designated to educate the public about our country’s long and complicated history of racial tension. Similarly, interpretive signs detailing the forced removal of Native Americans from many of these breathtaking lands could be removed as part of this troubling initiative, even though the NPS has madea concerted effort to tell Native storiesin recent decades.\n\nAll products featured on Condé Nast Traveler are independently selected by Condé Nast Traveler editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, Condé Nast may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nHow Indigenous Tour Operators Are Reclaiming Their Ancestral Ties to National Parks Around the World\n\nFrom Uganda to Montana, the creation of national parks has led to the displacement of Indigenous communities who, today, invite travelers to learn their stories.\n\nFor years, parks have been operating with fewer staff and inadequate budgets, even as visitation soars. “Park staffing has eroded by 20% since 2010, while at the same time parks have experienced a 16% increase in visitation,” says a spokesperson for the National Parks Conservation Association.\n\nThis means that we’ll all need to tread lightly for years to come if we want to minimize negative impacts to the parks that we love so dearly. Before traveling to your favorite national park, brush up on theLeave No Trace Principlesand pack the10 Essentialsinto your car or backpack, to make sure you and your crew stay safe and protect delicate natural ecosystems.\n\nIt’s also a great idea to spread out and explore a less-touristed park this year. Head to the high-altitude Indian Peaks Wilderness instead of Rocky Mountain or the red rock haven of Goblin Valley State Park instead of Bryce Canyon. With top national parks hosting millions of road-tripping travelers every summer, you might actually find a more enjoyable and serene wilderness experience elsewhere. That’s the beauty of America’s public lands—they don’t have to be Instagram-famous to be utterly spellbinding.\n\nOriginally Appeared onCondé Nast Traveler",

    "News_title":"Conservation collaborators’ appeasement chickens come home to roost",
    "News_text":"A clearcut logging project near Helena, Montana (Photo courtesy of Vicki Anfinson, used with permission).\n\nAbout 30 years ago the industry-spawned strategy of “collaboration” entered the policy arena to influence and neuter the “conservation movement” that was dedicated to protecting the rapidly disappearing old growth forests, native species, wild landscapes, and pristine, trout-filled rivers.\n\nThe logging industry had already lost the so-called “timber wars,” having cut themselves out of a sustainable future.  Likewise, the environmental abuses by extractive industries had left Montana with an inordinate number of clearcuts, Superfund sites (including the largest in the nation), abandoned industrial facilities and mines leaking toxins such as cyanide, that required treatment in perpetuity.\n\nIndustry strategists are anything but dumb.  They knew they were losing public support due to their track record of environmental destruction. So they came up with “collaboration,” where extractive industries would find “consensus” with conservationists — virtually guaranteeing they’d get at least half of what they wanted, if not more.  In Montana, that strategy was first implemented by Gov. Marc Racicot’s hand-picked “Consensus Council.”\n\nFormerly, conservation groups had lauded their “grassroots” nature, since members were their primary source of funding.  But that changed as these groups began to receive millions of dollars from foundations that were more inclined to fund collaborators than hard-fighting conservation advocates.\n\nAs vast sums of foundation funding flowed into Montana, formerly small organizations like the Montana Wilderness Association bought multi-million dollar buildings and, rather ironically, as their staff size and “assets” exploded, their actual conservation victories dwindled.\n\nThey were joined by The Nature Conservancy, The Wilderness Society, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, Trout Unlimited, Sierra Club, Mountain Mamas, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, and many others that adopted a “go along to get along” attitude with extractive industries, government land and water management agencies, and special interests as they collaborated to cut the dwindling conservation baby in half again and again and again while hiding behind the charade of supporting “access.”\n\nThey refused to criticize Sen. Jon Tester for tossing science aside to set the horrific precedent of Congressionally delisting wolves from the Endangered Species Act protections using a rider on a defense spending bill.  Why?  Because he was running for re-election.\n\nAs electoral politics crept in to influence dubious policy changes they supported expanding categorical exclusions from bedrock environmental laws that require government agencies to consider the consequences of their proposed actions — and significantly, to provide the public with the right to review, comment and object to those proposals.\n\nThey supported vast “landscape scale” deforestation proposals under highly ambiguous “emergency” declarations.  They lauded the “Good Neighbor Policy,” which allows state governments to determine the management of federal lands.  That resulted in Montana’s Gov. Steve Bullock, perhaps seeking votes for his Senate campaign, to declare a stunning five million acres of national forests needed emergency logging, thinning and burning.\n\nBut now, those appeasement chickens are coming home to roost.\n\nLast week, it was the repeal of the Roadless Rule that protected roadless lands.  This week, the Department of Agriculture issued new regulations that eliminate public notice before using vastly expanded categorical exclusions, eliminate public comments on environmental assessments and Forest Plan revisions while dumping the requirement to publish draft Environmental Impact Statements for public review and allowing the Forest Service to choose which regulations it wants to use for on-going projects.\n\nAs the disastrous policies of the national and state administrations escalate, the collaborators are now trapped in a losing web of their own weaving.  After all, they still have to maintain those expensive buildings and pay those bloated staffs.  To do so they continue to suckle greedily at the foundations’ collaboration teats — all while facetiously claiming they’re “fighting” for conservation of our last wild lands and waters.",

    "News_title":"Ending the Imperial Judiciary",
    "News_text":"On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered a powerful message: The job of the judiciary is to apply the Constitution and laws enacted by the peoples representatives, not to implement a judges political agenda. In delivering this message, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett humiliated ideologue Ketanji Brown Jackson, who declined to engage in legal analysis, because it was (as Jackson put it)\"mind-numbingly technical.\"\n\nIn decision after decision this term, the court restored jurisprudential principles to the judiciarys mission, culminating in repeated rebukes of progressive judges who use the Constitution and federal law as props to advance their political agendas. The era of liberal activist judges that began with Earl Warrens ascension to chief justice in 1953 has officially ended.\n\nThe re-emergence of the Constitution began when the court eschewed \"penumbras\" emanating from the Constitution hallucinated by Justice William O. Douglas inRoe v. Wade, returning abortion decisions to the states. Then, aunanimouscourt stopped Democrats from protecting democracy by depriving voters of the opportunity to vote for Trump. Ending the Biden administrations lawfare, a split court next explained that because the powers of the executive branch are vested in just one person, the president must have immunity to utilize the powers of the office. In other words, the courts are not the presidents boss.\n\nSince January, activist Democrat-appointed judges committed to preserving radical left policies have repeatedly enjoined Trumps orders. Even liberal appeals courts have begun to stay or reverse the most egregious abuses involving tariffs, immigration, and government layoffs.\n\nLast week, after U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer enjoined Trump from federalizing the California National Guard because he disagreed with Trumps prescription for quelling the violence caused by anti-ICE rioters, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit unanimouslyreversed. The panel rejected Breyers right to decide the law, facts, and policy, and reminded him (and 111 other district court judges in the Ninth Circuit) that on matters related to the National Guard, the presidents judgment stands unless it is so extreme as to be dishonest.\n\nDuring the first 20 weeks of Trumps second term, the administration filed 19 emergency applications to the Supreme Court to stop district court judges who substituted their policy judgments for the presidents. In almost all cases, the administration prevailed, at least pending a complete judicial review, preserving its right to deport illegal aliens; permitting DOGE to review government spending and recommend cuts; disqualifying transgender people from military service; and allowing cuts to ideologically driven federal grants.\n\nOn its regular calendar, the Supreme Courtunanimously:held that straight white people have the same rights to be protected from discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as do so-called marginalized minorities; protected a Catholic charity threatened with loss of its tax exemption by Wisconsin for offering services to non-Catholics; and dismissed the Mexican governments effort to sue U.S. gun manufacturers for drug cartel violence.\n\nFriday alone, the court ruled that the American judiciary is required to consider only the \"cases and controversies\" before it, and may not order nationwide injunctions; agreed parents may withdraw their children from classes that indoctrinate them in trans ideology; held that Texas may bar minors from viewing internet pornography; and strengthened Trumps powers to impose tariffs by reaffirming, in an unrelated case, that Congress can delegate power to executive agencies if it lays out the general policy, principles and boundaries.\n\nInMahmoud v. Taylor, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that indoctrinating children in trans ideology is \"critical to our Nations civic vitality\" and overrides the First Amendment right to religious freedom. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito blasted her \"deliberately blinkered view\" that the purpose of the program at issue was to teach kindness, adding that Sotomayor \"ignores what anyone who reads these books can readily see\" - that the purpose is to advocate the use of pronouns and choice of gender as \"values and beliefs\" to be \"celebrated\" and contrary values and beliefs to be \"rejected.\"\n\nInTrump v. CASA, Inc., a case the administration may ultimately lose involving Trumps authority to end birthright citizenship, the majority held that federal courts do not have the power to grant nationwide injunctions that go beyond the specific parties and issues before them to block administration orders.\n\nThe liberal justices dissented, complaining that the limitation would allow Trump too much leeway. Apparently tired of Jacksons substituting politics for legal analysis, in her majority opinion, Barrett excoriated Jacksons dissent for being untethered to any legal doctrine, dismissively declaiming: \"We will not dwell on Justice Jacksons argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself. We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.\"\n\nWhen Supreme Court justices and even the Ninth Circuit use strong language to rein in activist judges, the end of the imperial judiciary is nigh.\n\nKenin M.

    "News_title":"Megabill hits health care for immigrants, including legal ones, hard",
    "News_text":"As President Donald Trump intensifies his targeting of undocumented immigrants, the GOP megabill passed Thursday takes aim at those here legally by revoking their access to subsidized care.\n\nUnder current rules, those immigrants — green card holders, refugees, survivors of domestic violence, and individuals on work and student visas — can purchase health insurance on the Obamacare marketplace and receive tax credits to offset the cost. Some of them are also eligible for coverage through Medicaid, the state-federal program for low-income people, if they earn incomes below the poverty level, as well as Medicare, the federal program for elderly people.\n\nBut the provisions in the GOP megabill narrow immigrant eligibility for these programs, allowing only green card holders, immigrants from Cuba and Haiti, and immigrants from certain Pacific Island countries access to federally funded health care.\n\nThe move to restrict coverage for legal immigrants comes as the Trump administration pushes ahead on its aggressive immigration campaign, delivering mass deportations, challenging birthright citizenship, and ending temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants.\n\n“These are the largest cuts to health coverage that we have seen, and this will be one of the largest cuts to immigrants in recent years,” said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy think tank in Washington. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan scorekeeper, estimated similar provisions would leave 1.3 million lawfully present immigrants uninsured in 2034. Low-income green card holders in the five-year waiting period that applies to them for Medicaid, but who are currently eligible for subsidized Obamacare coverage, are expected to be the largest group hit.\n\nThe provisions have been overshadowed by broader Medicaid cuts, and the politically fraught nature of immigration has made Republicans reluctant to speak out about the restrictions. Still, they have raised concerns in both red and blue states because it would mean their already financially strained health care systems would have to bear the higher costs of uncompensated and emergency care.\n\n“There is a lot of concern about how some of the immigration policies and some of the enrollment policies might play out throughout our patient population and our communities,” said Jonathan Chapman, chief executive of the Florida Association of Community Health Centers, who flew to Washington last week to lobby Congress and the White House on the megabill. Over 70 percent of patients at the state’s federally qualified health centers are uninsured or on Medicaid, and they have already reduced services due to insufficient funding.\n\nChapman added that Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’ support for Trump’s crackdown has already discouraged patients from seeking care at the community health centers, even though they typically do not ask about immigration status. “If my status was not clearly defined, I would be concerned about signing anything,” he added.\n\nVern Buchanan(R-Fla.), vice chair of the Ways and Means Committee, told POLITICO the megabill “ensures that federal health care dollars are prioritized for American citizens.” Buchanan led a letter with 11 members of the Florida Republican House delegation supporting the megabill.\n\nUnder fiscal pressure, blue states, including Minnesota and Illinois, have moved to roll back health care access for undocumented immigrants, who are not eligible for any federally subsidized health care programs. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, approved a state budget that will scale back free health care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nOne of the hardest-hit states from the megabill restrictions on immigrants will be New York, which is one of three states that have enacted a basic health program allowed under the Affordable Care Act known as the Essential Plan.\n\nThe Essential Plan offers low-cost health insurance for New Yorkers earning up to 250 percent above the federal poverty line and is funded by federal dollars that would otherwise be used for ACA tax credits. The GOP megabill will strip coverage for half a million immigrants covered by the plan and shift the cost to New York. The state must pick up the tab because of a 2001 state court decision that requires it to cover immigrants who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status.\n\nThe state’s hospital lobby, the Greater New York Hospital Association, believes the provisions as a whole will cost New York $3 billion annually and leave 225,000 immigrant New Yorkers uninsured.\n\n“The downstream impacts are not just on immigrants,” said Elisabeth Wynn, executive vice president at the New York hospital group. “We don’t close services for a particular insurance category, those get closed for all.”\n\nEarlier this month, five Republican House members from New York wrote a letter to Senate Finance ChairMike Crapo(R-Idaho) urging a two- to three-year delay to the immigrant restrictions, warning an “abrupt elimination…will have drastically disruptive consequences for New York’s healthcare system.”\n\nThe bill will exclude lawfully present immigrants earning below the federal poverty level from the Obamacare marketplace starting next year. Marketplace restrictions for lawfully present immigrants earning above the poverty level will start in 2027.",
    "Atomic_Facts":"[\"The GOP megabill passed on July 4, 2025, will revoke access to subsidized health care for lawfully present immigrants, allowing only green card holders, immigrants from Cuba and Haiti, and certain Pacific Island immigrants to access federally funded health care.\", \"The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the provisions in the GOP megabill will leave 1.3 million lawfully present immigrants uninsured by 2034.\\n```\"]"

    "News_title":"LL Cool J says he won't perform at Philadelphia's July Fourth festival in support of workers strike",
    "News_text":"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Rapper LL Cool J and R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan say they will not perform at a Fourth of July festival in Philadelphia in support of a strikeby nearly 10,000 city workers in Philadelphia.\n\nLL Cool J had been scheduled to appear at the Wawa Welcome America Festival on Friday, along with Sullivan and other performers.\n\nLL Cool J said in a video posted on social media that “there's absolutely no way that I can perform, cross a picket line and pick up money when I know that people are out there fighting for a living wage.”\n\n“I hope, I hope, I hope that, you know, the mayor and the city can make a deal. I hope it works out,” he said.\n\nLL Cool J also said that he never wants to disappoint his fans and that he plans to be in Philadelphia in case an agreement is reached.\n\nThe festival comes as the strike moved into a fourth day Friday.Trash has been piling up in some areas, and more than 30 Medical Examiner’s Office staffers have been ordered back to work because of a growing backlog of bodies in storage.\n\nSullivan, a Philadelphia native and Grammy award-winning artist, said in a post on Instagram on Friday that she would stand with the striking workers “until the city and the union find a way to bring fair living wages to our working class. I love my city and I believe in you,” she wrote. “Hopefully we will get to celebrate when things are better.”\n\nThe latest talks between the city and leaders of District Council 33 — the largest of four major unions representing city workers — ended late Wednesday. Both sides have said they were willing to continue negotiations. The union represents many of the city’s blue-collar workers, from trash collectors to clerks to security guards. Police and firefighters are not on strike.\n\nThe city has offered a three-year contract with annual raises of about 3%, which the union said amounts to little more than $1,000 after taxes for members making $46,000 a year on average.\n\nMayor Cherelle Parker has said the city has “put its best offer on the table.” She stressed that the effective 13% pay hike over her four-year term -- including last year’s 5% bump – along with a fifth step on the pay scale would be the best contract the union has seen in decades.\n\nParker responded to LL Cool J's statement, saying that she spoke with him on Thursday.\n\n\"I respect his decision, and understand his desire to see the city unified,\" the mayor said. “He is always welcome in Philadelphia.”\n\nThe union also responded, saying LL Cool J's support for municipal workers “highlights his commitment to social justice and community well-being.”\n\n“His support not only brings attention to our efforts but also inspires others to recognize and advocate for the rights and respect of all workers,” the union said. “It’s heartening to see public figures using their influence to champion causes that matter to everyday people.”\n\nOn Thursday, Common Pleas Court Judge Sierra Thomas-Street approved the city’s request to have the medical examiner’s office staffers return to work because bodies have been piling up there in storage, posing a health and safety risk. Those workers include death and forensic investigators, forensic technicians and clerks.\n\nThe order came a day after the judge ordered some emergency service dispatchers and essential water department employees back to work.\n\nMounting trash piles in some parts of the city were also still causing grief for residents and officials, who have strongly urged residents to follow the collection guidelines imposed when the strike began Tuesday. They also urged residents to report problems at the trash collection sites, and noted trash is being cleared as fast as possible and the city is working to open more sites.",

Forecasters warn of waves reaching 4 to 6 feet, with occasional sets up to 7 feet, especially at south-facing beaches.\n\nThe elevated surf, which weather officials say is driven by an uptick in southerly swell, is expected to generate strong rip and longshore currents, which can be life-threatening, even for experienced swimmers.\n\nAs explained by the National Weather Service, rip currents are powerful, channeled currents of water flowing away from shore. They typically extend from the shoreline, through the surf zone, and past the line of breaking waves. Rip currents can occur at any beach with breaking waves.\n\nIf you get caught in a rip current, it’s important to stay calm and follow these steps to get out safely:\n\nRemain calm to conserve energy and think clearly.\n\nNever fight against the current.\n\nThink of it like a treadmill that cannot be turned off, which you need to step to the side of.\n\nSwim out of the current in a direction following the shoreline. When out of the current, swim at an angle–away from the current–towards shore.\n\nIf you are unable to swim out of the rip current, float or calmly tread water.

A short time later, prosecutors filed an emergency motion asking that Moore be placed on a GPS monitoring device.\n\nMoore’s defense team is objecting.\n\nTheFox 8 I-Teamwas first to report that Moore posted the bond. His attorney, Jon Paul Rion, said the bond was set at $2 million during Moore’s arraignment in May. The only condition of the bond in the case was that Moore stay away from Sherman’s family. Rion added that a pretrial was held last month and prosecutors did not ask for any other restrictions on the bond.\n\nRion said community members, who believe in Moore’s innocence, were able to raise the money to post his bond.\n\nA bondsman was at the jail to meet Moore, who walked out wearing shorts, and no electronic monitoring device. The I-Team was also at the jail when he left and asked him several questions about the case. Moore declined to answer.  He said nothing as he walked with the bondsman to a truck and left.\n\n“There has been no change in circumstances warranting a  modification of Moore’s current bond conditions,” Rion told the I-Team.

Surrounding buildings were damaged.\n\nThe mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, appealed to the population on social media to leave the affected area as a precaution.\n\nThe blast came amid a lengthy heatwave in the Italian capital, with temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius.\n\nMedical tents were set up at the scene, and the city of Rome called on people to keep their windows closed and not to use external air conditioning.\n\nThe Italian Society of Environmental Medicine also warned that inhaling high concentrations of liquid gas can cause nausea, dizziness, neurological disorders, loss of consciousness and, in severe cases, suffocation.\n\nPoliticians expressed sympathy and support, as did Pope Leo XIV.",

TheFourth of Julyis on a Friday this year, which mean a long weekend, which means a lot of brilliant, bright and colorful fireworks will be shot off in millions of driveways, parking lots, secluded areas and main squares to celebrate this country's Independence Day.\n\nAnd if you're not careful, the results can be harmful, horrific, or even fatal.\n\nAn estimated 14,700 people were injured by fireworks and 11 people were killed in 2024, according to theU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission(CPSC). That's an increase of 38% in deaths and about 52% more injuries over 2023. There also were an estimated 1,700 emergency room treated injuries in 2024 just involving sparklers, nearly two and half times more than the previous year.\n\nThe American Fireworks Standards Laboratory listed 19 fireworks-related fatalities in 2024 inits own annual report, released in June.\n\nMost of the reported injuries were to adults aged 25 to 44, the CSPC said, followed by people aged 15 to 24. The most common injuries were burns (37%), and the most frequently injured body parts were hands and fingers (36%) and head, face, and ears (22%).\n\nAre fireworks legal in Florida?What to know about buying them and when you can set them off for the Fourth of July\n\n\"To a firework, your body is sentient gelatin,\" the CPSCposted to Bluesky. \"Nothing more. Nothing less. Remember that and use fireworks safely this July 4th.\"\n\nA few years ago, the CPSC blew up a lot of mannequins to demonstrate exactly how horrifying the results might be if you're not careful. And all of those violently illustrative examples can easily be avoided.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2024, there have been 178 fireworks-related deaths in the United States, the CPSC said.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nThis should be a no-brainer. Fuses can be unpredictable even in professionally made fireworks, many fireworks do not pass federal standards, and holding onto lit fireworks are what send most people to the hospital.\n\n\"People die doing this every year,\" the CSPC said.\n\nIn the agency's tests of selected fireworks sold in the U.S. during fiscal year 2023, nearly 20% were found to contain noncompliant components, including fuse violations, the presence of prohibited chemicals and pyrotechnic materials overload. Multiple types of fireworks wererecalled this yearafter reports of premature explosions and burn hazards.\n\nThe agency urges people to let professionals handle fireworks or take steps to handle them safely. Never set off a mortar-style device while holding it and never look inside the tubes after they fire to see if anything's left.\n\nKaboom! Yipe!How to protect your dog from freaking out over Fourth of July fireworks\n\nThis is a horrible idea, right up there with \"never place any part of your body over a lit firework.\"\n\nSparklers may seem like the fun, \"safe\" fireworks to give to kids while the adults set off the big ones in the driveway, but the burn at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit and sent 1700 people to the ER last year, according to the report.\n\n\"GenX friends, we know your parents just handed you sparklers,\"the CSPC posted. \"They didn't have the Consumer Product Safety Commission on their phone like you do now. Maybe if they'd known sparklers burn as hot as a blowtorch they would have reconsidered (maybe). Once we know better, we must do better.\"\n\nTheAmerican Pyrotechnics Associationrecommends never lighting or holding more than one sparkler at a time, and keeping them at an arm's length away from the body. Children under 12 should remain under adult supervision and safer alternatives should be considered, such as glow sticks, confetti poppers or colored streamers.\n\nAccording to the CPSC report, the parts of the body most often injured by fireworks in 2024 were hands and fingers (36%) and head, face and ears (22%).\n\nWhen you're working with explosives that were not made professionally to federal standards of safety, that number can go up.\n\nNever try to re-light or pick up fireworks that have not ignited fully. There is no way to tell what will happen, or how quickly.\n\nTheNational Safety Counciloffers these tips\n\nDo not use illegal fireworks.\n\nNever allow children to handle fireworks.\n\nNever use fireworks while impaired by drugs or alcohol.\n\nWear eye protection.\n\nNever hold lighted fireworks in your hands.\n\nNever light fireworks indoors.\n\nUse fireworks only away from people, houses and flammable material.\n\nNever point or throw fireworks at another person.\n\nLight only one device at a time and maintain a safe distance.\n\nNever ignite devices in a container.\n\nNever relight or handle a malfunctioning firework.\n\nSoak spent and unused fireworks in water for a few hours before tossing them out.\n\nKeep water nearby to extinguish fireworks if a fire breaks out.\n\nInstead of sparklers, consider using safer alternatives, such as glow sticks, confetti poppers and colored streamers.\n\nExplosive fireworks are banned in Floridaevery day except for three: July 4, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, although there may be local ordinances or HOA rules regarding them.\n\nThere is also an exemption if you are using them for agricultural or fishery purposes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Times-Union:Fireworks deaths, injuries rose dramatically in 2024, the CSPC said",

On Tuesday, some South Dakotans received a large postcard from Doeden’s campaign featuring a photo of a bloody Trump after an assassination attempt, with the headine “Will you answer President Trump’s call?”\n\nThe other declared Republican candidate for governor is the speaker of the state House of Representatives, Jon Hansen, whoannouncedin April. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden — who is serving the remainder of Kristi Noem’s term after sheresignedfor a post in the Trump administration — has not announced whether he’s running.\n\nJohnson said accusations that he’s not supportive of Trump “are not criticisms I generally hear these days.”\n\n“We’re in a political environment where people love to level accusations. And the reality is, I kind of reject the labels,” Johnson said. “I’m just a conservative who’s trying to get things done. And clearly, that means working with President Trump, and we’ve got a great working relationship. He’s had me down in Mar-a-Lago. He’s had me at the Super Bowl. We talk regularly about policy.”\n\nJohnson, 48, is a married father of three from Mitchell who is currently serving his fourth term as South Dakota’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe following conversation with Johnson has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI love the state. I think the next 20 years for South Dakota could be the best in our history, but I don’t think that’s a sure thing. I think to realize that future, we need a real plan. I think we need real leadership, and I’m excited to be the person who pulls together that plan and pulls together that team.\n\nIn many respects, I think the challenges facing South Dakota right now are the right fit for my skill set.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding.Ultimately, the Republican voters get a say.The Republican voters like the job I do, they understand the conservative and pragmatic worldview that I bring to my work, and they like it.\n\nThose are not criticisms I generally hear these days.I mean, I think if you were to ask Chat GPT to gather up all of the political articles of the last two years, I think one narrative would be that Dusty Johnson is just too close to Donald Trump.\n\nI don’t try to be any particular type of Republican. I just try to be a conservative who gets things done.\n\nThe whole label conversation is kind of ridiculous. It maybe tells you what a dysfunctional age we’re in that I can be an architect of some of the major successes of the House in the last seven months — securing the border, cutting spending and reforming welfare — and somehow, for some people, that’s not enough.\n\nAnytime the federal government cuts anything, there is a narrative that the sky is falling. And clearly, some of these cuts are uncomfortable, and I don’t want to be cavalier about them. I mean, these are real programs that matter. And yet, $24 million out of a$7 billion state budgetis about one-third of 1% of the state budget.\n\nSouth Dakotans are resilient enough. We’re resourceful enough to be able to tighten our belt and still get the important things done, even in the face of a federal government that absolutely must move toward fiscal responsibility.\n\nI’m proud of those fiscally responsible votes that I’ve taken. I know they’re not always easy, but if we don’t take care of business, our country will go bankrupt.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nNumber one, we do need to cut property taxes. And unlike some, I think we need to do it in a responsible way that protects those core services and roads, bridges, cops and schools.\n\nNumber two, we need to make college and technical school more affordable. And we need to double down on the programs and the research that really moves South Dakota forward.\n\nIn K-12, we need to be relentless about student achievement. We are not talking enough about student achievement. We need to set real goals, we need to use real data. We can’t be afraid to lead.\n\nWe need to focus more on drugs and addiction if we want safer communities. We need new interdiction teams, and we need smarter training and treatment within the walls of our prisons.\n\nAnd we need to grow this economy so we can keep taxes low. That’s going to come from new small businesses, new energy production, dairy expansion and bringing high-tech jobs home to South Dakota.\n\nI think we need to focus our property tax relief on the owner-occupied residential, and really, the farmer-managed ag property.\n\nWe have plenty of out-of-staters who own plenty of property in South Dakota, and I’m just not as interested in giving them a tax break.\n\nI’m a big supporter of educational choice and properly funding our public schools.\n\nI’ve got three sons who are products of public schools, and our Mitchell schools have done an incredible job with my boys.\n\nWe’re very involved parents. We spend a lot of time focusing on what they’re learning. And I think the quality of the education is excellent. And I think, as long as we are properly funding our public school systems, then I think we’re allowed the flexibility to ask if there are other educational opportunities that we can invest in as well.\n\nIt’s not my interest in re-litigating every decision that the last administration has done. Fundamentally, this has got to be a forward-looking campaign. And so I just don’t know that there’s any benefit in me being critical of anything that Governor Rhoden has done.\n\nFirst off, let’s put this into context: This is not a South Dakota problem. It’s a problem in South Dakota, but it’s a problem everywhere. Literally, every one of the 50 states has chronic and severe workforce shortages in child care and health care.\n\nSo, I think we need to be honest with ourselves that this is going to take a multi-year, focused effort to solve. This is, in part, closing the skills gap. I think we need to identify people who can go into those fields and do a better job of getting them the education they need.\n\nThere is no silver bullet. It will be 100 solutions that address this problem, not one big one.\n\nWe have to care about the rule of law. And so, what does the rule of law mean? That means that you only get to do those things that are lawful exercises of power.\n\nHere’s what we know: The federal judiciary has said that the way the president handled the birthright citizenship case is permissible for now; they have said that his use of the National Guard is permissible for now; the firing of independent inspectors general was also permissible.\n\nAnd so, it’s an interesting allegation for people to say that the president is being an authoritarian when he is following court orders. He has won in these court cases.\n\nI feel like it would be inappropriate for him to ignore a federal court order, but he hasn’t. He’s been winning these things, so it’s an odd accusation for them to make that he’s the one who is violating the rule of law.",

    "News_text":"BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KGET) — The Fourth of July brings joy and excitement to many. For others, it brings disaster, in the form of an inferno.\n\nFor local fire departments, it brings a heavy workload.\n\n“Especially in the evening with fireworks going off, our call volume jumps tremendously,” said Alexander Clark with the Bakersfield Fire Department.\n\nOne of the key issues that Bakersfield and Kern County fire tackle every year is the use of illegal fireworks, which shoot up into the air and rain down embers. They look pretty, but for the untrained user, they can be too much to handle.\n\nReporting illegal fireworks during the Independence Day holiday in Kern County\n\n“Something goes wrong on the ground or in the air, and those fall back to earth, back on someone’s house, and they cause fire, they cause people to lose their houses over a one-time event each year,” said Clark.\n\n“They’re illegal because they’re unsafe,” said Kern County Fire Capt. Andrew Freeborn. “There are safe options for individuals to use, they’re called Safe and Sane fireworks, and those are the fireworks that individuals can purchase at the fireworks booths.”\n\nKern County residents have always been able to report the use or sale of illegal fireworks, but many who want to report call the emergency 911 hotline. Clark and Freeborn say, while they appreciate the report, the influx of non-emergency calls backs up their operators.\n\n“911 is for emergencies,” said Freeborn. “We cannot have emergency services slowed down from dispatching real emergencies to field complaints for illegal fireworks.”\n\nClose\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nWatch for us in your inbox.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\n“You’re calling 911 just to report illegal fireworks,” said Clark. “But with thousands of calls of illegal fireworks, it ties up the 911 system and makes it harder for those with a serious emergency to get through.”\n\nAn emergency would be any life-threatening situation, such as fires — whether started by fireworks or not — and medical emergencies.\n\nIf you see someone using illegal fireworks, instead of calling 911, you’re urged to report them online atYouLightItWeWriteIt.com.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Blue state lawmakers' response to Medicaid cuts: Keep calm and bash Republicans",
    "News_text":"Most blue state governors and lawmakers are responding to hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts in the GOP’s megabill in one way: Do nothing for now — and blame Republicans.\n\nCongress’ Medicaid cuts came as dozens of state legislatures dried the ink on their own annual budgets and adjourned — some for the summer, many for the year. But in the face of a funding chasm no state can bridge, uncertainty over the effects of the cuts and the view that Republicans will take the lion’s share of the blame, many blue states are opting to wait and see before trying to solve a problem they didn’t create.\n\nThe megabill, which passed Thursday, cuts roughly $1 trillion from Medicaid. While a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals was added last minute to assuage Republicans representing some rural and purple districts, there are still strong concerns over how the cuts will affect the millions of Americans on Medicaid and the rural communities that overwhelmingly voted to send President Donald Trump back to the White House.\n\nStates that took advantage of the Medicaid expansion programs created by the Affordable Care Act stand to lose the most. Some GOP-led states, like Ohio, already have plans to roll back their own expansions in the wake of Congress’ cuts. But few states have the budget capability to make up for the massive sums of federal dollars they could lose from cuts to Medicaid, food assistance and other benefit programs.\n\nRather than make eleventh hour budget changes or immediately summon special sessions, Democratic lawmakers launched last-ditch efforts to get Congress to reject the bill. While ultimately unsuccessful, the strategy is a sign of how Democrats may continue to message federal cuts headed into the 2026 midterms.\n\n“You don't have to be a genius political consultant to conclude that it’s a pretty devastating political message,” said veteran Democratic strategist Lis Smith. “The only thing voters hate more than people who take away their benefits are people who lie and take away their benefits.”\n\nLawmakers and party officials quickly organized events across the country to pin the blame for the Medicaid cuts on the GOP. Alaska Democrats held an emergency town hall on Wednesday — attended by Sen.Ruben Gallego(D-Ariz.) — to criticize Republican SenatorsLisa MurkowskiandDan Sullivan, and Rep.Nick Begichfor voting in favor of the bill. Murkowski’s support was key to its passage by a single vote.\n\nIn blue Colorado, Sen.John Hickenlooper and Gov. Jared Polis, along with Democratic House members and state lawmakers, held a virtual rally on the “extreme” budget bill — which passed with only Republican support.\n\nDemocrats can, generally speaking, afford to wait. Many of the cuts won’t hit until fall at the earliest, with the bulk going into effect next year. Most Democrats believe that Republicans will largely take any blame leveled.\n\nPart of the problem for Democratic lawmakers is that no matter what they do, an insurmountable gulf remains between what their states can contribute versus what they will lose in federal dollars.\n\n“We're going to do everything we can to preserve health care, but there's no way we can get … billions of dollars that they're taking away,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Wednesday. The governors of Washington, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Arizona echoed Pritzker’s sentiment in recent days.\n\nIn New York and California, leaders are already hedging their bets. Democratic Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York and Gavin Newsom of California could face pressure from supporters hoping they’ll be compelled to make up at least some of the gap left by Congress and President Donald Trump. Hochul was already putting blame squarely on the state’s Republican House members as the GOP megabill neared the finish line.\n\n“They’re in the majority, they have the power,”Hochul said of the delegation. “You have the power, and if you don’t use that power, then you are complicit in this attack on the American people.”\n\nSome states — including New Mexico, Massachusetts and Oregon — have already made preparations for the anticipated cuts by preemptively increasing state health care program dollars or leaving an unallocated surplus in budgets passed this spring.\n\nOregon’s recently-passed budget included $10 million for reproductive health in anticipation of cuts to federal funding for Planned Parenthood, for example. New Mexico — which has one of the nation’s highest poverty rates and relies deeply on federal medicaid dollars and SNAP — will lose $2.8 billion in federal funding under the Big Beautiful Bill, according to numbers shared with POLITICO by the New Mexico Health Care Authority. The state’s all-volunteer Legislature created aFederal Funding Stablization Committeespecifically to address the cuts, and passed a bill in March that creates a trust fund to protect its Medicaid program. The first allocation into the trust fund was just $300 million, however, a far cry from the nearly $3 billion in cuts. But the fund is set to increase gradually until it reaches $2 billion.\n\nIn New Jersey, which finalized its budget late Monday with a $6.7 billion surplus, state Senate President Nick Scutari said even that large reserve won’t make up for the federal cuts. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy does not have immediate plans to call the legislature back into session\n\nMost states, in fact, say they have the time to wait.\n\nA spokesperson for Colorado’s Polis said the governor “is considering all options, including whether a special session would be needed.” California officials told POLITICO it’s too soon to know how the cuts will affect Medi-Cal or the state budget, but policy experts said the state may have to open up the budget this year to begin creating the tech infrastructure needed to process the new work requirements included in the megabill. That could include sending money to counties to hire welfare eligibility workers.\n\nAs Democrats sort out their approach, they believe they have political winds at their backs.\n\n“If your home burns down, you blame the arsonists. You don't blame the firefighters,” said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. “The challenge for Democrats is keeping the focus on the arsonist who lit the match” between now and the 2026 midterms, he explained.\n\nIn red Ohio, the Legislature’s Democratic minority already believes the cuts will help them scrape away at the state’s Republican supermajority. The state legislature recently passed a budget with trigger language that would roll back state Medicaid coverage if federal contributions to the program are reduced by 10 percent or more. State Rep. Tristan Rader, a progressive Democrat, said the effects of the state cuts would be felt sooner than the federal cuts.\n\n“Without Trump at the top of the ticket, we know that we can take back a few seats,” Rader told POLITICO. “They’re making incredibly unpopular decisions of giving away literally billions of dollars to billionaires while undercutting education and Medicaid — we know that's not popular.”\n\nShia Kapos, Ry Rivard, Rachel Bluth and Kelly Garrity contributed to this report",

    "News_title":"At least 24 dead in Texas flash flooding; two dozen young campers missing",
    "News_text":"By Steve Gorman\n\n(Reuters) -Torrential rains unleashed flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas on Friday, killing at least 24 people as rescue teams scrambled to save dozens of victims trapped by high water or reported missing in the disaster, local officials said.\n\nAmong the missing were 23 to 25 people listed as unaccounted for at an all-girls Christian summer camp located on the banks of the rain-engorged Guadalupe, authorities said.\n\nAt a news conference late on Friday, almost 18 hours after the July Fourth crisis began, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said search-and-rescue operations would press on through the night and into Saturday.\n\nAbbott said resources devoted to the effort would be \"limitless.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One at the end of a day of public events,President Donald Trumpsaid \"we'll take care of them,\" when asked about federal aid for the disaster.\n\nThe U.S. National Weather Service declared a flash flood emergency for parts of Kerr County in south-central Texas Hill Country, about 65 miles (105 km) northwest of San Antonio, following thunderstorms that dumped as much as a foot of rain.\n\nDalton Rice, city manager for Kerrville, the county seat, told reporters the extreme flooding struck before dawn with little or no warning, precluding authorities from issuing advance evacuation orders as the Guadalupe swiftly rose above major flood stage.\n\n\"This happened very quickly, over a very short period of time that could not be predicted, even with radar,\" Rice said. \"This happened within less than a two-hour span.\"\n\nState emergency management officials had warned as early as Thursday that west and central Texas faced heavy rains and flash flood threats \"over the next couple days,\" citing National Weather Service forecasts ahead of the holiday weekend.\n\nBut the weather forecasts in question \"did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,\" W. Nim Kidd, director of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, told a news conference on Friday night.\n\nJuly Fourth fireworks displays ended up being canceled in flood-stricken communities throughout the region, including Kerrville, where the waterfront site for Friday night's planned U.S. Independence Day celebration was submerged by the rain-swollen river.\n\nAt Friday night's briefing, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said 24 flood-related fatalities had been confirmed, up from 13 tallied earlier in the day.\n\nOne more person found dead in neighboring Kendall County was not confirmed to be a flood-related casualty, Leitha said.\n\nPRAYERS FOR THE MISSING\n\nLieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said on Friday afternoon that authorities were searching for 23 girls listed as missing from among more than 750 children at summer camp sites along the banks of the Guadalupe River when the area was inundated by floodwaters at around 4 a.m. local time.\n\nThe missing campers had all been attending Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls.\n\n\"We're praying for all those missing to be found alive,\" Patrick said.\n\nIt was not clear whether anyone unaccounted for might have ended up among the deceased victims tallied countywide by the sheriff.\n\nOtherwise, all other campers were safe, authorities said, with campers being evacuated throughout the day.\n\n\"Everybody is doing everything in their power to get these kids out,\" Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, the top local elected official, had said at a news briefing on the disaster hours earlier.\n\nKelly said a number of scattered residential subdivisions, recreational vehicle parks and campgrounds were hit hard.\n\nPressed by reporters why more precautions were not taken with stormy weather in the forecast, Kelly insisted a disaster of such magnitude was unforeseen.\n\n\"We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States,\" Kelly said. \"We had no reason to believe this was going to be anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever.\"\n\nIn an alert on Thursday, the Texas Division of Emergency Management said it had increased its readiness level and \"activated additional state emergency response resources\" as parts of west and central Texas braced \"for continued heavy rainfall and flash flooding threats heading into the holiday weekend.\"\n\nLieutenant Governor Patrick said the Guadalupe River had risen 26 feet (8 m) in 45 minutes as heavy showers soaked the region.\n\nAs of Friday night, emergency personnel had rescued or evacuated 237 people, including 167 by helicopter.\n\nWith additional rain forecast in the region, Patrick warned that an ongoing threat for possible flash flooding extended from San Antonio to Waco for the next 24 to 48 hours.\n\nOn Friday night, Governor Abbott signed a disaster declaration to hasten emergency assistance to Kerr and a cluster of additional counties hardest hit by the floods.\n\nPersonnel from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency also were activated to assist local authorities in confronting the crisis, officials said.\n\n(Writing and reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Additional reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa, Jasper Ward in Washington, Acharya Bhargav in Toronto, and Daniel Trotta in Carlsbad, California; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Tom Hogue)",
