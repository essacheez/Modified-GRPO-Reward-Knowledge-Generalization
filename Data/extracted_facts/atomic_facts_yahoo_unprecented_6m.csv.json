    "News_text":"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers signed a new two-year budget in the early morning hours Thursday in a race against Congress to ensure the state gets afederal Medicaid matchthat it would lose under PresidentDonald Trump'stax and spending cuts package.\n\nIn an extraordinarily rapid succession of events, Evers and Republican lawmakers unveiled acompromise budget dealon Tuesday, the Senate passed it Wednesday night and just before 1 a.m. on Thursday, the Assembly passed it. Evers signed it in his conference room minutes later.\n\nDemocrats who voted against the $111 billion spending bill said it didn't go far enough in meeting their priorities of increasing funding for schools, child care and expanding Medicaid. Evers, who hasn't decided on whether he will seek a third term, hailed the compromise as the best deal that could be reached.\n\n“I believe most Wisconsinites would say that compromise is a good thing because that is how government is supposed to work,” Evers said.\n\nWisconsin’s budget would affect nearly every person in the battleground state. Income taxes would be cut for working people and retirees by $1.4 billion, sales taxes would be eliminated on residential electric bills, and it would cost more to get a driver’s license, buy license plates and title a vehicle.\n\nUnprecedented speed\n\nThere was urgency to pass the budget because of one part that increases an assessment on hospitals to help fund the state’s Medicaid program and hospital provider payments. Medicaid cutsup for final approvalthis week in Congress cap how much states can get from the federal government through those fees.\n\nThe budget would increase Wisconsin’s assessment rate from 1.8% to the federal maximum of 6% to access federal matching funds. But if the federal bill is enacted first, Wisconsin could not raise the fee, putting $1.5 billion in funding for rural hospitals at risk.\n\nIn the rush to get done, Republicans took the highly unusual move of bringing the budget up for votes on the same day. In at least the past 50 years, the budget has never passed both houses on the same day.\n\n“We need to get this thing done today so we have the opportunity to access federal funding,” Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said at the start of debate just before 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nGovernors typically take several days to review and sign the budget after it’s passed, but Evers took just minutes.\n\nBipartisan compromise\n\nIn a concession to the Democratic governor, Republicans agreed to spend more money on special education services in K-12 schools, subsidize child care costs and give the Universities of Wisconsin its biggest increase in nearly two decades. The plan would likely result in higher property taxes in many school districts due to no increase in general aid to pay for operations.\n\nRepublicans needed Democratic votes\n\nThe Senate passed the budget 19-14, with five Democrats joining with 14 Republicans to approve it. Four Republicans joined 10 Democrats in voting no. The Assembly passed it 59-39 with six Democrats in support. One Republican voted against it.\n\nDemocratic senators were brought into budget negotiations in the final days to secure enough votes to pass it.\n\n“It’s a bipartisan deal,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein said before the vote. “I think everybody left the table wishing it was different, but this is something everyone has agreed on.”\n\nDemocrats said newly drawn legislative maps, which helped thempick up seatsin November and narrow the Republican majorities, led to greater compromise this year.\n\n“That gave us leverage, that gave us an opportunity to have a conversation,” Democratic Sen. Mark Spreitzer said.\n\nStill, Spreitzer said the budget “fell far short of what was needed on our priorities.” He and other Democrats said it didn’t go far enough to help fund child care, K-12 schools and higher education, in particular.\n\nEvers vetoes prison closure deadline\n\nThe budget called forclosing a troubled aging prisonin Green Bay by 2029, but Evers used his partial veto to strike that provision. He left $15 million in to support the closure, but objected to setting a date without a clear plan for getting it done.\n\nThe governor noted in his veto message that the state has “painful experience” with trying to close prisons without a fleshed-out plan, highlighting that the state's youth prison remains open even though lawmakers passed a bill to close the facility in 2017.\n\n“Green Bay Correctional Institution should close — on that much, the Legislature and I agree,” Evers wrote. “It is simply not responsible or tenable to require doing so by a deadline absent a plan to actually accomplish that goal by the timeline set.”\n\nJim Rafter, president of the village of Allouez, the suburb where the prison is, issued a statement Friday saying the veto shows how broken the state government has become.\n\n“The time for studying has come and gone,” he said. “The Village of Allouez and our community demand action and the certainty they deserve about when this facility will be closed.”\n\nGovernor kills grant as payback for ending stewardship\n\nEvers used his partial veto powers to wipe out provisions in the budget that would have handed the town of Norway in southeastern Wisconsin an annual $100,000 grant to control water runoff from State Highway 36. The governor said in his veto message that he eliminated the grant because Republicans refused to extend the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship Program.\n\nThat program provides funding for the state and outside groups to buy land for conservation and recreation. Republicans have complained for years that the program is too expensive and removes too much land from property tax rolls, hurting municipalities. Funding is set to expire next year. Evers proposed allocating $1 billion to extend the program for another decade, but Republicans eliminated the provision.\n\nEvers accused legislators in his veto message of abandoning their responsibility to continue the program while using the runoff grant to help “the politically connected few.” He did not elaborate.\n\nThe town of Norway lies within state Rep. Chuck Wichgers’ and Sen. Julian Bradley's districts; both are Republicans. Bradley, who sits on the Legislature's powerful budget-writing committee, called the veto “nothing more than political retribution.” Wichgers didn't return a voicemail.\n\nRep. Tony Kurtz and Sen. Pat Testin, both Republicans, introduced a bill last month that would extend the stewardship program through mid-2030, but the measure has yet to get a hearing.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Todd Richmond contributed to this report.",

    "News_title":"Oregon police erred in use of aerial surveillance camera for marijuana bust, appeals court says",
    "News_text":"A drone flies above Eugene. Oregon’s Court of Appeals chided the Oregon State Police Wednesday for using warrantless, “technologically-enhanced surveillance” to bust an illegal marijuana operation. (Photo courtesy of Eugene Police Department)\n\nOregon’s Court of Appeals chided the state’s police force on Wednesday for using warrantless “technologically-enhanced surveillance” to bust an illegal marijuana operation, sending the court’s clearest message yet about how law enforcement may use the increasingly popular, but controversial technology.\n\nThe case, captured in aneight-page rulingfrom a three-judge panel, centers on a June 2021 multi-county investigation involving the Polk County Sheriff’s Office and Oregon State Police. The defendant, 54-year-oldSengdara Nakhiengchahn, was not the target of the investigation, but Oregon State Police Sergeant Tyler Bechtel, a leading officer on the case, noticed “what looked to be a massive agricultural operation” that “was likely a marijuana grow,” while flying in a surveillance plane nearly 5,000 feet in the air, according to the ruling.\n\nThe defendant was charged in August 2021 with two felonies for possession and manufacturing of marijuana. She pled guilty in a conditional deal that allowed her to get the possession charge dropped by serving two years of probation, court records show. But she maintained her right to appeal the charges, arguing the evidence gathered from aerial surveillance constitutes a warrantless and unlawful search and should not have been admissible.\n\nThe appeals court agreed with Nakhiengchahn, returning the case back to the trial court where she can withdraw her guilty plea. Bechtel did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\n“While the trial court didn’t agree with us, we’re grateful the appellate court did,” said Luke Miller, Nakhiengchahn’s trial attorney, in a statement. “It’s important for Oregonians to maintain the right to privacy, and be free from government intrusion absent legal justification for such intrusion.”\n\nJenny Hansson, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Justice, said officials were still reviewing the decision and could decide to appeal the court’s ruling in the coming weeks.\n\nJolene Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Oregon State Police, declined to comment on the ruling or its findings, but said in an email the agency “remains committed to following applicable laws and court directives.”\n\nThe ruling was lauded by civil rights advocates and privacy watchdogs who were fresh off of a fight in the Oregon Legislature overSenate Bill 238, which would have extended unprecedented power to police to use unmanned aerial surveillance devices like drones when responding to 911 calls, executing a warrant, or responding to “exigent circumstances.” The bill ultimately died in the House Rules Committee without a vote.\n\nThe ACLU of Oregon opposed the bill,warningin a news release that it was unnecessary and “undermines basic rights including privacy and free speech.”\n\nKelly Simon, legal director of the ACLU of Oregon, said Wednesday’s ruling marks an “important decision to ensure that as police technology advances, we are maintaining the integrity of our warrant requirements under the Oregon Constitution.”\n\n“We’re beginning to see in the surveillance tech industry all sorts of high-powered enhancements,” she told the Capital Chronicle. “It is important that our courts maintain the integrity of our warrant requirements by making sure that if law enforcement wants to use those enhancements, they go to court first, they present the evidence they have against a person, and they get permission to do that.”\n\nIn the ruling, Justice Scott A. Shorr wrote that state police saw “materially different information” through a camera attached to their aircraft than what could’ve been seen with a naked eye, striking down a decision by Polk County Circuit Judge Rafael A. Caso to allow evidence tied to the camera footage to be admitted at trial.\n\n“We have never upheld as constitutionally permissible an officer’s technologically enhanced surveillance to see what was otherwise indiscernible. We decline to do so here,” Shorr said. “In this case, the officer used technology to obtain information from inside defendant’s private structures that was undetectable from his vantage point in public airspace.”\n\nOregon courts have held that officers can use aerial surveillance in illicit marijuana cases, but only if officers can identify plants without aids that enhance vision beyond what the naked eye can see. That has allowed them to perform inspections of different marijuana farms and suspected facilities from heights as low as 500 feet, using tools like night vision scopes to increase lighting.\n\nThe recorded footage of the defendant’s house that was captured by Sgt. Bechtel was handed to the local Polk County sheriff, who worked with a neighbor of the defendant to take photos of her house, including evidence of cannabis plants. Officers then observed marijuana greenhouses from a road nearby the house. That evidence, along with the aerial images, allowed them to get a search warrant.\n\nThe Court of Appeals on Wednesday did not go so far as to outright ban the technology in question, noting their decision was “narrow and confined to the circumstances of this case.” But the court signaled that officials must be ready to have separate evidence to back up their assertions if they do use enhanced aerial surveillance from devices like helicopters, jets or drones as evidence for a warrant or arrest.\n\n“This opinion does not preclude the ability of police to use technol­ogy, under certain circumstances, to aid in their aerial obser­vations,” the opinion reads. “We have repeatedly upheld the police use of technol­ogy to record what was openly visible to the observing officers.”\n\nThe camera Bechtel used was a Wescam MX-10, manufactured by one of the largest defense contractors in the United States — Florida-based L3Harris Technologies. A spokesperson for the group said “we do not have a comment to offer” in an email.\n\nThe device still appears to be in favor with Oregon lawmakers, who recently approved $1.2 million for State Police to purchase another Wescam MX-10 camera during the latest legislative session. Though it’s been billed as a way “to assist the department with a camera with thermal capabilities,” the camera has also beenadvertised bymilitary equipment sellers on helicopters and small planes for “low-altitude” and “tactical surveillance” scenarios.\n\n“The camera would provide rapid identification of lost or missing persons during search and rescue operations or natural disasters and enable pilots to find hidden and dangerous suspects during critical incidents,” reads a recent Oregon State Police budgetproposal. “The Wescam MX-10 would also significantly enhance communication with the ability to stream live video and communicate directly with [Oregon State Police] command for critical incidents and natural disasters.”\n\nKelly of the Oregon State Police did not respond to a question about how many of these similar cameras the agency has used in the past few years.\n\nThe use of such technology without warrant alarmed a leader of another major national privacy advocacy group, who criticized law enforcement that “conduct warrantless searches and erode our privacy.”\n\n“The Court of Appeals reached the right decision here,” said Jeramie D. Scott, senior counsel and director for the D.C.-based Electronic Privacy Information Center’s Project on Surveillance Oversight, in a statement. “Hopefully in the future, Oregon State Police will seek a warrant first to conduct this type of aerial surveillance, so a neutral arbiter can decide whether the search is warranted.”\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "News_title":"Conservative Arizona Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick has a warning for America",
    "News_text":"Clint Bolick is worried.\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court justice and rock star of the political right stood before a crowd of lawyers recently and rebuked \"deeply disturbing\" attacks on the American justice system coming from senior Trump administration officials.\n\n\"It's almost dystopian. And when I think of people wrapping themselves in the Constitution while they are simultaneously doing violence to it ... it is really scary stuff,\" Bolick told those gathered at the May event hosted by Society for the Rule of Law, a right-of-center legal organization.\n\nThough he didn't name names, the speech showed an extraordinary level of openness for a Supreme Court justice, as justices typically refrain from commenting on public affairs to avoid perceptions of bias.\n\nThe fact the remarks came from Bolick, \"a leader in center-of-right litigation and legal thinking,\" was \"tremendously important,\" said Gregg Nunziata, executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law.\n\nAs America celebrates its 249th anniversary and a declaration of independence from tyranny on July 4, Bolick's comments represent his most piercing and direct condemnation of actions taken by the country's highest political leaders. And while he stressed the criticism was \"neither partisan, nor ideological,\" the denunciation could open the justice up to retaliation from Trump allies or the president himself.\n\nBolick emphasized multiple threats in his speech, including Vice President JD Vance flippantly referring to \"due process\" on social media, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller threatening to suspend habeas corpus if judges didn't \"do the right thing.\" Habeas corpus protects against unlawful imprisonment.\n\nHe also chastised local threats to judicial independence, including a fierce campaign from the political left against his retention election in 2024, which focused on his decision to uphold an 1864 near-total abortion ban in Arizona.\n\nBolick is serving his final term on the Arizona Supreme Court and isn't in danger of losing his position. Arizona justices face mandatory retirement at age 70. But around the country, judges who have drawn the ire of Trump's allies have facedintimidation and threats of violence.\n\nAlready, Bolick's comments have prompted a response from one Trump ally, who said Bolick \"should stay out of the political arena.\"\n\nBolick acknowledged avoiding politics was a difficult line to walk as a justice who is trying to defend the courts. He was hesitant to sit for interviews with The Arizona Republic and initially declined in-person questions, citing concern about \"straying into political commentary.\"\n\nHe later agreed, noting the \"unprecedented attack\" on judiciary independence, and spoke with The Republic for several hours over three interviews.\n\n\"We have had very few instances where a president has threatened to ignore court decisions,\" Bolick said. \"Both the left and the right are attacking judges routinely referring to them as corrupt.\"\n\nAsked what a world without judicial independence would look like, Bolick offered an ominous warning.\n\n\"It looks like authoritarianism,\" he said.\n\nBolick's early career as a public interest attorney and special assistant at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was chairman of the commission at the time, shaped his appreciation for the American court system.\n\nBolick went to D.C. to fight affirmative action in 1985 but changed course after Thomas gave him advice. \"He said, 'Clint, the best way to get rid of affirmative action is by making it unnecessary and by fighting for empowerment options like freedom of enterprise and school choice,'\" Bolick told The Republic.\n\nBolick devoted his career to those ends, eventually co-founding the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm, and serving as vice president for litigation at the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank and law firm.\n\nOne of his noteworthy clients was a street corner shoeshine stand operator named Ego Brown. Brown employed homeless people and D.C. officials tried to shut him down, Bolick said. But the law used against Brown was a relic of the Jim Crow-era, when government officials targeted Black individuals by rendering their work unlawful or by imposing literacy tests or fees.\n\nBolick came out on top, and the law was \"the first economic regulationto be struck downas an equal protection violation in 50 years,\" he said.\n\nThe case showed him the power of the courts to right historical wrongs, keep government in check and create a level playing field for society's underdogs.\n\nThat appreciation for the judiciary's ability to level the playing field without political influence and help \"the little guy against the government\" has motivated Bolick to speak out.\n\n\"The judicial gavel is the ultimate equalizer in this country. We fight our battles from personal injury battles to constitutional battles in court rather than on the streets. And ... we won cases that we could never have won in a different country,\" Bolick said.\n\n\"It really is the American dream, and I think that an independent judiciary is really an underappreciated element of that,\" he said.\n\nBolick has pointed to a handful of threats against judiciary independence, both on the local and national levels: suspending habeas corpus, disregarding the importance of due process, threatening to ignore court orders and impeaching or voting out judges for unfavorable decisions.\n\nIn a column forReal Clear Politics in March, Bolick wrote that threats from \"people in powerful positions and their legal sycophants\" were intended to \"delegitimize and neutralize the courts’ vital role in our constitutional system.\"\n\nHe illustrated the stakes by referring to the 1944 landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that authorized Japanese internment. It was \"one of the great stains on our Constitutional jurisprudence,\" Bolick said. He cited the dissent fromJustice Robert Jacksonat the time, who wrote that the court \"validated ... racial discrimination in criminal procedure and of transplanting American citizens,\" which could be weaponized by any future administration who claims an \"urgent need.\"\n\n\"Sound familiar?\" Bolick said. \"These words were prescient in 1944.\" He called the ramifications for civil liberties \"absolutely breathtaking.\"\n\nHe did not name Vance or Miller by name duringhis speech in May,but he described the pitfalls of their positions and emphasized the risk — \"I don't have a problem with naming names, but the concern in personalizing the issue is that these are universal principles,\" he later told The Republic.\n\nVance, in April, hadtaken to social media and questioned due processfor undocumented migrants.\n\n\"To say the administration must observe 'due process' is to beg the question: what process is due is a function of our resources, the public interest, the status of the accused, the proposed punishment, and so many other factors,\" Vance wrote in part. It came after public backlash to the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign and mistaken deportation of a man to a notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\nBolick said flippantly referring to due process reflected the vulnerability of the rule of law.\n\n\"As if this concept was created by rogue liberal judges to help illegal immigrants stay in the country,\" Bolick said. \"Due process is the most foundational legal principle protecting individual liberty in Western civilization. It dates back to the Magna Carta. It does not deserve to be in quote marks.\"\n\nBolick said Miller's comment about potentially suspending habeas corpus if the courts didn't do the right thing could be seen as a way \"to intimidate the courts to reach decisions that they favor.\"\n\nMary Anne Franks, a legal scholar and left-leaning professor at George Washington University Law School, said Bolick's comments were \"really powerful, really well put.\"\n\n\"What's happening here is so far beyond politics. This is the difference between a country that obeys the rule of law and an authoritarian one,\" Franks said.\n\nIf people think they can look to their political affiliation to determine how they feel about these threats, what they are really doing is deciding if they like totalitarian rule and think they are going to be favored under such a system, she said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Harrison Fields did not directly respond to concerns expressed by Bolick in response to an inquiry from The Republic, but said, \"Attacks against public officials, including judges, have no place in our society and President Trump knows all too well the impact of callous attacks having faced two assassination attempts.”\n\nBolick also has highlighted threats to impeach federal judges for unfavorable decisions — a concern echoed also by former Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, who wrote a column in May titled,\"If Trump keeps threatening our judges, we'll lose our rule of law.\"\n\nBolick cited a comment made by Trump ally Mike Davis, who wasonce floated as a potential attorney general option.\n\nDavis said on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" show that Republican lawmakers needed to threaten the impeachment of judges who thwart Trump's agenda, noting it was \"important to have that Sword of Damocles over the judiciary's head.\"\n\nDavis, a former law clerk for now-Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who runs an organization called The Article III Project that claims to \"fight radical assaults on judicial independence,\" told The Republic he has never called for impeaching judges \"simply for unfavorable decisions.\"\n\n\"In very limited circumstances, we have called for the impeachment of judges who violate their judicial oaths with clearly lawless orders that endanger our national security. When judges take off their judicial robes, climb into the political arena, and throw political punches, they should expect political counterpunches,\" Davis said.\n\n\"Justice Clint Bolick should stay out of the political arena.\"\n\nBolick's criticism of local threats to judicial independence have focused on the campaign waged against him and another justice's 2024 retention after the 1864 abortion ban reinstatement. He doesn't pretend to equate the campaign against him to suspending habeas corpus or dismissing due process, but said, \"on an Arizona scale, it was potentially very significant.\"\n\n\"Disagreeing with the outcome of a decision was not intended to be a part of the retention process,\" Bolick said. His job in the case, he explained, was purely to interpret two conflicting state laws, not weigh in on constitutionality.\n\n\"I am unaware of a single credible criticism of the case,\"Bolick told The Republic.\n\nDJ Quinlan, chairman of the campaign against Bolick, said it was \"ridiculous\" to compare his effort to threats coming from the Trump administration because the Arizona Constitution gives voters the right to retention elections and voters had a right to vote however they saw fit.\n\nQuinlan rejected the idea that the campaign targeted Bolick simply for an unfavorable ruling — yes, the organizers disliked the ruling, but he explained that it was born out of the belief the Arizona Constitution protects abortion as a fundamental right to privacy.\n\nThat theory, echoed repeatedly by Kris Mayes during her campaign for attorney general in the 2022 election, has not been tested in the Arizona courts.\n\nBolick also pointed to the Maricopa County Republican Committee's 2024censure of the Arizona Supreme Court. The censure came after the high court declined to overturn the 2022 election results in Abe Hamadeh's race for attorney general against Mayes and authorized a defamation case against gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake to continue.\n\nCounty committee Chairman Craig Berland and First Vice Chairman Shelby Busch did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBolick does seem either hesitant to go too far with his warnings or uncertain how severe the threat is. \"This is virgin territory,\" he said.\n\nHe stopped short of saying he's concerned for democracy, opting to express his worry for maintaining a \"constitutional Republic\" instead. In other words, the United States could lose its judicial independence and still technically stay a democracy, it just wouldn't be what Americans are used to.\n\nHe referred to Mexico'srecent shift to judicial electionsto explain.\n\n\"They just switched to a system where judges are elected essentially on the same ticket as the national government. There is no question in my mind that that will be a very compliant judiciary,\" Bolick said. \"In a constitutional republic, we have a judicial check on the executive branch and that is what is at risk.\"\n\nWhile arguing that countries without independent judiciaries tend toward authoritarianism and raising the alarm over threats to judiciary independence in the United States, Bolick said he hasn't seen any \"overt leaps in that direction.\"\n\nHe was more conservative in his assessment of how far down the path the United States was toward authoritarianism, compared with other legal scholars.\n\nHe sees the threats in three stages. The United States, he said, was in the middle \"alarm stage\" — wading into the third but not quite there. He defined the final stage as the president ignoring judicial orders enforcing constitutional boundaries.\n\n\"That's where we would have, in my opinion, authoritarianism. Because if the president were allowed to operate unchecked, we would have what was a system of unbound executive power,\" Bolick said.\n\nOthers, such as Franks, think the country is in far worse shape.\n\n\"For the president to feel comfortable, and for basically everyone that he has placed around him to have power to say, 'We don't have to obey anything we don't want to,' ... that is authoritarianism. That is where we are,\" Franks said.\n\nShe, unlike Bolick, is worried judges already are capitulating to Trump — pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last summer to grant the president broad immunity from criminal prosecution for actions they take to carry out their official duties.\n\nWhether the country has enough \"institutional framework\" to combat that \"remains to be seen,\" she said.\n\nBolick's main hope is that judges maintain their duty to the Constitution, not public sentiment. At a time when judges face intimidation, he said, that act alone requires courage.\n\nFormer Arizona Supreme Court Justice Scott Bales said he shared \"Bolick's concern that we preserve independent courts as protectors of our constitutional liberties.\"\n\nFranks said she thinks the warnings were \"probably more compelling from a public opinion standpoint that it's coming from someone who isn't identified as a leftist liberal judge.\"\n\nNunziata said Bolick's warnings reflected a broader trend of the judiciary taking on the lion's share of work in defending the Constitution and limiting the government.\n\n\"Without a robust, independent judiciary and with a supine or compliant Congress, there's virtually no limit to what the government can do to take away our liberties,\" Nunziata said.\n\nTaylor Seely is a First Amendment Reporting Fellow at The Arizona Republic \/ azcentral.com.

    "News_title":"Major Rwandan coltan exporter bought smuggled Congolese minerals, UN report says",
    "News_text":"By Reade Levinson, David Lewis and Sonia Rolley\n\n, REUTERS -Rwandan company Boss Mining Solution bought minerals smuggled from rebel-held areas of neighboring Congo, helping fund an insurgency in that vast African country, according to a confidential report by a group of United Nations experts that was reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe U.N. report marks the first time the world body has named a company that’s purportedly complicit in trafficking minerals looted from Congo since M23 insurgents seized a key mining area there last year. Boss Mining was named in the U.N. report, which documents how recent territorial gains in Congo by M23 have further destabilized a region beset by decades of conflict. The heavily armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority, have been accused by the U.N. of plundering Congo’s natural resources and committing atrocities against civilians, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda.\n\nIllegal mining in M23-controlled areas and the smuggling of these minerals to Rwanda have “reached unprecedented levels,” the report said.\n\nThe report was submitted to the U.N. Security Council sanctions committee for Congo in early May and is due to be published soon, diplomats told Reuters.\n\nM23 did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoss Mining’s operations are run by Eddy Habimana, a Rwandan businessman, corporate records reviewed by Reuters show. U.N. investigators identified Habimana a decade ago as a minerals smuggler connected to rebels waging war in eastern Congo. Habimana declined to comment on the allegations in the unpublished U.N. Report.\n\nTwo Russia-born mining executives are also owners in Boss Mining, according to the Rwandan corporate records.\n\nYolande Makolo, Rwanda government spokesperson, told Reuters on Wednesday the U.N. report \"misrepresents Rwanda's longstanding security concerns\" about Hutu rebel groups that have attacked ethnic Tutsis in both Rwanda and Congo, a threat that \"necessitates the defense posture in our border areas.\"\n\nA Congolese government spokesman did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters, but Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) officials have repeatedly accused Rwanda of fomenting the conflict to plunder Congo's mineral wealth.\n\nSales from the mineral trade have been critical to funding M23’s rebellion. The insurgents this year swept across large swathes of eastern DRC that are home to the country’s largest coltan mine as well as mines producing gold, copper, tin and gemstones.\n\nA Reuters analysis of customs records from 2024 found that Boss Mining is one of a number of Rwandan companies that export significant volumes of coltan despite the fact that Rwanda produces little of the metallic ore. Rubaya, the Congolese mining area now controlled by M23, produces 15% of the world’s coltan. The ore is processed into a heat-resistant metal called tantalum that’s in high demand from makers of mobile phones, computers and other applications in the electronics, aerospace and medical industries.\n\nEarly this year, M23 insurgents seized the Congolese border cities of Bukavu and Congo, giving them control of two key crossings into Rwanda. It is through these cities that smuggled Congolese minerals are trucked to Rwanda, often at night “to avoid detection,” according to the forthcoming U.N. report. The report said 195 tons came across in the last week of March alone. Some of the smuggled minerals were purchased by Boss Mining, the report said.\n\nIn previous text messages to Reuters in June responding to questions about Boss Mining’s operations, Habimana said his company has “never been involved in purchasing coltan from Rubaya.”\n\n“All materials we buy are in compliance\" with international guidelines meant to ensure that mining isn't used to fund armed groups or contribute to human rights abuses, he said.\n\nM23’s lightning advance in eastern Congo has re-ignited a decades-old conflict that has its origins in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide and has displaced millions of people. The rebels have vowed to overthrow the Congolese government.\n\nRwanda’s government has long denied that it traffics in coltan looted from its neighbor or that it backs M23. But Rwanda’s ruling party, mainly headed by Tutsis, shares the same concerns as the Tutsi-dominated M23 insurgents over the purported threat posed by rival Hutu groups operating in eastern Congo. As of April, Rwanda had at least 1,000 troops in Congo, according to the confidential U.N. report.\n\nOn Friday, Rwanda and Congo signed a U.S.-brokered peace agreement that aims to arrange for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from Congo’s territory. The accord does not include M23. The rebel group is part of a separate, parallel mediation led by Qatar that seeks to end hostilities. The success of those talks is key to any lasting peace.\n\nMURKY SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nA Reuters analysis of customs records found Boss Mining in 2024 exported at least 150 metric tons of coltan worth $6.6 million. The figure accounted for 6.5% of total Rwandan exports of coltan in 2024, making Boss Mining the country’s sixth-largest exporter of the ore last year.\n\nBoss Mining does not mine any of its own coltan but purchases it from another Rwandan company, Speck Minerals, as well as from other sellers, according to a Boss Mining employee who asked not to be identified, saying he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nBoss Mining has a mining concession in Rwanda's Burera district where it mines wolframite, another mineral, according to the employee and an online database from the Rwanda Mining Board. That area does not have major coltan mining sites, according to maps of mineral deposits in Rwanda and mining industry press.\n\nHabimana is also the listed company representative of Speck Minerals, according to the Rwanda Mining Association and Rwandan mining industry press reports. The phone number provided is the same number that Habimana uses for Boss Mining, according to a 2024 Rwanda Mining Association publication. The Boss Mining employee told Reuters that Speck operates two mines in the Gakenke and Muhanga districts of Rwanda that produce a combined 18 tons of coltan monthly.\n\nA 2018 audit of the Muhanga mine conducted by a Thai smelter lists the mine site name as Speck Minerals and Eddy Habimana as the site owner. The audit listed the monthly production at the time as 2.3 tons of coltan.\n\nResponding last month to Reuters’ questions about Boss Mining, Habimana in text messages described the two mining concessions in Muhanga and Gakenke as part of Boss Mining's operations.\n\nReuters was unable to verify the current production at either mine.\n\nHabimana did not answer questions about Speck or the employee’s assertions about production.\n\nU.N. investigators, non-governmental organizations and mining industry sources have accused M23 rebels and their Rwandan backers of profiting from the illicit trade of minerals smuggled from Congo for over a decade.\n\nThe scale of the trade reached new levels after M23 captured Rubaya and established a parallel administration controlling mining activities, trade, transport and the taxation of the minerals produced there, according to a U.N. report published in December 2024. Reuters reporters visited Rubaya in March this year and were told by M23 officials that the rebels had imposed a tax on mineral traders of 15% on the value of coltan they purchase from informal miners who work the area.\n\nThe 2024 U.N. report said the rebels, by seizing Rubaya, had ensured that they could maintain exclusive control over the critical supply chain of minerals, while making Rwanda “the sole transit market for these minerals.”\n\nThe smuggled Congolese coltan is mixed with Rwandan production before export, making it virtually impossible to trace its origin, then sold to smelters supplying global technology manufacturers, U.N. experts said.\n\nThe resulting mingling of Congolese and Rwandan coltan production was “the most important contamination of supply chains” to date, the U.N. said. M23 was taking in $800,000 monthly from taxes collected from coltan mining in eastern Congo, according to the 2024 report.\n\nOfficial statistics on Rwanda’s coltan production are unreliable, mining experts say. The country’s central bank suspended publication of export figures in May 2024, shortly after M23 seized Rubaya.\n\nA Reuters analysis of customs records showed that Rwanda exported at least 2,300 tons of coltan ore last year.\n\nEleven mining experts and geologists who work in the region told Reuters that Rwanda exports far more coltan than the country actually produces. Many of them have visited mines in both countries and say the scale of mine sites and the number of miners in Rwanda are dwarfed by those in Congo.\n\n“It’s totally implausible that Rwanda can generate that level of output,\" UK-based mineral consultant Bill Millman said of Rwanda’s 2024 coltan exports.\n\nRwanda’s government did not comment on its coltan production.\n\nThe DRC severed diplomatic relations with Rwanda in January after M23 seized the Congolese city of Goma. Congo’s military has struggled to contain repeated Rwanda-backed rebellions. But even in peacetime Kigali has long benefited from the corruption and weak regulation in the minerals trade that fuels smuggling from Congo.\n\nRUSSIAN CONNECTION\n\nRwandan company records reviewed by Reuters show that Boss Mining was set up in 2013 and is one-third owned by Habimana, the managing director who denied purchasing Congolese coltan.\n\nThose records show that Boss Mining has two other owners: Yuriy Tolmatchev and Alexander Konovalchik. Both men have dual British and Russian citizenship and have been in the mining industry for decades, according to UK and Russian corporate records and Russian mining industry press reports. They now live and work in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe two men also own other companies that buy up the coltan supplied by Boss Mining, according to the corporate records reviewed by Reuters.\n\nIn addition, they are directors of a Cyprus company, Metarex Ltd, Cyprus corporate records show. Metarex, in turn, is the 100% owner of Novacore FZE, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, according to UAE corporate records provided by the corporate intelligence firm Diligencia.\n\nNovacore is managed by Tolmatchev and purchases all of Boss Mining’s coltan, according to the corporate records and a Reuters analysis of customs records.\n\nTolmatchev did not comment on Novacore’s purchases. He said Boss Mining is the smallest coltan exporter in Rwanda, but declined to provide more information.\n\n“I have no idea how local traders do business in North Kivu,” he said, referring to the Congo province that is home to the Rubaya coltan mine.\n\nAsked about the U.N. report that Boss Mining buys minerals smuggled from Congo, Tomaltchev said the company did not purchase material that originated in Congo.\n\nHis partner, Konovalchik, had no comment on the U.N. report. He told Reuters that all of Boss Mining’s minerals are purchased “from Rwandan sources.” He referred follow-up questions to Habimana. “I’m not controlling day by day operations,” he said.\n\n(Reporting by Reade Levinson in London, David Lewis in Nairobi and Sonia Rolley in Paris.

    "News_text":"Top-rankingFood and Drug Administrationofficials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.\n\nIn amemorandumfollowing Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.\n\nPrasad was namedearlier this yearto replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad waslater elevatedto the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.\n\nNovavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.\n\nPrasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"\n\n\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.\n\nAseparate memoreleased by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.\n\nThe agency's career scientists had initially concludedon April 1that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.\n\n\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.\n\nDocumentsreleasedlast month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.\n\n\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.\n\nUnder Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.\n\n\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had saidat an eventlast year.\n\nIn past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, whoquestioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials — Dr. Phil Krause — is alsonow criticizingmoves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.\n\nAgency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.\n\nMonths before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.\n\nHoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"\n\n\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political — it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.\n\nMakary and Prasad also made this argumentin May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.\n\n\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.\n\nThe FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.\n\nHealth care providers are also allowed to give vaccines \"off-label\" outside of the FDA's label and CDC recommendations, once the FDA has approved sales, though that risks running afoul of insurance coverage and liability protections.\n\nSeveral people missing from Texas summer camp amid deadly flooding, officials say\n\nWhat a new DOJ memo could mean for naturalized U.S. citizens\n\nJuly 4 holiday week expected to set record for travelers",

    "News_text":"The rise of plant-based products and the arrival of cell-cultured options as meat alternatives are trends very much on the radar of the world's largest meat companies.\n\nHere we look at what those businesses are doing to make sure they are not missing out on alternative protein solutions.\n\nThe Brazil-based meat titan has had an up-and-down record in alternatives to conventional meat.\n\nIn the spring of 2019, JBS, the world's largest beef processor, unveiled a plant-based version of a burger for the first time.\n\nJBSlaunched the vegan product under one of its flagship Brazilian brands, Seara. The company saidthe Incrível Burger Seara Gourmetburger contained soy, beets, wheat, garlic and onion.\n\nIn March 2020, JBS announced it would launch plant-based protein brand Ozo in the USvia a new subsidiary, Planterra Foods. Burgers were among the products to be rolled out.\n\nHowever, two-and-a-half years later, the companyannounced it was to close Planterraand “focus its efforts on its plant-based operations in Brazil and Europe, which continue to gain market share and expand their respective customer bases”.\n\nIn Europe, JBS is present in plant-based meat through its ownership ofDutch business Vivera, which it acquired in 2021.\n\nIn November of that year, JBS announced ittaken a stake in Spain-based cultivated meat firm BioTech Foods.\n\nJBS announced in September 2023 that it hadstarted construction work on an R&D sitethat will develop cell-based protein, marking its latest investment in the early-stage industry.\n\nIn March 2025, the groupannouncedit had struck a deal to buy The Vegetarian Butcher brand from Unilever, which had owned the Dutch plant-based business since 2018.\n\nA major supplier of meat products, Plukon Food Group operates across 40 locations in seven countries across Europe. In 2024, the company reported a turnover of €3.4bn ($3.87bn) and employed 11,000 staff.\n\nIn June 2025, the Netherlands-based companyannounced the acquisitionof local vegan and vegetarian products business Vega Insiders.\n\nIn a statement announcing the transaction Plukon Food Group CEO Kees Kraijenoord said: “This acquisition fits perfectly within our strategy. Plukon has been working on alternative protein concepts for years.\"\n\nVega Insiders specialises in fresh and frozen products such as vegan minced meat, bacon and cheese bites. The products are sold to retail and foodservice customers.\n\nTönnies Group is one of the largest meat processors in Germany, offering pork, beef and convenience products.\n\nSet up in 1971, the family-owned company's \"core business\" centres on the slaughter, butchering, processing and refining of pigs, sows and cattle. In 2022, the group's turnover stood at €6.82bn, with its workforce at 15,200 worldwide.\n\nHowever, Tönnies has interests in meat alternatives, with its Zur Mühlen Gruppe subsidiary active in the sector.\n\nZur Mühlen Gruppe, home to meat brands including Böklunder and Eberswalder, also markets meat-free products under brands including Vevia 4 You and a meat brand, Gutfried.\n\nIn 2024, the companyannounced it had invested in Nosh, a Berlin-based ingredients firm.\n\nNosh uses fermentation to make non-GMO fungi to use as an ingredient in meat analogues and alternative-seafood products. The company says the ingredient can also be used in bakery, dairy, confectionery and pet food.\n\nThe US meat giant, one of the largest companies in the sector, has perhaps done more than any of its rivals to position itself in alternatives to its core product.\n\nTyson Foodspreviously invested in US plant-based burger firmBeyond Meatand has backed two lab-based meat firms –Memphis Meatsfrom the US andFuture Meat Technologies.\n\nIn May 2018, itco-led a US$2.2m seed investment round in the Israeli firmthrough its Tyson Ventures arm.\n\nIt described the target of its investment as a \"ground-breaking start-up developing affordable, non-GMO technology for cultured meat production\". Future Meat Technologies is a Jerusalem-based biotechnology company advancing a distributive manufacturing platform for cost-efficient, non-GMO production of meat directly from animal cells, without the need to raise or harvest animals.\n\nThe investment built on its previouslytaking a minority stake in US-based Memphis Meats, again through its Tyson Ventures arm. Memphis Meats, based in the San Francisco Bay area and since renamed Upside Foods, said it planned to use the new funds to accelerate product development.\n\nIn April 2019, it emerged Tyson had exited its investment in US firm Beyond Meat, ahead of the Beyond Burger maker's IPO.\n\nIn June that year, Tyson launched a brand – Raised & Rooted – in the US,under which plant-based products and so-called 'blended' food (containing meat and plant ingredients) were sold. By the autumn of 2020, the company rolled out the brand to Europe,targeting the foodservice market.\n\nIn December 2020, Tyson announced it wasmaking changes to the Raised & Rooted plant-based range it sells in the US– including pulling the hybrid burger on offer since the brand's launch last year.\n\nTyson started 2021 with the unveiling of plant-based breakfast patties under its Jimmy Dean brand,products it said would help meet demand for meat-free options at breakfast.\n\nIn June of that year, the company continued its push into meat alternativeslaunched its first plant-based meat brand in Asia.\n\nAnother Brazil-based meat major,Marfrig,announced in August 2019plans to enter the plant-based category in an exclusive tie-up withArcher Daniels Midland.\n\nADM produces the base raw materials while Marfrig manufactures and sells the end products.\n\nMarfrig'smeat-free burgers - sold under the Revolution brand - launched in December 2019 and since then theyhave largely been targeted at the foodservice market where they are sold by the likes of fast-food giant Burger King and local chain Outback Steakhouse, which brands its meat-free offering the Aussie Plant Burger and sells it for around US$8.\n\nIn November 2021, the Marfrig-ADM venture, PlantPlus Foods, announced a pair of acquisitions in the sector. The JVsnapped up Sol Cuisine in Canada and Chicago-based Hilary’s for a joint consideration of US$140m.\n\nAnother Brazil-based meat giant has invested in alternatives to the conventional industry.\n\nIn the plant-based area,BRFmarkets products under its Sadia Veg & Tal brand, while the company has a contract withAleph Farms, an Israel-based start-up focusing on cell-cultured meat.\n\nTheir tie-up, announced in March 2021, will see the companies work together on developing cell-based meat for sale in Brazil. \"BRF is ready and charged to play a leading role in this food revolution and be an active participant in one the greatest industry transformations of this generation,\"Lorival Luz, the CEO of BRF, said at the time.\n\nIn July 2021,BRF invested in Aleph Farms as part of a US$105m funding round. Its contribution was $2.5m.\n\nUS agri-food giantCargillhas alsobacked 'clean' meat companyMemphis Meats.\n\nIn August 2017, Cargill joined a wide group of investors including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Virgin founder Richard Branson in a Series A fundraising round in the business, which has since been renamed Upside Foods.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide a complete basket of goods to our customers. We will do this by growing our traditional protein business, entering into new proteins and investing in innovative alternatives,\" Brian Sikes, group leader of Cargill's protein business, said at the time.\n\nCargill has continued to invest in conventional meat products but, alongside building that side of its business, has backed others offering alternatives. In May 2019, it was announced Cargillhad also become an investor inAleph Farms.\n\nIn February 2020, Cargillannounced it would launch its own meat-free patties and ground products aimed at the private-label and foodservice channels.\n\nCanada'sMaple Leaf Foodshas also been busy in meat alternatives.\n\nIn February 2017, it moved toacquire US plant-based protein manufacturerLightlife Foodsfrom private-equity firm Brynwood Partners for US$140m.\n\nAnnouncing the deal, Maple Leaf claimed the acquisition establishes it as a \"leader\" in the US plant-based protein category through the Lightlife brand, which offers refrigerated products such as plant-based hot dogs, breakfast foods and burgers.\n\nAnd it built on this in December 2017 when it entered an agreement tobuy US-basedField Roast Grain Meat Co.for US$120m.\n\nSeattle-based Field Roast supplies grain-based meat and vegan cheese products to the North American market. Its range includes sausages, frankfurters, burgers and deli slices.\n\nIn 2018, Maple Leaf created Greenleaf Foods, a new division to head the acquired Lightlife and Field Roast Grain Meat assets. In 2020, through Greenleaf, Maple Leafinvested inGathered Foods, the US company behind the plant-based seafood brand Good Catch.\n\nHowever, by 2021, the company was warning about the level of sales seen in the wider category. In November that year, Maple Leafannounced a review of its plant-protein business after a third quarter of declining sales. Three months later, the group said it would “recalibrate” its investment in the division to “align with the market opportunity”.\n\nItadded: “The [financial] results to date confirm that the very high category growth rates previously predicted by many industry experts are unlikely to be achieved given current customer feedback, experience, buy rates and household penetration.”\n\nIn 2022, Maple Leaf emerged as an investor inEvolved Foods, a Canada-based outfit developing cell-cultivated meat.\n\nPreviously trading as CaroMeats, Evolved Meatsannouncedit had raised CAD2m (US$1.5m) in seed funding, with Big Idea Ventures, an alternative-protein venture fund and accelerator that has invested in plant-based and cell-cultured protein start-ups, joining Maple Leaf in the round.\n\nIn February 2024, Maple Leaf revealed it was tomerge its meat and plant-based protein businessesafter breaking even in its meat-free division.\n\nIt revealed the reorganisation alongside its full-year results for 2023, when, in the fourth quarter, it achieved its goal from 2022 “to deliver neutral, or better, adjusted EBITDA within the next 18 months” in its plant protein division.\n\nSales from the division, however, fell in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole.\n\nThe US-based meat supplier - with more than 60 facilities across 17 countries - announced in July 2019 a deal to produce the Impossible Burger, the flagship product of another Californian plant-based upstart,Impossible Foods.\n\nThe contract added capacity to Impossible's own plant in Oakland, California. It came as Impossible claimed it had seen \"unprecedented demand\" for the burger, which made its debut in selected restaurants in 2016.\n\nFurther south in Mexico,Sigma Alimentos, one of the country's largest suppliers of meat and dairy products, has invested in plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nIn 2021, the company announced it had acquired a minority stake inThe Live Green Co.(TLGC),a Chile-based supplier of plant-based meat and dairy products.\n\nSigma described TLGC as \"one of the most exciting plant-based start-ups in Latin America\". The Santiago-based firm, set up in 2018, has a product range that includes plant-based burger and pancake mixes, as well as ice cream.\n\nThe company has also made moves in plant-based meat via its Spain-based businessCampofrio Food Group.\n\nCampofrio announced its first move into the plant-based protein category in June 2020.\n\nThe move came three years after it launched its Campofrío Vegalia unit with the aim of \"responding to the needs of the vegetarian or flexitarian consumer\".\n\nThe Madrid-based company launched a vegan burger made with ingredients including soy and pea vegetable protein, mushrooms and sunflower oil.\n\nMagic Burger is made at the Campofrío Frescos plant in Burgos.\n\nThe world's largest food maker, whichowns a minority stake in European meats business Hertaand buys in meat for a variety of ready meals and convenience-food products, has a growing presence in the market for meat alternatives.\n\nIn September 2017, the companyentered the US market for plant-based food with the acquisition of Sweet Earth.\n\nIn Europe,Nestlé's has made a series of moves to try to tap into growing demand for plant-based alternatives to meat.\n\nIn the spring of 2018, the company launched the Garden Gourmet brand in the UK but, by April 2019,had confirmed the product was no longer on sale in that market.\n\nApril 2019 also saw Nestlélaunch the Incredible Burger under the Garden Gourmet brand in select European markets.\n\nIn June 2020, Nestlélost a trademark spat with US plant-based burger maker Impossible Foodsand was forced to drop the Incredible Burger name, adopting the designation of the Sensational Burger instead.\n\nIn Australia, the Swiss giant markets its plant-based meat products under the name Harvest Gourmet, which was launched in that market in 2019.\n\nThe Harvest Gourmet brand waslaunched in China in the autumn of 2020.\n\nIn July 2021, Nestlé confirmed it was \"evaluating innovative technologies to produce cultured meat or cultured-meat ingredients with several external partners and start-ups\".\n\nNestlé said an example was its work with Israeli cell-based meat start-upFuture Meat Technologies. The company said it was partnering with Future Meat Technologies to \"explore the potential of cultured-meat components that do not compromise on taste or sustainability\".\n\nFour months later, the companytook part in the seed fundingofSundial Foods, a US start-up developing a vegan alternative to chicken wings.\n\nIn April 2022, the Australia-based meat and seafood processor, which serves retail customers worldwide, announced it had joined a project to develop a plant-based protein and foods hub in the country.\n\nThomas Foods International (TFI), a processor of lamb, mutton, beef, goat and seafood, will build meat-alternative and plant-based extraction facilities in Australia.\n\nAt the time, Darren Thomas, TFI’s managing director,said in a statement: “For Thomas Foods International, we see plant-based protein as a natural complement to our traditional product offering and allows us to reach new markets and customers.\n\n“The market for plant-based products is also expanding rapidly and we see great opportunity to leverage our experience and expertise into this exciting new opportunity for local farmers and consumers across the globe.”\n\nIn 2023, France-based charcuterie supplierFleury Michonentered the plant-based meat sector through a partnership with Planted, a Swiss specialist.\n\nThe two companies launched a range of mince-type products in France. They secured listings at retailers including Carrefour, Intermarché and Casino.\n\nSwitzerland-based food groupOrioris home to meat brands including Albert Speiss and Fredag.\n\nHowever, the listed company also has interests in the meat-free market. The business' product range includes the Happy Vegi Butcher brand under which it markets products including nuggets, chunks and a soy-based alternative to kebab meat.\n\nIn July 2025, another of Orior's meat-focused businesses – the pie and terrine maker Le Patron – announced it was teaming up with Swiss start-up Yumame Foods.\n\nThe companies will work together to develop plant-based foods based on the fermentation techniques developed by Yumame Foods. Le Patron said the products made by Yumame Foods were \"characterised by a high nutritional value and minimal processing\".\n\n\"We complement these strengths with our many years of experience in the production of culinary specialties, our production facilities and direct access to the retail trade and foodservice,\" Orior's Le Patron business unit posted on LinkedIn. \"Together, we combine the best of two worlds: pioneering spirit and reliability.\"\n\nThe Nordic meat processor's presence in meat-free includes the manufacturing and marketing of meat-free products under its Pärsons brand in Sweden in 2016.\n\nIn November 2019, the company teamed up withHes-Pro (Finland)to develop plant-based protein products, with the first foods from that partnership launched the following autumn under the HK Vihreät brand.\n\nIn May 2020, the thenHKScanexpanded further into the plant-based market with a joint venture with Finland-based private bakery businessLeivon Leipomo. Six months later, the group inked a deal to sellApetit'splant-based products in the Swedish foodservice channel, with distribution starting in February 2021.\n\nThat same month, HKScan said it wanted to continue tobuild its presence in the market for plant-based alternatives.\n\nAnother Swiss business, the packaged meats supplierBell Food Group, has also invested in lab-grown meat.\n\nIn July 2018, the convenience food supplierinvested EUR2m (US$2.4m) inMosa Meat, a cultured-beef start-up based in the Netherlands.\n\n\"The objective of the upcoming development phase is to successfully bring cultured beef to market by 2021,\" Bell said. \"The Bell Food Group supports the development and research work [at Mosa Meat] with its expertise and know-how as one of the leading producers of meat and charcuterie products in Europe.\"\n\nMosa Meat also attracted investment from M Ventures, the corporate venture capital arm of science and technology company Merck.\n\nBell has invested further in Mosa Meat since,most recently in July 2020.\n\nThe company also has plant-based meat alternatives in its product range. Bell sells products in Switzerland and Germany, marketing plant-based options under its The Green Mountain brand.\n\nIn October 2018, the UK-based meat processorHilton Food Groupstruck a deal to buy 50% ofDalco Food, a supplier of vegetarian products in the Netherlands.\n\nThe transaction, agreed for an undisclosed sum, gives Hilton an option to buy the rest of Dalco Food in 2024.\n\nAccording to the Dalco Food website, the company started life as a butcher's shop in the centre of Oss, a city in the east of the Netherlands, in 1975.\n\nDalco Food's product line includes meat substitutes such as vegetarian burgers. It also includes products like chicken nuggets and meatballs.\n\nThe business' customer base takes in retailers on a private-label basis, the foodservice channel and food manufacturers.\n\nIn September 2023, Hilton announced it wasconsolidating its factory operations for meat-alternativesas a proactive measure against the “market restructure” in the category.\n\nIt said it planned to close its Dutch facility in the city of Oss and move production of meat-free sausages, chicken and burgers – marketed internationally – to Hilton’s remaining site in the country based at Oosterhout.\n\nIn April 2024, CEO Steve MurrellstoldJust Food: “We remain a fan of that sector. It remains an important market for our partners around the world.\n\n“Two of the reasons why I think there’s a global resetting in this marketplace was around how do we make it more affordable for more people and how do we improve the experience around taste and flavour.”\n\nHilton Food has now “started to rightsize the business”, he said.\n\nIn the autumn of 2019, US-based meat and seafood supplierRastelli Foods Groupwas signed up byMoving Mountainsas the UK-based meat-free business' importer and \"key distributor\" in the country.\n\nAt the end of the year, Rastelli Foods Group alsoagreed to act as US distributor for UK meat-free start-upDaring Foods.\n\nIn February 2020, Daring Foods is also planning to launch a direct-to-consumer service in the US in February supported by Rastelli Foods.\n\nIn November 2017, Dutch frozen snack companyIzico Food Group, which includes chicken skewers, mini burgers and meat croquettes in its range, added to its business in the UK with theacquisition of vegetarian foods supplierGoodlife Foods.\n\nGoodlife's range includes vegetarian sausages and burgers supplied to the retail and foodservice channels.\n\nIzico, which manufactures branded and private-label frozen food products, also has its own range of vegetarian and vegan products.\n\nIt said the \"addition of Goodlife confirms the organisation's strategy to develop their UK business going forward and to cement their position as a leading supplier in their chosen categories''.\n\nThe company, one of Europe's largest poultry processors, has made – or been involved in – a number of investments in businesses offering meat alternatives.\n\nIn January 2018, PHW formed a strategicpartnership with Israeli 'clean meat' businessSuperMeat. It provided financing that will enable the Tel Aviv-based, bio-tech start-up to bring its \"clean-chicken products'' to market.\n\nSuperMeat produces meat by growing cells extracted from chickens. The cells are then grown in conditions that allow them to thrive, forming poultry cuts.\n\nSuperMeat said of its business: \"This process puts an end to the industrial need to mass produce animals for slaughter, while eliminating exposure to animal waste and food-borne illnesses; the potential benefits for public health and animal welfare are therefore considerable.\"\n\nIn September 2019, PHW was part of a consortiuminvesting in Israel-based 3D printer alternative meat producing firmRedefine Meat.\n\nIn February 2020,Foods United, a US-based business set up to invest in the plant-based market,bought a majority stake in German vegan businessLikeMeat. PHW-Gruppe owns a minority stake in Foods United.\n\nA month later, Foods United was renamedThe LiveKindly Collectiveafter acquiring plant-based digital media platform, LiveKindly Media. The LiveKindly Collective also has South Africa-based businessThe Fry Family Food Co.in its portfolio, as well as the Nordic brandOumph, which wasacquired from Sweden's Food For Progress in the summer of 2020.\n\nIn 2021, The Livekindly Collectivesnapped upNo Meat, the branded alternative-protein line owned by UK frozen-food retailer Iceland Foods. The same year, the company also bought Amsterdam-basedThe Dutch Weed Burger, which makes alt-meat products from seaweed.\n\nIn October 2020, meanwhile, PHWlaunched its own vegan brand, Green Legend.\n\nAnother investor in The Livekindly Collective is South Africa'sRCL Foods, a major local supplier of poultry products.\n\nRCL, the owner of the Rainbow chicken brand, invested in The Livekindly Collective in January 2020, acquiring a minority shareholding. Terms have not been disclosed.\n\nA year later, RCL and The Livekindly Collectiveannounced the formation of a joint venture to market the latter's products in South Africa and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe venture, Livekindly Collective Africa, was launched in May 2021 and is markets the US firm's brands, including Fry’s, Oumph and Like Meat, in the region.\n\nNorway'sNorturais among those meat companies to have launched their own ranges of meat-free products. In 2017, Norturalaunched a line of vegetarian alternatives to meatcalled MEATish.\n\nThe line included MEATish bowls, nuggets, bites and burgers. It is made from GMO-free soy beans and Norwegian eggs. The company said the products have \"equivalent or higher\" protein and less saturated fat than meat options.\n\nNortura said at the time it is one of \"several\" vegetable-based projects it is working on.\n\nIn 2015, German meat processorWiesenhofcontinued its push into meat-free withthe launch of two vegan products.\n\nThe company, which already sold vegetarian lines under its Paul's Veggie brand, introduced a vegan sausage and a vegan mortadella - an Italian sausage. The products are made with pea and soy protein.\n\nWiesenhof pointed to data from the Vegetarierbund, Germany's vegetarian association, that it said showed 10% of German consumers are vegetarians.\n\nIn early 2019, the sausage, bacon and ham supplier, based in Northern Ireland, opened a new facility to make vegetarian and vegan products.\n\nAnnouncing the investment, managing director Brian McMonagle said: \"We are determined not to stand still and are always looking to make food the best it can possibly be, without being bound by the way it's always been done.\n\n\"More and more people are switching to a vegan or vegetarian diet – and even meat eaters are increasingly seeking a day or two off a week.\"\n\nInMay 2020, Finnebrogue aunched a new plant-based range, consisting of Naked 'made without the moo' burgers, meatballs and mince products and Naked 'made without the oink' sausages.\n\nIn July 2025, Canada-based meat supplier Sofina Foodsannounced it had acquired Finnebrogue.\n\nIn April 2018,The Black Farmer, a UK food business best known for sausages and other meat products, launched The Hatchery, a collaborative incubator for food entrepreneurs.\n\nThe firstcohort was made up of three businesses, one of which is London-based Planet Jasonwhich makes vegan burgers and sausages. meatless mince and chicken-type products.\n\nIreland-based meat processorABP Food Groupannounced it wasmoving into the plant-based arena in February 2019.\n\nThe County Louth business launched its first fresh plant-based, meat-free brand for distribution in the UK.\n\nIts brand is called Equals and is being sold through major UK retailers including Asda.\n\nThe company said the move was part of its \"multi-million pound\" investment in branded and ready-to-cook meat and meat-free products which complement its core processing business.\n\nEquals' launch product was a pack of two meat-free quarterpounder burgers, made from a mix of seasoned pea and soy proteins.\n\nThe brand was delisted and, in 2021, ABP launched another brand, Dopsu, in the UK. ABProlled out a range of frozen products under the Dopsu brand, which was a portmanteau of the words doppelganger and substitute.\n\nIn August 2019, Denmark-based co-opDanish Crownannounced it was to launch plant-based products.\n\nThe company said it would be ready to introduce plant-based alternatives to beef burgers before the end of the year.\n\nFinn Klostermann, CEO of Danish Crown Beef, said: \"Danish Crown Beef already has several hybrid products composed of minced beef and root vegetables in the chilled cabinets, they will soon be joined by products made entirely of plants. Before the end of the year a plant-based burger will be a part of our product range.\"\n\nKlostermann said the co-op was responding to consumer demand.\n\nIn autumn 2020, Danish Crown confirmed it had acquired a stake in a local business making steak products targeted at flexitarians and vegetarians.\n\nThe company invested inINFoods, a new business set up by the founders of DK-Foods,the Danish pepperoni manufacturer Danish Crown acquired in 2018.\n\nUS-basedHormel Foodslaunched a meat alternative brand in the shape of Happy Little Plantsin September 2019.\n\nThe Austin, Minnesota-based branded food company - behind products such as Skippy, Spam and Applegate - announced the launch at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston.\n\nIt said the initiative, mooted back in June, is the first project under its Cultivated Foods umbrella.\n\nIt had previously launched blended meat and vegetable products.\n\nNetherlands-based meat businessVion Food Groupannounced in October 2019 it was to establish an arm manufacturing plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nME-AT was to provide products on a private label basis to retailers, most likely in its home market and in Germany.\n\nThere were no plans to bring out branded products using the ME-AT label.\n\nVion did not disclose which proteins will be used in its five planned products.\n\nIreland'sKepakis another company to seek to tap into the interest in vegetarian brands.\n\nIn January 2020, Kepak announced it wasrolling out a vegetarian product under its ready-to-cook burger brand Rustlers.\n\nThe Rustlers Moroccan Vegetarian Burger - which had a recommended retail price of GBP2 (US$2.60 at the prevailing exchange rate) - is made with chickpeas, carrot and coriander. Every Rustlers comes with a sachet of sauce and the veggie product is sold with mango chutney and a yogurt-and-mint sauce.\n\nIn October 2021, Kepak launched a product it described as a “meat mimicking” burger.\n\nMade with pea protein and launched under the company's Rustlers brand, the Meatless Maverick burger was launched at Tesco stores and at the retailer's One Stop and Booker outlets.\n\n“The meat-free movement has rapidly accelerated growth of the category, which is being driven by flexitarians as consumers seek more balance in their diets,” Adrian Lawlor, Kepak's chief marketing officer, said at the time.\n\n“It’s important for a brand like Rustlers which has built its success on meeting clear consumer needs to recognise this trend and provide solutions to meet it. For meat reducers, Meatless Maverick provides an easy swap while behaviourally fitting existing habits, therefore requiring less of a conscious shift.”\n\nIn the spring of 2020, the Japanese group, home to businesses including Nippon Ham, was announced as among a group of investors taking part in a Series A round of funding inIntegriCulture, a Japanese firm developing cell-based foods.\n\nA spokesperson forNH Foodstold just-food at the time: \"By strengthening the collaboration through this investment, we will accelerate technological research for the realisation of clean meat and verification of future business possibilities. IntegriCulture is a start-up company that has useful technology in developing clean meat and is actively taking on the challenge of market creation.\"\n\nIntegriCulture's key aims are to bring cell-based foie gras to market in 2021 and processed meat in 2023. It hopes to then start marketing cell-based beef in 2025.\n\nThe Danish manufacturer, which sells a range of meat products, also offers organic, meat-free meals and, in 2020, stepped up its presence in the market for meat alternatives by acquiring local plant-based ready-meals manufacturerFairdig.\n\nCees Kuypers, the commercial director and co-owner ofHanegal,said at the time: \"The acquisition is strategically important to us as we thereby strengthen our position in plant-based ready meals. The acquisition gives us a good starting point for further expansion - and especially in the frozen category and in export markets where Lise-Lotte has extensive experience.\"\n\nThe Nordic chicken group, formed in 2013 by private-equity house CapVest through the combination of processors Kronfågel and Cardinal Foods, owns poultry brands across western Europe.\n\nIn the autumn of 2020,Scandi Standardannounced a plan to work with local food-development firm Veg of Lund in R&D projects centring on plant-based protein.\n\nCentury Pacific Food, a meat and seafood products manufacturer in the Philippines, moved into alt-meat in 2020.\n\nThe publicly-listed business started off with plant-based burgers, which were rolled out in the company's foodservice operation – Shakey's Pizza Asia Ventures – in October.\n\nCentury Pacific then launched a brand, UnMeat,into the country's retail sector.\n\nIn May 2021, the Thailand-based pork and poultry heavyweight unveiled plant-based brand Meat Zero and announced an ambition for it to become a top-three alt-meat brand globally within five years.\n\nOn its way to that goal, Charoen Pokphand Foods wants the brand to be the top alternative meat brand in Asia \"within 2022\".\n\nFive months later, CPF announcedthe acquisition of 50% of Poland-based Well Well, which manufactures a range of plant-based meat substitutes.\n\nMiddle East manufacturerAl Islami Foodsmade its meat-free debut with the launch of a plant-based burger in January 2021.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates-based company, one of the largest frozen food companies in the region, said it had launched the product in response to the growing appetite for healthier vegan options and in time for Veganuary, a global campaign that encourages people to try a plant-based diet in the New Year.\n\nIts burger is made using sunflower protein, fava beans and peas and is the first in a series of plant-based products that the company planned to roll out.\n\nIn 2021, the California-based beef processorbroke ground on a dedicated facility for meat alternativesdue to be operational in April that year.\n\nThe project came under a year after Gregg and Jeff Hamann, who have ownedJensen Meat Co.since 2011,acquired a controlling interest in local plant-based business Before the Butcher.\n\nThe Netherlands-based business, which is centred on meat and ready meals, has a presence in alt-meats.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched meat-free brand The Blue Butcher, which sells into retail and foodservice.\n\nTwo years later,Van Loonset upThe No Meat Today Company, a dedicated meat-free arm, to try to expand its business in the meat-alternatives sector.\n\nIn August 2021, the US jerky firmCountry Archer Provisions launched a plant-based option, made from oyster mushrooms.\n\nThe jerky was rolled out in BBQ, teriyaki and spiced bacon variants.\n\nCountry Archer Provisions, based in San Bernardino, California, is best known for its grass-fed beef jerky and meat sticks. The company suggested its plant-based line is a “clean-label snack that both flexitarians and vegetarians will love”.\n\nAustralian beef and seafood processorHarvest Roadis a shareholder inProform Foods, a local plant-based meat business.\n\nHarvest Roadacquired its minority stake in Proform Foods in 2021.\n\nBased in Sydney, Proform Foods was set up in 2008 as an R&D business, providing protein ingredients. The company is still an ingredients supplier but has branched out into brands, selling the Meet range (stylised as ‘MEET’) of plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nStaying in Australia, another major local meat group that offers meat-alternatives isBaiada, the poultry processor.\n\nThe company markets a range of products, including nuggets, kievs and tenders, under the Greens & Goodness brand.\n\nBaiada says it uses a pea-based protein for its meat alternatives for “an improved taste, flavour, texture and nutrition”.\n\nThe Greens & Goodness range comprises frozen and chilled products. Upon the launch of the frozen SKUs in July 2022, Baiada said: “According to the research of 2,000 Australian consumers conducted by Baiada, one-in-four households now include at least one vegetarian, vegan or meat reducer, representing nearly AUD26bn in household consumer spending.\n\n“While existing plant-based protein offerings focus on wellness, research suggests that consumers are looking for greater convenience and improved taste and texture from current plant-based offerings.”\n\nIn April 2021, Orkla, the Nordic food manufacturer, announced the launch of anew dedicated alt-protein division.\n\nAnd in November that year, it revealed it wasexpanding a factory in Swedenthat produces plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nThe company saaid it was spending SEK70m ($81.2m at the time) on its facility in the southern town of Eslöv to up its capacity to make foods sold under the Anamma, Frankful and Naturlí brands.\n\nAs well as serving the Swedish market, the Eslöv site exports to other Nordic countries and the Baltic states.\n\n“We have had an incomparable development since 2015 when we started the vegan factory in Eslöv. The production volume is about seven times higher than five years ago,” Erik Wendel, the manager of the Eslöv factory, said.\n\nBut soon afterwards, it dialled back its plant-based M&A strategy, suggesting it will need to fast-track innovation to deliver on its category pledge.\n\nIn November 2024, Thai meat major Betagrobacked cultivated-meat company Meatable.\n\nThe investment, which comes from Betagro’s corporate venture capital arm Betagro Ventures, was heralded by Netherlands-based Meatable as a “landmark achievement”, being the first meat company in Asia to invest in the business, which creates cuts of meat in a lab from animal cells.\n\nMeatable suggested the deal reinforces its “mission to reshape the future of protein production as global demand for meat continues to rise”.\n\nThe Dutch company claims to have developed “groundbreaking cell-based technology, which is capable of producing high-quality pork and beef that mirror the taste, texture, and nutritional profile of conventionally produced meat”.\n\nIt uses Opti-ox, a patented proprietary stem cell technology, to develop the animal cells in a lab.\n\nMeatable said the collaboration with Betagro will accelerate its growth and market entry into Asia and opens the door to potential co-development projects.\n\n\"Eyeing alternatives – meat companies with stakes in meat-free and cell-based meat\" was originally created and published byJust Food, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

    "News_title":"Even Joe Rogan is blasting Trump’s ICE raids: ‘It’s insane’",
    "News_text":"The Trump administration’s nationwide immigration dragnet is “insane,” according to podcaster Joe Rogan, whoendorsed the Republicanduring the 2024 election.\n\n“We were told there would be no — well, there’s two things that are insane,” Rogansaidduring an episode of theJoe Rogan Experiencereleased Wednesday featuring Replit CEO Amjad Masad. “One is the targeting of migrant workers. Not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers. Just construction workers. Showing up in construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?”\n\nRogan has criticized the raids before,calling them “f***ing nuts” during a June show.\n\nThe Trump administration has used aggressive immigration raids against convicted criminals and migrants without criminal histories alike as part of its push todetain 3,000 undocumented people a dayand rapidly deport millions.\n\nRaids have taken place in homes, businesses, and residential areas across the country, ranging from restaurants andfarm fields,to Home Depot parking lots around Los Angeles anda Louisiana race track.\n\nAsThe Independenthas arrested, these operations, targeting individuals who would’ve been low priorities for removal under past administration, haveturned thriving immigrant neighborhoods into ghost towns.\n\nAmong those arrested and deported, 61 percent had no previous criminal conviction,according to aWashington Postanalysis.\n\nThe operations, often conducted mymasked, heavily armed federal agents, have been met with increasingly fervent protests, includingover a week of protest in Los Angeles last monththat saw scores of arrests and the White House deploying the National Guard and Marines over the objection of local officials.\n\nDemocratic leaders have also made a point of conductingoversight visits at the ICE detention centersnow holding more than 56,000 people, alikely record level.\n\nA May shoving match between Democratic lawmakers, ICE agents, and protesters outside a New Jersey detention facility — in which lawmakers accuse agents of roughing up members of Congress and federal officials say the lawmakers broke protocols — resulted infederal charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver, and since-dropped charges against the mayor of Newark.\n\nDespite the focus on rapid arrests, the Trump administration hasbrought few apparent penalties against businesses employing undocumented immigrants, despite promising to use unprecedented enforcement actions against employers to break up the economic incentives for illegal immigration.\n\nAWashington Postanalysis found that just one business has faced charges from among the roughly two dozen the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has announced raiding.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has vowed there will be no “safe spaces” for employers illegally hiring undocumented people.\n\n“You’re going to see more work site enforcement than you’ve ever seen in the history of this nation,” White House border czar Tom Homansaidlast month. “We’re going to flood the zone.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump, whose own businesses have been accused of illegally using migrant labor, has toyed with finding some sort of immigration compromise for businesses in hospitality and agriculture, which rely heavily on immigrant labor. But his immigration officials have insisted workplace raids will continue everywhere.\n\n“We’re working on it right now. We’re going to work it so that some kind of a temporary pass where people pay taxes, where the farmer can have a little control, as opposed to you walk in and take everybody away,” Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News’Sunday Morning Futures.\n\nThe Trump administration’sBig, Beautiful Bill spending packagewould further ramp up the pace of immigration raids.\n\nThe Senate version of the bill includes an additional $175 billion in immigration funding, including nearly $30 billion for enforcement and deportation operations, an unprecedented increase in funds that would make ICE the largest federal law enforcement agency and better funded than many global militaries.",

    "Date":"2025-07-03 19:15:00",
    "News_title":"Opinion - Online age-verification laws are reasonable, effective and long overdue",
    "News_text":"In recent weeks,headlineshave claimed Americans are being “dangerously misled” about age verification laws for online pornography. But what’s truly misleading is the suggestion that these laws are a threat to free speech or doomed to fail. In truth, they are a long-overdue update to bring online adult content in line with offline protections for minors.\n\nLaws such asTexas’s age verification law, which the Supreme Courtdetermined last week to be constitutional, simply require websites with a substantial amount of pornographic content to verify that users are adults before granting them access. Eighteen other states have passed similar laws and more are considering them.\n\nThis isn’t radical or unprecedented. We already ask for ID to buy alcohol, enter a casino or watch an R-rated film in a theater. Why would watching sex online be treated differently from watching it in person?\n\nCritics argue that these laws are ineffective because tech-savvy teenagers will find workarounds using VPNs. But no state law creates an exemption that says children can access porn if they just disguise their locations. The legal obligation remains on the website to prevent access when it cannot confirm that a user is outside of a state that requires age verification. Just as online gambling platforms restrict access based on state laws, porn sites can and should use the same geolocation tools.\n\nOthers suggest that age verification poses an unacceptable risk to user privacy. That may have been a legitimate concern in the past, but the technology has evolved. Today’s methods — whether scanning a government ID, using facial age estimation or checking reusable credentials — can be performed entirely on the user’s device, with no need to transmit or store any personal information. Even if private data is used, it is not kept. As many cybersecurity experts will tell you, the only truly un-hackable database is no database at all.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that age verification need not be a repeated task. Interoperable, reusable systems already exist (e.g.AgeAware). In many cases, a user can complete a check once and then reuse the result across multiple websites. And these checks take just seconds — comparable to unlocking a phone with Face ID or scanning a boarding pass. Framing this as an “undue burden” is out of step with how people already interact with technology every day.\n\nSome critics point to education as a better solution. But this is not an either-or choice. Of course we should educate teens about healthy relationships, consent and digital safety. But education alone isn’t enough. No public health strategy relies solely on education. We combine it with reasonable safeguards — seat belts, warning labels, firewalls, vaccinations.\n\nPorn literacy might help a teenager interpret what they’re seeing, but it doesn’t stop a 10-year-old from stumbling into violent or degrading content before he or she is ready to process it. Admittedly, the goal of age verification is not perfection. It is to stop most children from seeing most pornography most of the time. That is a reasonable benchmark. And it works, especially when combined with enforcement.\n\nParents also have a role to play. Age verification is one layer of protection but not the only one. Families should still take advantage of parental controls provided by internet service providers, home routers, device operating systems and app stores. But these tools have limits and many parents either don’t know how to use them or find them difficult to set up. That’s why we need a consistent enforceable standard at the website level where the content originates.\n\nThere is strong bipartisan support for these measures. A national poll by RMG Research found that83 percent of Americanssupport a federal requirement for age verification on pornographic websites. That’s not culture war politics. That’s a mainstream consensus that children deserve basic protections online. Age verification laws aren’t about banning speech. They’re about updating our digital infrastructure to reflect values we already hold — that some content is for adults only and that children should be protected from harm, especially when it’s preventable.\n\nDone well, age verification laws can protect children, preserve privacy and uphold adult freedoms. The real threat is not age verification — the real threat is pretending that the status quo is good enough.\n\nIain Corby is executive director of the Age Verification Providers Association, the global trade body representing providers of privacy-preserving age assurance technologies. He is regularly called as an expert witness to advise legislators around the world on how the latest online age checks operate.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_title":"Labour have just blown Britain’s last chance to fix the NHS",
    "News_text":"This was Labour’s big shot. It’s unlikely another government will be gifted this golden chance to gut and rebuild Britain’s broken health system. But judging by the contents ofWes Streeting’s 10-year plan, Labour has lost its nerve.\n\nThe Government’s goal of shifting away from treating very ill and frail people in hospital to preventing their illness in the first place is a sound one. Streeting’s plans do include some interesting policy ideas, particularly around technology and neighbourhood health.\n\nBut too many concerns go ignored for these plans to be considered a serious blueprint for change. Not least the fundamental problem that the NHS is a nationalised service funded through general taxation, with no price mechanism. We continue to refuse to learn from the experience of other countries, from France and Germany to Switzerland and Singapore, which all operate mixed economy healthcare systems.\n\nThere is a real risk now that NHS reform may become Labour’s Brexit, a great opportunity with massive upside that ends up being squandered through timidity and incompetence, with a political fallout which could be just as fierce.\n\nThis is a moment of both unprecedented crisis and opportunity. Demand for healthcare in our ageing nation,with increasing numbers on sickness benefits, is set to explode by 40 per cent in the next 10 years.\n\nThe political climate for reform has never been more favourable, and Labour, as the “party of the NHS” is given latitude by the public when it comes to the health service. It also has 403 seats. The public no longer regards the NHS as a sacred cow: according to one poll just one in five are satisfied with the way it is run.\n\nIt is in the interests of the political Right to back a genuine bid by Labour to transform it. Streeting should becommended for an energetic attempt to lay out a new visionthat threatens to ruffle feathers and challenge vested interests.\n\nThe PM’s press launch yesterday should have been a historic moment. But it was overshadowed by the fallout from Rachel Reeves’s tears in the chamber on Wednesday, which Keir Starmer yesterday appeared to try and laugh off. This is not a Government the public believes is serious about change, but rather one descending into chaos.\n\nMany of Streeting’s policy proposals are welcome. Yet the plans are packed with oddities – such as a “patient power payments” trial whereby the public will be given a say on whether their healthcare provider should be paid in full for specific treatments. As one senior Tory quipped to me: “It’s like the TV show where people pay the amount they feel the hotel stay was worth”.\n\nDoctors rightly fear that such provisions could lead to greater waste, with medics incentivised to offer unnecessary operations and drugs. Even more worrying is that the plan does not even engage with the social care timebomb. Nor does it offer any meaningful solutions to the NHS’s manpower crunch, even though its labour shortfall is set to quadruple in the next decade.\n\nArguably the biggest disappointment is that Labour’s 10-year plan fails to confront the reality that, at a time when Britain is cash-strapped, shifting the healthcare model from late treatment towards prevention would require that we defund the hospitals which currently consume 70 per cent of the health budget.\n\nPut simply, the country needs to stop chucking money at bringing down waiting lists.\n\nInstead it needs to bet the farm on preventative healthcare, putting money into everything from lung trucks and genomic sequencing to diet management courses for those at risk of diabetes. The UK could learn from Finland, which legislated in the 1970s to move funds from hospitals into community health.\n\nOr from the prairies of the remote American Midwest, which have boosted the prestige and quality of neighbourhood health by setting up medical schools that only produce GPs. But the Health Secretary, perhaps wary after Liz Kendall’sdisastrous attempts to reform welfare, seems reluctant to genuinely shake things up.\n\nAs the former North-West Regional Director for Public Health, John Ashton, told me: “An infatuation with hospitals has dominated the British psyche since 1948, when we dismantled a public health system that had prevention elements. Since then, the lion’s share of funding has been sucked into hospitals. And we have had this collusion between politicians and the medical profession, which is dominated by hospital medicine and hospital consultants.”\n\nThose who back Labour’s vision are worried about its ability to see things through. If Streeting’s weaker policy ideas border on the bizarre, his stronger ones, such as enhancing the NHS app, seem incomplete.\n\nJust as banking apps only became powerful when they could do more than display customers’ balances and were wired into underlying financial transaction systems, ahealthcare appwill only be of use if it can be connected to appointments and referrals networks.\n\nIt is not clear that Labour fully understands this, or is willing to put up the investment. They risk presiding over Britain’s biggest computer flop since the New Labour NHS IT upgrade fiasco.\n\nYet the most immediate problem with Labour’s plans is that they are simply financially implausible. This week, amid the Prime Minister’s Personal Independence Payment climbdown, a benefits cuts package that was supposed to bring in £5 billion of savings will probably end up costing the taxpayer tens of millions. Britain does not have the money to bankroll a NHS reform package which refuses to accept the need for trade-offs, or to end its most wasteful elements.\n\nWe saw with the Tories how the failure to rise to the historic occasion of Brexit can condemn an almost hegemonic party to irrelevance.\n\nIf the Labour Government, mired in division and bogged in ensuring its day-to-day survival, has just allowed an unparalleled opportunity to slip through the country’s fingers, then that is a national tragedy for which Labour may never be forgiven.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The toxic byproducts of cyanobacterial blooms — also known as blue-green algae — cyanotoxins occur most often in freshwaters.\n\nThere are relatively few documented cases of severe human health effects, butexposure to cyanotoxins and cyanobacteriacan result in rashes, eye irritation, respiratory symptoms, inflammation of the stomach and intestines, liver and kidney failure, or even death.\n\nSome recent research has found living near bodies of water frequently impacted by the blooms and cyanobacteria toxins may put residentsat an increased risk of dying from ALS, the debilitating neurodegenerative disease.\n\n“The most likely pathway to exposure for humans is through accidental ingestion or inhalation during recreational activities in lakes, rivers and bays,”the Environmental Protection Agency explained.\n\nThe most common cyanotoxin, microcystin, is a potent liver toxin and possible human carcinogen. People should contact their doctors if they start to exhibit nausea, vomiting, digestive distress, breathing problems, seizure, or unexplained illness.\n\nCyanotoxins can also kill any pets or livestock that drink the affected waters.\n\nAlthough recreation on Lake Powell remains open, park officials have told swimmers to stay out of water with an algal bloom and not to boat on scummy water.\n\n“These activities can cause toxins to become airborne, increasing the likelihood you will inhale them,” the Park Service wrote.\n\nThey noted other areas of the lake may also contain the toxins.\n\nHarmful algal bloomsalso affected the recreation area last fall, and are increasingly occurring due to the impacts of climate change and hotter temperatures.\n\nIn Michigan, the blooms have long plagued Lake Erie.

    "News_title":"The One Big Beautiful Bill Now Heads to President Trump",
    "News_text":"From the Paragon Institute's Brian Blase:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has passed the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), sending it to President Trump for his signature on July 4. OBBB is a sweeping package of tax cuts, program reforms, and spending measures. Its health policy provisions largely reverse the reckless and inflationary Biden administration policies that led to massive improper enrollment in Medicaid and the Obamacare exchanges—and unleashed unprecedented levels of waste, fraud, abuse, and corporate welfare. Notably, enacting the OBBB reforms required Congress to overcome fierce opposition from powerful health care special interest groups that profit from the status quo and lobby aggressively to preserve the flow of government subsidies into their coffers.Federal health programs are on an unsustainable trajectory andare the primary driver of the nation’s worsening fiscal outlook. The Biden administration pursued an enrollment-at-any-cost agenda with dramatically higher federal subsidies to health insurers and big hospital systems. As a result, the federal baseline for Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies increased by$1.9 trillion over the next decadebased on a comparison between the 2021 and 2025 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates.The figure below shows the combined growth of the Medicaid and Obamacare subsidy baselines between the beginning and end of the Biden administration. It also shows the effect of OBBB on these two programs as estimated by CBO, including the rural transformation program added by the U.S. Senate. The key takeaway: OBBB is not cutting these programs but rather brings spending projections back in line with pre-Biden projections.\n\nThe main sources of savings include: 1) addressing the Medicaid money-laundering machine; 2) implementing community-engagement requirements in Medicaid for able-bodied, working-age Obamacare Medicaid expansion enrollees; 3) verifying enrollee eligibility and limiting Obamacare subsidies to U.S. citizens; and 4) rescinding costly Biden administration rules.\n\nTheMedicaid money-laundering machine—higher provider tax ‘scam’ revenue fueling Medicaid payment rates well above Medicare rates—exploded during the Biden administration. There has been longstanding bipartisan concern about these schemes withPresident Obama introducing reforms to phase down the provider tax safe harbor from 6.0 percent to 3.5 percentin his 2013 budget proposal. The safe harbor is effectively the amount that states can tax providers and leverage that revenue to obtain federal matching funds, which are then used to make extremely large payments to the providers taxed. In many instances, states keep some of the extra federal funding to use on programs unrelated to Medicaid.The OBBB incorporates the Obama proposal in Medicaid expansion states, phasing down the current 6.0 percent safe harbor to 3.5 percent, starting in 2028 with a 0.5 percentage point decrease each year. The bill also freezes provider taxes in all states, so that states can’t increase this funding “scam.”The OBBB also implements stricter rules on provider taxes to curb particularly egregious state financing abuses, such asCalifornia’s use of a managed care tax that disproportionately targeted Medicaid providers to draw down excessive federal funds—and then expand Medicaid to unauthorized immigrants the following year. The reform reinforces requirements that taxes be broad-based and uniform to prevent the explicit kickback mechanism of these taxes, where the entities that disproportionately bear the burden of the tax are the ones that receive the benefit of higher Medicaid payments.The OBBB ensures that Medicaid payment rates, through health insurers, cannot exceed Medicare rates. The legislation would limit state proposals not submitted by the date of enactment to Medicare rates (110 percent of Medicare rates in non-Medicaid expansion states), and it would gradually phase down existing payments that are above Medicare rates until they come into compliance. There is a similar Medicaid payment cap on fee-for-service payments in the program.\n\nThe OBBB prioritizes work over welfare for able-bodied, working-age adults—helping to preserve resources for the most vulnerable and promoting work, education, and community service. The provision would require states to implement community-engagement requirements for able-bodied working-age Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents aged 14 and younger. Individuals could meet the requirements through 80 hours a month of work, education, community service, or job training.The provision includes reasonable exemptions from the requirements. It also exempts pregnant women, children, seniors, medically frail individuals, caregivers, tribal members, and those already meeting work requirements under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nThe Biden administration was focused on maximizing enrollment in the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, regardless of whether enrollees were eligible. We estimate that states have incorrectly classifiedat least 5 million people as Medicaid expansion enrollees—costing federal taxpayers about $30 billion this year. We estimate that there areat least 6.4 million individuals in fully-subsidized exchange plans who do not meet eligibility criteria—costing nearly another $30 billion this year. Improper exchange enrollment was driven by expanded subsidies and Biden-era policies that enrolled and re-enrolled individuals without verifying income or other pertinent information. Paragon has anew policy briefdetailing how the OBBB will reduce improper exchange enrollment, including its provisions prohibiting automatic re-enrollment and requiring that excessive advanced subsidies be repaid.The OBBB would require states to check Medicaid expansion enrollees’ eligibility twice a year, up from once a year, and would reduceduplicate payments to address the same person covered under Medicaid managed care plans in multiple states. On the exchanges, it would require income verification prior to enrollment, would close a special enrollment period that has been a de facto way for people to enroll throughout the year regardless of meeting eligibility requirements, and would end the perpetuation of improper subsidies by requiring enrollees to submit information once a year to maintain advance payment of the subsidies.The OBBB also limits Obamacare subsidies to only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. It closes loopholes that currently permit asylum seekers, parolees, and those with Temporary Protected Status to receive Obamacare subsidies if their income is below the federal poverty level (FPL), and it disallows Obamacare subsidies for people below 100 percent FPL who are in a five-year waiting period for lawfully present status.\n\nIn a break from typical administrations, the Biden administration promulgated several health care rules with large fiscal costs. The OBBB places a 10-year moratorium on several expensive Biden administration rules, including:\n\nA rule that exacerbates improper enrollment with weakened verification standards and a lack of coordination for dual enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid;\n\nA rule that made it more difficult for states to remove ineligible enrollees from Medicaid and perpetuated fraud and improper payments; and\n\nA rule that mandated a minimum number of nurses per resident in nursing homes, ignoring local workforce realities and threatening access to care, especially in rural communities.\n\nThe OBBB represents a major course correction for federal health policy, reversing the reckless and inflationary Medicaid and Obamacare spending surge under the Biden administration. Rather than cutting these programs, OBBB restores spending to pre-Biden projections by reducing waste, reducing fraud, and better targeting federal resources to the truly eligible and most vulnerable. Through reforms like cracking down on Medicaid money laundering, promoting work and personal responsibility, reducing improper enrollment and subsidies, focusing programs on those eligible and most in need, and reversing costly regulations, OBBB achieves an estimated $1.2 trillion in savings.\n\nThe savings shown are fromCBO's estimatesof the legislation and do not include interactions among provisions. Sections 71115, 71116, and 71117 are included in Addressing the Medicaid Money-Laundering Machine, Section 71119 is included in the Implementing Community-Engagement Requirements in Medicaid, Sections 71103, 71107, 71301, 71302, 71303, and 71304 are included in the Ensuring Medicaid Expansion and Obamacare Enrollees Are Eligible and Limiting Obamacare Subsidies to Citizens, and Sections 71101, 71102, and 71111 are included in the Rescinding Costly Biden Administration Rules.",

    "News_text":"COLUMBUS, N.M. (AP) — The military is expanding its authority and reach along swaths of the southern U.S. border where troops have been empowered to detain people who enter the country illegally.\n\nDesignated militarized zoneswill soon cover nearly one-third of the U.S. border with Mexico under supervision of nearby military bases. Federal prosecutors have filedcriminal trespassing charges in the militarized terrainagainst more than 1,400 people, adding to possible consequences for people who cross the border illegally.\n\nReaction to the military buffer has been mixed among residents of New Mexico’s rural Luna County, where a strong culture of individual liberty is tempered by the desire to tame networks that ferry migrants and contraband across the border.\n\nSome farmers and ranchers have welcomed the military's expanded mission. But the changes also are being challenged in court and questioned by civil rights advocates and outdoor enthusiasts including hunters and hikers who fear they'll be locked out of public lands.\n\nNo-entry signs\n\nThe first two militarized zones, introduced in April and May, extend along 230 miles (370 kilometers) of border. The buffer runs from Fort Hancock, Texas, through El Paso and westward past factories and cattle yards to partially encircle the New Mexico border village of Columbus, where in 1916 Mexican revolutionary forces led by Pancho Villa crossed into the U.S. in a deadly predawn raid.\n\nThe Army has posted thousands of no-entry signs across the region, declaring a “restricted area by authority of the commander.”\n\nJames Johnson, a fourth-generation local farmer, oversees the summer harvests on private farmland along 5 miles (8 kilometers) of the border.\n\nHe says the military deployments under prior presidents put “eyes and ears” on the border and that the new approach is “trying to give some teeth” to enforcement.\n\nLuna County Commissioner Ray Trejo says he and other hunters are worried about their rights to carry firearms and harvest game from the newly designated militarized zones. He sees the new trespassing charges as inhumane in an economy built on immigrant farm labor.\n\n“People are coming into our country to work, stepping now all of a sudden into a military zone, and they have no idea,” he said.\n\nAbbey Carpenter leads a search-and-rescue group for missing migrants and says public access is being denied acrosssweltering stretches of desert where migrant deaths have surged.\n\n“Maybe there are more deaths, but we don’t know,” she said.\n\nFewer border crossings\n\nBorder Patrol arrests along the southern border this year have dropped to the slowest pace since 1966, including a 30% drop in June.\n\nOn June 28, the Border Patrol made only 137 arrests, a stark contrast with late 2023 when arrests topped 10,000 on the busiest days.\n\nThwarted attempts to cross have plunged not only sinceTrumptook office but also previously when President Joe Biden introduced severe asylum restrictions in June 2024, and when Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders in December 2023.\n\nAt least 7,600 members of the armed forces have vastly expanded the U.S. government presence on the border.\n\nThe Defense Department last week addedan additional 250-mile (400-kilometer) militarized area in Texas’ Rio Grande Valleyand plans another near Yuma, Arizona. Combined, the four zones will cover nearly one-third of the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nLegal challenges\n\nThe new militarized zones aretied to President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergencyon the border on his first day in office this year.\n\nThe moves are being challenged in proceedings at a federal courthouse in Las Cruces on the banks of the Upper Rio Grande, with mixed outcomes.\n\nMigrants in drab county jail jumpsuits and chains filed before a magistrate judge on a recent weekday. They included a 29-year-old woman from Guatemala who sells pottery for a living. Military trespassing charges against her were dismissed for lack of evidence, but a conviction for illegal entry resulted in a two-week jail sentence before likely deportation.\n\nIn separate proceedings, a federal public defender's office has challenged the military’s new oversight of public land at the border in New Mexico — an area nearly twice the size of Washington, D.C., — seizing on the arrest of one Mexican man for trespassing through remote terrain to test the legal waters.\n\nIt says the designation of a militarized zone in New Mexico without congressional authorization is “a matter of staggering and unprecedented political significance.” A judge has yet to rule on the arguments.",

And this presents him with a unique opportunity for independence from the Trump machine in the 18 months he has left in office.\n\nThe bottom line: With both houses of Congress divided by razor-thin margins, Senator Tillis’s declaration of independence gives him the chance to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina in decades.

    "News_title":"How do CT Republicans feel about Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill? Here’s what they said",
    "News_text":"Connecticut Republicans are hailing certain aspects of President Donald Trump’s mammoth tax-and-spending bill, butDemocrats continue blastingthe deep spending cuts that will sharply impactthose receiving Medicaidand food stamps.\n\nIn Connecticut, lawmakers are still trying to determine the exact impacts of a 940-page bill that covers virtually all aspects of the federal government. Lawmakers here say they can dip into the state’s rainy day fund — now at $5 billion— to fill any funding gaps left by the actions of Trump and the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe multi-faceted bill includes a range of tax cuts and large spending increases for immigration enforcement to carry out Trump’s plans to round up undocumented immigrants across the country. At the same time, the measure includes deep cuts for those who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance and food stamps to help feed their needy families.\n\nHouse Republican leader Vincent Candelora of North Branford said the bill is large enough to generate both plaudits and complaints as lawmakers struggled for long days in Washington, D.C. before the final vote Thursday that sealed the deal before the July 4 holiday weekend.\n\n“I think, generally speaking, that neither side of the aisle at the federal level is free from criticism,” Candelora told The Courant in an interview. “We have had a process that has been broken for decades.”\n\nOn the tax side, one of the biggest victories for tax-cutting Republicans is raising the $10,000 cap per couple on federal deductions for state and local taxes, which is known as the SALT tax. First enacted in 2017 under Trump, the law has said that homeowners with high property taxes, for example, could only deduct the first $10,000 on their federal taxes. That has become a key issue through the years in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and beyond.\n\n“For New England, it’s impactful,” Candelora said. “A $10,000 cap doesn’t cut it any more. … We certainly have an issue in states like ours that have massively high property taxes.”\n\nIn the updated, final version of the bill, the U.S. Senate switched its position and pushed the cap to $40,000 per year for five years in a number that would increase by 1% each year. The increased provision would cover those with incomes up to $500,000 per year before the deduction would start to phase out.\n\nSenate Republican leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield agreed with Candelora, saying that the SALT deduction impacts homeowners statewide.\n\n“That obviously helps a lot of our constituents,” Harding told The Courant. “We can certainly squabble over other aspects of the bill. Regardless of the other aspects, in terms of the SALT deduction, that is beneficial to the people of the state of Connecticut, which generally has higher state and local taxes and are able to deduct more and potentially get a reduced tax bill.”\n\nAfter the SALT deduction was capped in 2017, then-Connecticut tax commissioner Kevin B. Sullivan and others crafted a workaround by creating the pass-through entity tax in the state for the first time. Since then, the taxes paid by pass-through entities have exploded to $2.2 billion in the current fiscal year that ends June 30, which Sullivan says is far beyond anyone’s expectations at the time that the tax was created.\n\nIn a key point, federal lawmakers successfully pushed for a provision that would allow pass-through entities to continue deducting state and local taxes.\n\nWhile many Connecticut taxpayers no longer itemize their federal deductions after the 2017 tax changes, the wealthiest tax filers also have the highest SALT deductions. Among those earning more than $1 million per year, the deductions were among the highest in the nation in 2015, at nearly $330,000, according to the legislature’s nonpartisan research office.\n\nTaxpayers earning between $75,000 and $100,000 per year would pay additional taxes, on average, of only $19 per year, the research office said. Those earning more than $1 million per year would pay an additional $118,000 per year, boosting the overall average.\n\nConnecticut was traditionally tied with New Jersey for the second-highest percentage of taxpayers claiming the SALT deduction — at 41% of federal tax returns before the tax changes.\n\nThe state and local tax deduction limit for married taxpayers who file separately is $5,000, compared with $10,000 for couples, under the current law.\n\nThe final bill includes the politically popular idea of no tax on tips, although relatively few workers actually receive tips in their jobs. But restaurant servers, food delivery drivers, barbers, and bartenders, among others, often rely heavily on tips for their compensation.\n\nDemocrats have blasted Trump and Republicans for providing large tax cuts for the wealthiest residents.\n\nCandelora, though, says that the wealthiest pay the largest amount of taxes at both the state and federal levels. Between the income tax and the pass-through entity tax, the wealthy have paid billions of dollars through the years that have led to the recent surpluses under Gov. Ned Lamont and enabled the state to pay down billions in pension debt.\n\nStatistics from Lamont’s budget office show that in 2022 the top 2.5% of tax filers paid 41% of the state income tax. At the other end, the bottom 49% of filers — representing essentially half of filers statewide — paid only 2.9% of the income tax.\n\nLess than 3% of the income taxes is paid by 830,000 filers who are earning less than $50,000 per year in adjusted gross income — for both singles and couples filing jointly. Filers earning more than $100,000 per year pay 85% of the income tax, while those under $100,000, representing 72% of filers, pay 15%, according to the statistics.\n\nThe top 1%, which includes filers at $1 million and above, pays about 30% of the income taxes. In addition, the state is projected to collect $2 billion this year from the pass-through entity tax, which is largely paid by entities controlled by wealthy small business owners.\n\nBut deputy House Speaker pro tempore Bob Godfrey of Danbury harshly criticized Trump’s tax policies in the bill.\n\n“Billionaires, big corporations, big businesses getting tax cuts funded by cuts to working-class families, poor people, children, and sick people is disgusting,” Godfrey told The Courant in an interview. “I remember Trump’s big tax bill in his first term that was supposed to be so helpful for everyone. All I knew is that before that, I was getting $2,000 a year back from the IRS in my tax return, and then afterwards, I had to pay $2,000 a year. It was a $4,000-a-year switch for me. I wasn’t happy about it.”\n\nOne of the most controversial provisions of the sweeping bill is the cuts in Medicaid, the nationwide health insurance program.\n\n“Medicaid is overextended,” Candelora said, noting that Medicaid was expanded during President Barack Obama’s tenure and now includes more patients than in the past.\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly said that the state could save $116 million over two years by ending Medicaid coverage for illegal immigrants. But state social services commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said the cost is actually $40 million per year.\n\n“Whether it’s $40 million or $100 million, should the state of Connecticut or any state be providing health insurance to illegal immigrants?” Candelora asked. “The state of Connecticut is providing a Cadillac plan to illegal immigrants. Our federal government can’t keep giving everything away.”\n\nWhile national Republicans have repeatedly stated that Medicaid is rife with fraud, Harding said he was not sure about the levels of illegality.\n\n“Do I think there is fraud in Medicaid at times? Unfortunately, yes,” Harding said. “Do I believe it’s widespread? I have no evidence to say that. Do I believe that there potentially is fraud, albeit maybe hopefully isolated? Yes. … I don’t have evidence that shows that it’s widespread as maybe some people have tried to say.”\n\nConcerning food stamp cuts, Harding said, “I don’t want to see any benefits cut from anyone that rightly deserves it and needs the funds to help feed themselves and their family. … I’d like to think that legislators on all sides of the aisle are compassionate.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, blasted Trump’s bill.\n\n“Republicans just raised the cost of living for working Americans,” DeLauro said after the final vote. “President Trump promised to lower the cost of living from day one. Instead, he and Republicans in Congress cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy while sticking working and middle-class families with the bill. President Trump’s budget bill hands $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations while gutting the very programs that help everyday Americans survive. This bill will make peoples’ daily lives more expensive for years to come.”\n\nDeLauro added, “This bill slashes Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage, ripping critical, affordable healthcare away from nearly 17 million Americans, including 186,580 people in Connecticut that rely on HUSKY or Access Health CT. It would trigger a further $500 billion cut to Medicare. It guts clean energy investments, raising electricity bills across the country. And it cuts $200 billion from proven food assistance programs like SNAP while grocery bills keep rising, taking food away from 42 million Americans.”\n\nLike DeLauro, U.S. Rep. John B. Larson of East Hartford voted against the package.\n\n“It has always been President Trump’s number one priority to make his tax cuts for the wealthy permanent, and that is exactly what this bill does,” Larson said. “What he does not mention is that it pays for those tax breaks by kicking 17 million Americans off their health care and raising premiums for others, slashing food assistance and student aid, and exploding the national debt. This bill is unprecedented in both how big of a tax cut billionaires like him and Elon Musk will receive, and also how it will hurt children, the elderly, the disabled, and our nation’s veterans.”\n\nChristopher Keating can be reached atckeating@courant.com",

    "News_title":"UN experts say Rwanda supported rebels in Congo and smuggled minerals at ‘unprecedented levels’",
    "News_text":"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Rwanda provided “critical” support to the M23 rebels' recent offensive in eastern Congo, which helped secure Kigali's access to minerals and fertile ground, according to a confidential United Nations report seen by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group is the most prominent armed group in the conflict inEastern Congo, which has been in and out of crises for decades. The rebels earlier this year advanced andseized the strategic city of Gomaand Bukavu in a major escalation of the conflict.\n\nRwanda has denied any involvement. But U.N. experts say Kigali provided backing to the rebels with an aim to “control the territory of the DRC and its natural resources,\" using “advanced military equipment, including jamming systems, short-range air defense system and armed drones.”\n\nRwanda has been accused of exploiting eastern Congo’s minerals, used in smartphones, advanced fighter jets and much more, which Kigali denies. The report said that smuggling of coltan, considered a critical mineral, from M23-controlled territories in recent months reached “unprecedented levels.\"\n\n“Evidence indicated increasing risk of cross-border fraud as minerals from North Kivu, particularly coltan from the AFC-controlled Rubaya mine, continued to be smuggled to Rwanda.” the report said. “These minerals were then mixed with production of Rwandan origin and exported downstream.”\n\nAFC, or Congo River Alliance, is an umbrella groups which includes M23.\n\nThe M23-controlled Rubaya mines produce coltan — short for columbite-tantalite — an ore from which the metals tantalum and niobium are extracted. Both are considered critical raw materials by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan.\n\nTantalum is used in mobile phones, computers and automotive electronics, as well as in aircraft engines, missile components and GPS systems. Niobium is used in pipelines, rockets and jet engines.\n\nCongo produced about 40% of the world’s coltan in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, with Australia, Canada and Brazil being other major suppliers.\n\nPart of the minerals smuggled to Rwanda were purchased by Boss Mining Solution Limited, a Rwandan company. To justify the plausibility of domestic origins of tantalum, tin and tungsten, the Rwandan Development Board declared annual domestic production of 8,000 to 9,000 tons of these minerals, the report said. The figure was contradicted by the National Institute of Statistics, independent geological studies and ITSCI.\n\nLate last month, Rwanda and Congo signeda peace dealfacilitated by the U.S. while helping the U.S. government and American companies gain access to critical minerals in the region. But experts said they don’t believe it will quickly end the fighting because the most prominent armed group says it does not apply to it.\n\nRwanda denied the allegations from the U.N. report.\n\nAlluding to the U.N. report, Rwanda's president Paul Kagame told reporters on Friday:“The expertise they provide, the reports they write actually do not have anything to do with the situation itself. These reports were written long ago — long ago when they were given the mission.”\n\nA spokesperson for Rwanda’s government, Yolande Makolo, wrote on X that “⁠Following the signing of the US-brokered Peace Agreement last Friday, Rwanda is fully committed to its implementation.”\n\nThe report, which was first reported by Reuters, was submitted to the U.N. Security Council sanctions committee for Congo earlier this week, and will be published shortly, said a U.N. official who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly.\n\nDespite Congo's exceptional mineral wealth, over 70% of Congolese live on less than $2.15 a day. The conflict in the country's east has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises with more than 7 million people displaced, including100,000 who fled homes this year.\n\nThe U.N. report also accused all sides in the conflict of human rights violations, including reprisal killings on suspicion of collaboration of the opposing sides.\n\nRwanda and M23 are responsible for “systematic campaign of repression in occupied areas, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest, torture, enforced disappearance and raids in hospitals,\" it said. Retreating Congolese soldiers and members of the pro-government militia “committed looting, sexual violence and killings.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Wilson McMakin in Dakar, Senegal and Rodney Muhumuza in Kampala, Uganda, contributed to this report.",

    "News_text":"Sir Keir Starmeris marking his first year inDowning Streetafter suffering the shortest honeymoon of any prime minister in history, despitewinning a massive411 seats and aworking majority of156.\n\nAfter 365 days of his premiership, Labour is lingering in the polls at 23 per cent, behind Nigel Farage’s insurgent Reform UK (28 per cent), and one of the defining images of this government so far may be chancellorRachel Reeves in tears in the Commons earlier this week.\n\nWhen Starmer took office he promised growth and benefits for “working people”, but hisnational insurance tax risehas left fewer jobs and an economy that is stagnating.\n\nHe has, though, pledged a 2.8 per cent increase to the NHS spending budget over a three-year period, amounting to a £30bn rise by 2028.\n\nSir Keir has been a success on the international stage, withthree trade dealsand apivotal role in the war in Ukraineand crises in the Middle East. He will have brought defence spending up to 2.5 per cent of GDP by April 2027 and aims to get to 3 per cent in the next parliament.\n\nThe prime minister hasbecome the “Trump whisperer”, winning over the erratic US president while rebuilding Britain’s international relationships and reputation around the globe.\n\nDespite the weakness of his position at home, withsome in Labour suggesting he could be oustedas early as May next year, he remains the last reasonable option for a leader with fiscal responsibility at the head of a party that wants to take the brakes off spending and raise taxes.\n\nBut he marked his first anniversary with asignificant rebellion, which saw him ditch welfare reforms that would have saved his government £5bn a year, largely on disability benefits.\n\nThough Labourwon 411 of 650 seats in last year’s general election, the party took home a more moderate 33.8 per cent of the national vote on a turnout of just 60 per cent, with some describing it as “the loveless landslide”.\n\nof its vote share since the election\n\nNow, one year later, polls from Techne show that just 23 per cent of voters would opt for Labour in a general election.\n\nYet the past year has seenReform UK make an unprecedented climbin the polls, at 28 per cent of the vote (according to Techne) – leaving the Tories reduced to 18 per cent.\n\nLabour still leads among younger voters, finding favour with 29 per cent of 18- to 34-year-olds. But older voters have turned to Farage and Reform, now the first-choice party for a third of voters aged 55 and over.\n\nAdded to this, confidence in the government is running at an all-time low of just 25 per cent, and Sir Keir’s personal net favourability hasfallen to a new low of -46, according to YouGov.\n\nPart of his rapid loss in popularity came when it emerged that Sir Keir, his wife Lady Victoria and anumber of senior cabinet ministers had received controversial free gifts. These included hospitality at Arsenal, worth £8,750 per game, for the PM towatch his favourite football team.\n\nclothes and accommodation donated to the PM by Lord Alli\n\nSir Keir received nearly £19,000 worth of work clothes and several pairs of glasses, as well as £20,000 worth of accommodation, from Waheed Alli, the former chair of online fashion retailer Asos.\n\nThe PM also received a £4,000 ticket from the Football Association to see Taylor Swift at Wembley Stadium. It also emerged that he had failed to declare a gift of clothes for his wife Victoria from Lord Alli.\n\nThe UK has negotiated two major trade deals, while a third has come in the form ofa “Brexit reset” with the EU.\n\nThe UK-India trade agreement was years in the making, but was finally signed in May this year. The deal represents a £25.5bn boost to trade, according to government estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, as Donald Trump unleashed tariffs across the world, the UK came out relatively unscathed – a feat that has largely been attributed to Sir Keir’s negotiations with his US counterpart.\n\nfrom negotiating a US tariff deal (estimated)\n\nBy bringing down automotive tariffs from 25 to 10 per cent, and eliminating levies on British cars, the US-UK trade deal is estimated to cut the blow from tariffs in half – from £10.8bn to £4.3bn, according to analysis revealed byThe Independent.

The number of people crossing the channel has increased significantly under Labour, by 34 per cent.\n\nThere have been around 42,000 small boat arrivals in the year ending 30 June 2025, compared to 31,000 in the previous year, and the figure is on course to exceed the peak of 45,000 in 2022.\n\nSir Keir has already facedeight resignations by ministers, most notably international development minister Anneliese Dodds, whoquit over brutal cuts to the UK’s aid budgetfrom 0.5 per cent of GDP to 0.3 per cent.\n\nTwo ministers resigned over cuts to disability benefits, while Treasury secretary Tulip Siddiq stepped back amid a corruption investigationinvolving her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, a former prime minister of Bangladesh.\n\nJust weeks after the election,Labour suspended seven MPswho voted against the whip for an amendment to scrap the two-child benefit cap, while a further 42 abstained.\n\nLabour MPs voted against the whip last July\n\nThree MPs – John McDonnell, Apsana Begum and Zarah Sultana – have still not been readmitted into the Labour fold nearly 12 months later. Ms Sultana has since announced she isstarting a new party with former Labour leaderJeremy Corbyn.\n\nThegovernment’s welfare bill, which passed just this week by 335 to 260 votes, faced major criticism for risking a restrictive system that could limit benefits for those who need them most. A total of 49 Labour rebels voted against it.\n\nIn 12 months, Sir Keir has reversed or significantly altered his stance on fivemajor political issues.\n\nIn addition to watering down this week’s welfare bill, Sir Keir announced thatwinter fuel payments will be extendedto a further 7.5 million pensioners, after raising the threshold for eligibility early in his government to help fill a black hole of £22bn Ms Reeves claimed to have found in the country’s finances.\n\nsignificant U-turns by Starmer\n\nBefore the election, Labour promised it would not increase national insurance payments, but thenincreased employer national insurance contributionsby 2 per cent.\n\nSir Keir also finally agreed to launch aninquiry into grooming gangs, after months of deeming it unnecessary and describing those calling for one as “far right”.\n\nHe also said that the “Waspi” women would not receive compensation for the increase in the state pension age, having promised before he was elected that a Labour government would compensate them.\n\nOverall, inflation has gradually increased over a year of Labour governance, landing at 3.4 per cent in May. This is up from 2.2 per cent in July 2024, the month of the general election, leading to concerns about interest rates.\n\nCritics have claimed that after the last Tory government brought inflation down to 2.2 per cent, Labour are now beginning to lose control of it again.\n\npublic sector debt\n\nThe UK’s national debt stands at £2.86 trillion, up by £130bn since the general election, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nOverall, debt makes up 96.4 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to the latest figures – up from 95.9 per cent last May. This is despite fiscal rules limiting debt imposed on the Treasury by Ms Reeves.\n\nThis climbing debt comes with a hefty interest bill, to the tune of £5.6bn a year.\n\nis spent on working-age benefits\n\nAnanalysis byThe Independentearlier this year found that the number of disability benefit recipients in the UK has risen more than other countries since Covid. However, the state spends less on welfare overall compared with other European countries.\n\nNonetheless, welfare spending made up nearly a third (28 per cent) of the Labour government’s first Budget, at £303bn, with the majority going towards state pensions and benefits for the elderly population.\n\nWorking-age benefits alone cost £117.6bn, around 4.2 per cent of GDP, which is more than defence and education spending.\n\nAt the same time, the UK is the only G7 nation that has seen economic inactivity increase since Covid. It currently stands at 21.3 per cent of working-age people.\n\nBut economic inactivity has gone down over the first year of Sir Keir’s Labour government, from 9.47 million people up to June last year, to 9.19 million people in the latest figures (April 2025).\n\nThe number of payrolled employees dropped by 115,000 in the last year following the 2 per cent national insurance increase.

    "News_text":"Lifeway Foods investors Edward and Ludmila Smolyansky are looking to replace the kefir maker's board in the latest salvo in the long-running row over how the US company is run.\n\nTogether, Edward, the brother of Lifeway’s CEO Julie Smolyansky, and their mother Ludmila, exercise voting control with respect to approximately 23.2% of the outstanding shares of the company.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday (2 July), the mother-and-son duo said they have submitted a “definitive consent statement” to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to replace Lifeway’s board, including CEO Julie, with new nominees “focused on restoring accountability, transparency and long-term shareholder value”.\n\nEdward and Ludmila’s proposal outlines four main steps: gaining shareholder approval to reverse bylaw changes made after 24 March 2023; removing the current board, including the CEO; electing seven new directors skilled in governance, finance, and consumer products; and updating bylaws to block the hiring of the president or CEO’s immediate family members.\n\nThe proposals for board removal and director election are interdependent, the duo said.\n\nJust Foodhas contacted Lifeway for comment.\n\nEdward said: “It is apparent to us that the current board has no intent to engage with us. We believe this consent solicitation is the most direct and effective way to return Lifeway to the people who actually own it.\n\n“The company's circumstances demand bold, unprecedented action. We must end entrenched, self-serving control and bring in leadership that will act in the best interests of all shareholders.\"\n\nEdward filed a preliminary consent statement on 2 June, seeking shareholder approval to elect himself, Ludmila, and five others as directors.\n\nHe previously held roles as CFO, COO, director, and controller at Lifeway, while Ludmila is co-founder and former chair.\n\nEdward went on to say tat the board has “repeatedly disregarded shareholder feedback, failed to articulate a credible strategy, and chosen to reward failure”.\n\nThe tussle between the Smolyanskys has beenongoing since 2022.\n\nIn July last year, Edward and Ludmilademanded the resignationsof Julie and most directors, citing underperformance and mismanagement, and filed a preliminary consent statement to unseat the board, including Julie, in August.\n\nIn September, Danone, owning over 23% of Lifeway, offered to acquire the remaining shares for $25 each, a 59% premium over the three-month average price.\n\nLifewayrejectedDanone’s offer on 5 November, deeming it undervalued.\n\nThe French dairy major, which has held a stake in Lifeway since 1999, increased its bid to $27 per share, supported by Edward and Ludmila, but the Lifewayboard turned that down too.\n\nIn late December, Danone prepared litigation alleging a breach of a 1999 shareholder agreement after Lifeway granted nearly 300,000 shares to Julie without its consent.\n\nLifewaycontended in Januarythe agreement was void under Illinois state law and in March Danone’s lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.\n\nIn March this year, Lifeway announced a counterclaim against Danone, accusing it of a “hostile takeover” at an undervalued price and alleging “predatory actions”.\n\nLater that month, Edward haslaunched an official campaignto replace the company’s board of directors.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, the company reported net sales of $46.1m, up 3.3% from the same period in 2024. The company’s net income was $3.5m, up 45.8% year on year.

    "News_text":"UPS plans to offer voluntary buyouts to unionized delivery drivers for the first time in its history as it looks to align the workforce with the downsizing of its domestic ground network and Amazon business.\n\nThe news follows management’s disclosure in April of intentions to eliminate 20,000 front-line positions as part of a broader effort to cut excess capacity and improve profits. UPS’s (NYSE: UPS) network optimization plan, called Network of the Future, envisions closing 200 sortation centers over five years and increasing automation for handling packages. Dozens of facilities have already been consolidated in the past year.\n\nPackage drivers would “receive a generous financial package if they choose to leave UPS” on top of earned retirement benefits, including pension and healthcare, the parcel freight company said in a statement Thursday. “As we navigate an unprecedented business landscape, we are executing the largest network reconfiguration in UPS history” and need to similarly adjust headcount, the company explained.\n\nParcel volumes are under pressure from a variety of headwinds, including Trump administration tariffs that have slowed imports and a January decision to reduce Amazon business by 50% over 18 months because so much of it is unprofitable.\n\nUPS’s voluntary severance plan angered the Teamsters union, which says the Atlanta-based company is obligated to create 30,000 jobs under a five-year contract ratified in August 2023, which forestalled a nationwide strike. It urged members to reject the buyout offer.\n\n“UPS is trying to weasel its way out of creating good union jobs here in America by dangling insulting buyouts in front of Teamsters drivers. It is an illegal violation of our national contract,” said Teamsters President Sean O’Brien in a news release. “UPS is obligated to establish tens of thousands of new full-time jobs under the agreement. But CEO Carol Tomé and UPS’s corporate managers are hoping that if they offer paltry severance packages to enough workers, no one will notice the company is setting the union’s contract on fire. UPS Teamsters work too damn hard to be treated with such disrespect.”\n\nTeamster contracts enable UPS drivers employed 30 years or more to receive employer-paid health care throughout retirement, a benefit that would not be guaranteed to all workers under UPS’s severance plan, according to the union. The current contract calls for UPS to elevate 22,500 part-time workers to full-time positions and create another 7,500 positions.\n\n“We have approached the Teamsters on this topic and remain committed to the agreements we reached in 2023,” UPS said.\n\nThe Teamsters, which represents 340,000 UPS workers,last week accused UPSof failing to comply with the hiring requirement and a commitment to provide 28,000 air conditioned package cars and vans for heat relief in many parts of the country. It requested data from UPS on the status of open positions, as well as the delivery rate for vehicles equipped with air conditioning. The Teamsters gave the company until July 1 to provide answers, but the company has requested additional time to respond, the union said.\n\n“Our members cannot be bought off and we will not allow them to be sold out. The Teamsters are prepared to fight UPS on every front with every available resource to shut down this illegal buyout program,” O’Brien said. “UPS needs to live up to the existing contract. They must honor their commitments, just as Teamsters do every day, reliably delivering packages to hundreds of millions of Americans. Profits are not more important than people, not at UPS or any other employer.”\n\nUPS executives said during April’s earnings presentation that the company expects to save more than $1.2 billion this year by eliminating 25 million operating hours across the workforce. A similar amount in semi-variable cost reductions are estimated from the reduction of 20,000 employees.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves\/PostalMag stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nTeamsters complain UPS slow to deploy air conditioned vehicles\n\nSwitch to UPS saved US Postal Service 43% in air transport costs\n\nUPS to eliminate 20K jobs as Amazon decoupling accelerates\n\nThe postUPS drivers to receive buyout offer as company shrinks parcel networkappeared first onFreightWaves.",

    "News_title":"Before Joe Louis became an American icon, Jack Johnson shook up the nation on July 4, 1910",
    "News_text":"The date was July 4, 1910, the location was Reno, Nevada, and the event scheduled to take place was billed as the “Fight of the Century.”\n\nRoughly 20,000 people packed into a newly built, massive amphitheater to see Jack Johnson, the first Black world heavyweight champion of the world, defend his title against former champion James J. Jeffries. In addition, tens of thousands more gathered at locations across the country to receive telegraph-generated reports as the battle played out.\n\nPopular gathering spots away from Reno on that Monday holiday included downtown Detroit, where an estimated 5,000 people “jammed together in the form of a huge letter ‘V’” to hear reports that were streaming from the offices of the former Detroit Evening Times, as the publication reported on June 5, 1910.\n\nHowever, the action that took place inside the boxing ring that day hardly matched the buzz felt outside of it, as Jeffries, who had been encouraged to come out of retirement by the legendary novelist Jack London and many others to return the heavyweight crown to the “white race,” was easily defeated by Johnson. With Jeffries bleeding badly from cuts over an eye and in his mouth, and with the other eye nearly swollen shut, the fighting in the ring ended in the 15th round, during which Jeffries was knocked down three times by Johnson.\n\nBut then the real Fourth of July fireworks began afterward in the form of race riots “in all parts of the country,” where “scores of negroes were injured seriously, and eight negroes were killed outright,” according to the New York Times’ July 5, 1910, front page.\n\n“The picture that many people have today of riots are of the urban uprisings of the late 1960s, but the race riots following that fight on Independence Day 1910 were actually white attacks inflicted by mobs of folk because Johnson’s victory was a betrayal of white social assumptions,” Theresa Runstedtler, author of “Jack Johnson, Rebel Sojourner: Boxing in the Shadow of the Global Color Line” (UC Press, 2012) explained. “At that time, boxing was one of the premier, if notthepremier spectator sport with fights held in massive arenas. And the world heavyweight championship was viewed as the epitome of white manhood. So for Jack Johnson and later Joe Louis to step into that role it was symbolically a hard pill to swallow for many.”\n\nIn addition to the violence and heightened racial tensions that resulted immediately after the Johnson-Jeffries fight, the outcome also had a lingering impact on who would be able to fight for the heavyweight crown in the future. After Johnson’s reign as the world heavyweight champion ended following his loss to Jess Willard in Havana, Cuba on April 5, 1915, a Black fighter was not granted another opportunity to fight for the world heavyweight crown until June 22, 1937 when Louis knocked out James J. Braddock before more than 40,000 fans at Comiskey Park, the original home of the Chicago White Sox.\n\nMore:Riley: Detroit cements honor for Joe Louis with a giant greenway around the city\n\nDetroit’s Brewster Recreation Center is credited as the place where Louis received his formal start in boxing, and the Detroit Golden Gloves tournament—sponsored by the Free Press during the 1930s—provided a platform where Louis continued to hone his skills as an amateur. But Runstedtler says it took some shrewd maneuvering outside of the ring once Louis turned pro to place him in a position to fight for the heavyweight crown, which set the stage for the iconic status that Louis still holds today in Detroit and across America.\n\n“Joe Louis was marketed very strategically by his Black braintrust,” said Runstedtler, an Ontario native and full professor in the Departments of History and Critical Race, Gender & Cultural Studies at American University, who authored the scholarly article “In Sports the Best Man Wins: How Joe Louis Whupped Jim Crow.”\n\nMore:3 unique installations in Michigan make list of must-sees for art lovers\n\nOn the afternoon of July 1, in explaining how Louis was “marketed to White America” as a professional boxer, Runstedtler referenced the famous “rules,” also known as “Joe Louis’ Seven Commandments” that were supposedly given to Louis by his co-managers Julian Black and John Roxborough to navigate Louis’ public image. The “Joe Louis Seven Commandments” stated that Louis would: “Never have his photo taken with a white woman. Never go to a nightclub alone. Never have a “soft” fight. Never fix a fight. Never gloat over a fallen opponent. Always stay deadpan for the cameras. Live and fight clean.”\n\nThe actions taken by Louis’s managers to make the commandments known to the media and public helped to portray Louis as the antithesis of Johnson, whose lifestyle often garnered more attention than his boxing ability. And judging from the outcome, Louis' managers carried out a winning plan.\n\n“For Joe Louis to be embraced as an American icon, as an African American, and to be recognized as a symbol of American grit with working class appeal, that was unprecedented,” stated Runstedtler, who says the zenith of Louis’ popularity came after Louis’ first-round destruction of German Max Schmeling in their second fight on June 22, 1938 at New York’s Yankee Stadium, which was called a blow to Nazism and a victory for democracy.\n\nBut Runstedtler also points out that a deeper dive into history reveals similarities shared by Louis and Johnson, who was posthumously pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2018, 105 years after Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann Act for transporting a white woman, who later became his wife, across state lines. More than just a Black man who was bold enough to display his interracial relationships during the early 20th century, Runstedtler describes Johnson as a “global celebrity” who sparked heated debates about racism and imperialism on a global stage. And in the process, Runstedtler says Johnson became a hero to oppressed people across the globe, even as far away as Australia where Johnson was looked up to by Aboriginal Austrailians in Sydney, where Johnson won the world heavyweight title from Canadian Tommy Burns on December 26, 1908. Runstedtler says that a study of stories written about Louis in the Black Press during his boxing heyday reveals that he, too, was admired in different ways than Louis’ normal  mainstream portrayal.\n\n“Joe Louis represented different things to different people and this was true even for the Black community, depending on a person’s age,” Runstedtler stated. “Many in the younger generation liked the idea that he was often beating the crap out of white men. And that he was stylish and embodied an air of class, Black independence and Black self-determination. The older generation admired many of those qualities as well, but for some it was more important that Joe Louis represented respectability.\n\n“Personality wise, Jack Johnson and Joe Louis were definitely different, but in some ways they had more in common than their differences because of the shared challenges that they took on in and out of the ring. And because of that their stories still inspire us today.”\n\nScott Talley is a native Detroiter, a proud product of Detroit Public Schools and a lifelong lover of Detroit culture in its diverse forms.

    "News_text":"IsraelioutletsreportedThursday that Hamas leaders had signaled an openness to a ceasefire deal with Israel brokered by Trump administration envoys.\n\nNews of the potential 60-day ceasefire was announced by President Donald Trump in a Truth Socialposton Tuesday stating that Israeli diplomats had “agreed to the necessary conditions to finalize” the deal.\n\n“I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better — IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE,\" the president wrote.\n\nIf successful, the ceasefire would be seen by some as another data point in favor of the Trump administration’s “peace through strength” approach to foreign policy that has yielded a string of recent results.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mediated a peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, marking an unprecedented step toward ending what the United Nations hasdubbed“one of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.”\n\nA few days earlier, Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel which both countries have so far continued to honor following Trump’s decision to drop around a dozen bombs on Iranian military sites in an effort to destroy its nuclear weapons program.\n\n“Our man in the arena is the very best,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last week at a Western Governors’ Association meeting. “We see this moving out across the world, working to secure world peace but through strength.”\n\nThe president’s campaign promise to end American involvement in “forever wars” has taken a number of different forms as global conflicts have escalated, ranging from Trump threatening to depose Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, and decisions to pause weapon transfers to Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House said it would halt the delivery of air defense systems and precision-guided missiles to Ukraine out of concerns from the Defense Department that U.S. stockpiles are running low.\n\nTrump had a nearly one-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, according to TheNew York Times, where the leaders discussed Iran and Ukraine.\n\n“I didn’t make any progress with him at all,” Trump said, according to the Times.\n\nRussian foreign policy officials told reporters that Putin called for diplomatic resolutions to Iran’s nuclear enrichment efforts, and reaffirmed his uncompromising view on the war in Ukraine, the Times reported.\n\nTrump reportedly “raised the question of the quick end to the military action,” according to Russia’s top foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov.\n\nCritics of the Trump administration have alleged that the president’s approach to Putin has been too generous while his interventions in the Middle East have risked exacerbating instability in the region.\n\nMany of these criticisms focus on Trump’s unprecedented treatment of foreign policy procedures, sometimes undermining allies’ plans or his own advisers.\n\n“His approach has sown confusion within his administration and distrust abroad,”wrotegeostrategist Brahma Chellaney on Thursday. “Allies are left wondering whether Trump’s statements reflect official policy or personal whim, and even his own Cabinet is often in the dark.”\n\nTop Republican members of Congress and State Department officials were caught off guard by Trump’s Tuesday decision to hold weapon shipments to Ukraine, Politicoreported.\n\nWhen asked about the goals of America’s bombing campaign in Iran on June 22, Vice President JD Vance said “we don’t want to achieve regime change.”\n\nA few hours later Trumppostedon Truth Social, “It’s not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???”\n\nSome point to Trump’slive narrationof military action against Iran as a potential source of frustration for Israel because it may have given Iran a chance to move enriched uranium from their nuclear sites before they were bombed.\n\nOthers, including former Trump national security adviser Robert O’Brien, have argued that the president’s willingness to make tough decisions to support American interests like he did in Iran will ultimately strengthen America’s standing on the world stage.\n\n“President (Trump) is delivering a master class on how to conduct an America First foreign policy,” O’Brienwroteearlier this month. “(Trump) has gracefully given an enemy multiple chances to avoid war. But because he puts America First, Trump is never going to allow the regime that chanted “DEATH TO AMERICA” for 40 yrs, killed hundreds of our servicemen & threatened our leader to get a nuclear bomb.\"",

    "News_title":"Are we in a moment of crisis?",
    "News_text":"The specter of a constitutional crisis has haunted more than one American presidency. From the Civil War to Bush v. Gore, moments of institutional stress have provoked warnings that the Constitution itself might be faltering. In recent years, that phrase — “constitutional crisis” — has become a staple of the national conversation, debated so often in op-eds, podcasts, and cable news segments that it risks becoming cliché. But what does a true constitutional crisis actually look like? And are we living through one now?\n\nWe asked three legal thinkers — each with a distinct worldview and constitutional philosophy — to wrestle with that question. Their answers are surprising, provocative and not uniform.\n\nFormer federal judge Thomas Griffith offers a deeply personal reading of the crisis. After decades working within the system — as Senate counsel, appellate judge and teacher — he’s come to see the Constitution’s most radical promise not in its checks and balances, but in its blueprint for unity. Griffith argues that the true constitutional emergency isn’t institutional overreach — it’s toxic polarization. And the framers, he believes, left us a roadmap out.\n\nIlya Shapiro, of the Manhattan Institute, challenges the premise altogether. What some interpret as crisis, he argues, may be the product of a hyperpolarized political culture now overlaying — and distorting — judicial interpretation.\n\nNoah Feldman, a Harvard law professor and scholar of constitutional history, looks at the question through an unexpected lens: Latter-day Saint theology. He finds in that religious tradition not only a belief that the Constitution is divinely inspired, but a moral imperative to defend its protections for all flesh — citizen and noncitizen alike — especially in moments of strain.\n\nTogether, these essays don’t deliver a tidy answer. They offer something better: a serious and conflicting set of diagnoses from minds deeply immersed in the Constitution’s design and purpose. The result is a portrait of a system under pressure — and a debate about where we go from here.\n\nBy Thomas B. Griffith\n\nI missed it. Although it was always right before me for decades, I totally missed the most important purpose of the Constitution.\n\nI’ve been an eager student of the American Constitution since high school. I dutifully and happily carry my pocket copy of the Constitution with me wherever I go. Though not a scholar, I read what the best scholars of the Constitution have to teach us about this remarkable document. In my spare time, I listen to podcasts and read books and articles about the Constitution. In my legal career, I’ve been the chief lawyer for the United States Senate, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and currently am a lecturer in law at a law school. Each of these positions required that I study the Constitution.\n\nAnd in my study, I had always assumed that the Constitution was created to protect our rights — and it does — and to create a federal government of enumerated and limited powers — and it does. But what I had not realized until recently is that an even more fundamental purpose of the Constitution and the chief aim of its drafters in 1787 is to show us something about which its framers cared deeply and should speak to us with great force today: how to get along with people with whom we disagree. In other words, the Constitution can show us how to get out of the mess we are in.\n\nAdd me to the list of those who argue that the nation is facing a constitutional crisis. In fact, the crisis I see is the most serious threat to the Constitution since the Civil War. But this crisis is not about the power of the president or the roles of Congress and the courts. It’s not about a threat to the freedom of speech, the free exercise of religion, or equality of opportunity. Those are vital principles and precious rights about which we must always be vigilant. The crisis that threatens the Constitution is the toxic political polarization that has beset the nation in recent years. Ironically, much of that polarization is driven by people who think that they are defending the Constitution, but who miss its primary purpose the way I had. When their zeal is fueled by contempt for those with whom they disagree, their words and actions become a threat to the Constitution.\n\nSocial science research supports what we have all experienced firsthand. Too much of our public discourse is animated by contempt. As Arthur Brooks notes, “Political scientists find that our nation is more polarized than it has been at any time since the Civil War.” Recent surveys show that the level of enmity between Republicans and Democrats in America today approaches the levels between Protestants and Catholics during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and between Palestinians and Israelis today. We aren’t accustomed to think of ourselves in that company, but here we are.\n\nOver 70 percent of Republicans think that Democrats are “immoral.” Over 60 percent of Democrats think the same of Republicans. Such contempt is a cancer on the body politic. As the late conservative columnist Michael Gerson noted, “(The Constitution) is designed for vigorous disagreement. It is not designed for irreconcilable contempt.” The social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, not one prone to apocalyptic forecasts, predicts, “(T)here is a very good chance that ... we will have a catastrophic failure of our democracy.” The reason? “We just don’t know what a democracy looks like when you drain all trust out of the system.” Actually, we do know what that looks like: the January 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nBut there is good news. A large majority of Americans are tired of this toxic polarization, and there is a way out. In fact, the Constitution itself and the way it was created provide a road map forward.\n\nAs Yuval Levin points out in his paradigm-shifting book, “American Covenant: How the Constitution Unified Our Nation — And Could Again” (the most important book on the Constitution I’ve ever read), the Constitution is an answer to the question of how the people of a nation as diverse as ours can act together even though we don’t think alike. The preamble to the Constitution announces its purpose is to “form a more perfect union.” The first third of the Federalist Papers are primarily about how the Constitution can help us achieve unity among people with differing views. “(C)reating common ground,” Levin notes, “is a key purpose of the Constitution. ... It does so by compelling Americans with different views and priorities to deal with one another — to compete, negotiate, and build coalitions in ways that drag us into common action even (indeed, especially) when we disagree.”\n\nAnd this is done through the structure of the government the Constitution creates. The discussion during the Constitutional Convention in 1787 was primarily about the best structure of the government they were creating and how it might achieve national unity amid diversity. There was precious little discussion that summer about rights. (Fortunately, that would come four years later with the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution.)\n\nThink for a moment about the structure of the national government the Constitution creates. It’s terribly complicated. Law is made by the common action of three different institutions — the House of Representatives, the Senate and the presidency — chosen by different groups of people at different times. Anyone who has worked for the passage of a bill will attest to how difficult it is for a proposal to run this gauntlet and become law. This system is not built for efficiency. It is built to slow down proposals in hopes that any law that emerges will be carefully considered and the result of negotiation and compromise among the elected representatives of “We the people.”\n\nAbsent the rare landslide election that sweeps into power a president whose party has large majorities in both houses of Congress, the only thing one wins in an election to the House, the Senate or the presidency is a seat at the negotiating table where you must bargain with others whose support you need. Of course that support comes at a cost. We call that compromise.\n\nThe Constitution requires a different type of citizen than had ever been seen before on the world stage. A citizen who is willing to listen to his or her opponents, understand their concerns, and then be willing to compromise so that, to the extent possible, the various sides can find some common ground. Each side will have to give up something — those in the minority more than the majority. But that’s the genius of the Constitution. As Levin puts it, this complex process of lawmaking “compels Americans to be a little more accommodating of one another. It gives us practical experience in living and acting together.”\n\nThe most succinct description I have heard of what the Constitution requires of a citizen comes from President Dallin H. Oaks. Oaks is not only a leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but he is also one of the most widely respected scholars of the Constitution, having been a state Supreme Court justice and a professor of law at the University of Chicago before taking on his ecclesiastical responsibilities. In remarks on the Constitution that he gave to a worldwide assembly of the church in April 2021, President Oaks declared that “on contested issues, we should seek to moderate and to unify.” In a speech given at the University of Virginia later that year, President Oaks explained that the structure of the government the Constitution created could only work if there was good faith negotiation and mutual accommodation among citizens of differing views. And as he told former federal judge and Dean Emeritus David Levi in an interview in Judicature, it is antithetical to the Constitution to “expect or seek total dominance for our own positions.”\n\nA large majority of Americans are tired of this toxic polarization, and there is a way out. In fact, the Constitution itself and the way it was created provide a road map forward.\n\nSignificantly, this understanding of the purpose of the Constitution also describes the way it was created in the first instance at the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Those who created the government that requires good faith negotiation and mutual accommodation practiced what they preached.\n\nBy July 1787, it appeared that the work of the convention would fail. No agreement had been reached, and there was serious talk of delegates leaving for home. And yet by September, the delegates had cobbled together a Constitution. So unlikely was this turn of events that one popular history of the convention is titled “Miracle at Philadelphia.” I am a Christian, and I believe in miracles. But my understanding is that a miracle is an event that defies rational explanation, such as the parting of the waves during the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, or the resurrection of Jesus. By this definition, no miracle took place in the summer of 1787. We know exactly how the delegates succeeded because George Washington told us. In his letter transmitting the proposed Constitution to the Confederation Congress, Washington wrote, “The Constitution, which we now present, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession, which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.” Amity, mutual deference, concession. The delegates in Philadelphia practiced these virtues for the sake of creating a “more perfect union.”\n\nLegal scholar Derek Webb has done a deep dive into the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention to understand what Washington meant by amity, mutual deference and concession. The rules of the convention assumed that if you could gather together a group of people in the same room and have them listen to one another, they would change their minds, and that would be a very good thing. The delegates took their meals together in small groups that had people from South Carolina breaking bread with men from Massachusetts and discovering over time that they had more in common with one another than they had supposed.\n\nAnd there was much socializing among the delegates that summer. At key points in the summer, when tensions among delegates were on the rise, Benjamin Franklin threw lavish parties for them at his home and brought out his fine stock of port wine, which was gleefully enjoyed by all. All of this — the rules, the dinners, the parties — created an atmosphere in which the delegates, in the words of George Mason, grew “into some acquaintance with each other” and formed “a proper correspondence of sentiments.” In other words, they became friends who were willing to engage in good faith negotiations and seek mutual accommodations for the sake of unity. But they didn’t reach unity out of the goodness of their hearts alone. They did so because their backs were against the wall. Failure to reach compromise would have posed an existential threat to the new nation. As Washington put it, “the peculiarities of our political situation rendered (this approach) indispensable.”\n\nIs that where we are as a people today? I’m afraid so. That’s the bad news. But here’s the good news. We know how to overcome the toxic polarization that threatens our nation. It’s hard work, and it requires all of us to take to heart President Oaks’ charge, which is the charge of the Constitution itself, that “on contested issues, we should seek to moderate and to unify.”\n\nThomas B. Griffith was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by President George W. Bush in 2005. He retired from the D.C. Circuit in 2020 and is currently a lecturer at Harvard law school and a fellow at the Wheatley Institute at Brigham Young University.\n\nBy Ilya Shapiro\n\nWe didn’t get very far into the second Trump administration before political commentators started wringing their hands about this or that “constitutional crisis” that we’d stumbled into. Pundits took to the airwaves to allege that letting Elon Musk wreak havoc over federal agencies was the end of the republic, while law professors took to the op-ed pages to explain how the lack of due process in the administration’s deportation policy signaled our slide toward authoritarianism. And then ... the laptop class moved on to worrying about their 401(k)s in the face of tariff uncertainty and the political class to squabbling over the budget bill.\n\nSo were the crises averted? Did we survive to engage in our tribal fights another day, or is the danger still roiling in the background as the nation teeters on a precipice, metaphorically approaching midnight like a Doomsday Clock for the rule of law?\n\nThe answer depends on what you mean by all these weighty terms. A constitutional crisis is generally thought of as a problem in governmental operations or conflict between branches of power that a country’s foundational law is unable to resolve. Such a crisis can arise when the constitution fails, or is perceived as approaching failure, to give guidance to political actors regarding a contested situation — or those actors simply ignore it.\n\nSometimes constitutional mechanisms lead to political instability or other circumstances that lead political actors to contest each other’s legitimacy. Such was the case when the 1796 election resulted in a president (John Adams) and vice president (Thomas Jefferson) from different parties, and when Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr got the same number of electoral college votes in 1800. The rules were clear, but endangered stable governance, so the 12th Amendment was enacted to separate electoral votes for president and vice president.\n\nAt other times, the Constitution is legally ambiguous about an unforeseen circumstance, so a practical resolution — what law professors call “liquidation” — sets the precedent for averting future crises. For example, in 1841, it was unclear when William Henry Harrison died 31 days into his presidency whether John Tyler actually succeeded him or just became “acting president.” Tyler took the oath of office and thus settled the matter. (Tyler was politically enfeebled during his term because he lacked a base of support in either party in Congress — he was called “His Accidency” — but that’s a quirk of that era’s partisan flux and not any constitutional weakness.)\n\nA constitutional crisis could lead to governmental paralysis or collapse, democratic backsliding or even civil war. Indeed, by far the greatest crisis the United States ever faced involved Southern states’ rejection of Abraham Lincoln’s policies against the expansion of slavery, instead choosing to secede. Lincoln in turn refused to recognize the breakaway republic and brought the Confederate states back into the union by bloody force. One hopes that we’ll never have to test that “resolution” of the Constitution’s silence regarding secession.\n\nBut constitutional crises don’t have to rise to the level of Ken Burns documentaries. It’s not hard to conjure scenarios about which the Constitution would be ambiguous at best, or which opportunistic politicians would take advantage of to create doubts about the legitimacy of their rivals. Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt wrote a book in 2012 that lays out half a dozen hypothetical crises. “Constitutional Cliffhangers” discusses complications that could arise from:\n\nA president being criminally prosecuted.\n\nA president pardoning himself.\n\nCabinet members trying to oust a “disabled” president, who then tries to oust them.\n\nThe House speaker and secretary of state fighting for the presidency in the wake of the deaths of the president and vice president.\n\nAn ex-president being impeached.\n\nA two-term president trying to stay in power.\n\nSome of these don’t sound so fanciful after the political twists and turns of the last couple of decades, really dating back to Bush v. Gore in 2000, which wasn’t so much a crisis as a statistical tie for one state’s electors. But they all involve the office of the presidency rather than how the holder of that office wields his power. Those complaining about President Donald Trump don’t dispute his claim on the White House — this time around — but do accuse him of abusing his powers to the point of governing like the king who forced the hand of the founding generation to declare independence. One could certainly call the American Revolution a product of crisis in the British (unwritten) constitution.\n\nAfter all, the argument goes, firing agency heads, shuttering USAID, withholding funds that Congress appropriated, reversing environmental regulations by fiat, targeting law firms whose lawyers represent political adversaries, and putting the nation’s leading universities into federal receivership at the stroke of a hostile letter are all examples of an executive acting without any respect for legal or constitutional processes. Add in such things as unilaterally defining terms like “woman” and “gender” across the federal government — plus rescinding not just Biden or Obama executive orders on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), but LBJ’s order on affirmative action — and you have, on this view, a president acting like the dictator he once mused himself to be.\n\nThe funny thing about all these examples is that institutional guardrails have held, just as they did in Trump’s first term with regard to the “travel ban” and other things that led to cries of constitutional crisis. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed on a host of issues, with injunctions against some actions and the administration ultimately winning its fair share of rulings. Some of these issues pose open or at least contested legal questions. For example, it’s likely that next year the Supreme Court will overturn Humphrey’s Executor, the 1935 case that insulates the heads of “independent” agencies from presidential control. Other issues are just a manifestation of the “pen and phone” governance patterned by President Barack Obama, which accelerated the shift to our current populist moment. You live by the executive order, you die by the executive order.\n\nMoreover, as singular an individual as Donald Trump may be, he’s not unique when it comes to pushing the envelope of executive power. President Joe Biden was judicially slapped down on issues ranging from vaccination mandates and eviction moratoria to environmental rules and student loan forgiveness — and even after the Supreme Court blocked his student loan plan, he kept trying to do the same thing using other statutory workarounds. Biden also, a few days before the end of his term, issued a bizarre declaration that the Equal Rights Amendment had been ratified, which the National Archives promptly rejected.\n\nWhat we have isn’t so much a constitutional crisis but legal manifestations of the political-cultural “vibe shift” we’ve been talking about since last November’s election.\n\nThere may be two novel examples of blatant Trumpian disregard for the constitutional order, but they don’t fit the crisis narrative because of their heterodox ideological valences. I’m thinking of the unilateral pausing of bipartisan legislation requiring the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok — which law survived Supreme Court review — and the “emergency” tariffs levied on the entire world. But even here, presidents of both parties have used the awesome tariff power that Congress delegated to them, with the judiciary’s acquiescence. So all of our constitutional branches seem complicit, but none of that threatens to destabilize the republic (as opposed to our economy) or lead to a cold civil war.\n\nBut what about more blatant disregard to the rule of law, such as the treatment of judicial orders regarding the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia or the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, or the revocation of hundreds of student visas over speech that the administration doesn’t like? Each of these examples is also legally contestable. For example, can a court order the president or his agents to engage in diplomacy, even if it wouldn’t be a big lift? Is it showing contempt to argue that a district court lacks jurisdiction when the Supreme Court ultimately agrees that habeas corpus claims must be filed where detainees are held? Can the United States not apply the rules regarding the visa ineligibility of foreigners who espouse certain disqualifying ideologies when those foreigners are already in the country?\n\nSure, it isn’t helpful to our political culture for a president and members of his administration to show disdain for or call for the impeachment of judges who rule against them. And the coy “after you, my dear Alphonse” dance performed by Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office thumbed its nose at the spirit, if not the letter, of the order requiring the government to “facilitate” Garcia’s return. But there’s been nothing like Andrew Jackson’s exclamation, “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!” — which even if apocryphal reflected Old Hickory’s opinion of judicial authority. And how do you weigh Trump’s behavior against attacks on the Supreme Court by the Biden administration — leading both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris to endorse court-packing — and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s threats against two justices if they ruled the wrong way on abortion? Or, more recently, Democratic lawmakers’ storming of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility and then claiming their arrests were somehow illegitimate?\n\n“They’re all bad” is a fair response, but “bad” does not a crisis make. A lot of what’s going on in the courts, for example, is procedural skirmishes over the proper scope and appealability of temporary restraining orders, or the propriety of nationwide or “universal” injunctions. The Supreme Court has been remiss in not giving lower courts more guidance on these technical issues — Chief Justice John Roberts’ project to keep the court out of the political discourse has backfired repeatedly — so it was heartening to see it take up the injunction issue, with a decision expected by the end of its current term in June or early July. (That argument was in the context of Trump’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship for children of people here temporarily or illegally. At least one law professor who worked in the Biden Justice Department has called that order a constitutional crisis in and of itself, but even as the longstanding practice to the contrary is clear, the meaning of the 14th Amendment isn’t.)\n\nIn short, what we have isn’t so much a constitutional crisis but legal manifestations of the political-cultural “vibe shift” we’ve been talking about since last November’s election. Courts are still more respected than any other part of government at a time of historically low societal trust, and confidence in the Supreme Court is still high relative to its coequal branches, but that’s despite the historically large difference in opinion by partisanship or ideology.\n\nIt’s apparent that Americans — especially American elites — have conflicting constitutional visions, and what we’ve seen lately is the confluence of trends where divergent interpretive theories map onto partisan preference at a time when the parties are more polarized and ideologically sorted than any time since at least the Civil War. There’s no easy way to “liquidate” those kinds of differences.\n\nIlya Shapiro is director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute and author, most recently, of “Lawless: The Miseducation of America’s Elites.” He also writes the Shapiro’s Gavel newsletter on Substack.\n\nBy Noah Feldman\n\nAmong the many fascinating and rich beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have always been especially engaged by the teaching that the U.S. Constitution is divinely inspired. Perhaps this is because I am, by profession, a teacher of constitutional law. For someone who has dedicated much of his life to studying the Constitution, there is something hopeful in the belief that it is part of a divine plan. When our constitutional traditions and values seem to be faltering, or when they face especially difficult tests and challenges, a degree of faith in the underlying endeavor of constitutional democracy can be particularly valuable.\n\nThis is one of those times. Since his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump, sworn to uphold the Constitution, has repeatedly taken unilateral executive actions that federal courts have determined to violate the letter and spirit of our foundational document and the laws duly enacted pursuant to it. These range from violations of the individual rights of people in the United States to violations of the separation of powers to violations of the rule of law, the underlying principle of the Constitution itself.\n\nTo be clear: This is not normal. The challenge to the Constitution, its norms and its values that we are currently facing is without precedent. Many presidents have occasionally taken actions reversed by the courts as unconstitutional. Congress has very occasionally passed laws that were struck down on constitutional grounds. But no previous president has acted similarly, taking scores of actions in a short period of time that, in the estimation of the courts, directly violated the Constitution and the laws.\n\nThe question therefore arises: What is the appropriate response to unprecedented challenge to constitutional norms at the highest level of the U.S. government? At the legal level, the answer is relatively simple. Affected parties can and should go to court to vindicate not only their rights, but the Constitution and the rule of law that it embodies. Courts should hear those claims, consider them in the light of the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, and rule accordingly. Then, all citizens must stand up for the Constitution as interpreted by the courts, insisting that the president and other executive branch officials comply with lawful court orders.\n\nWhat, though, is the right moral answer to the question of how to respond to unconstitutional conduct and attitudes? To address this question, which is more profound than the legal one, we need to understand the moral basis for the Constitution and its values.\n\nIn my view, there is no single moral theory of the Constitution that can be identified as definitively correct — at least in constitutional terms. Even if one believes in a single, unified, true morality, applying it to the Constitution will still be a matter of interpretation in which disagreement between reasonable people of goodwill is still possible.\n\nI have long been intrigued by one such interpretation, of one moral vision of constitutional purpose, expressed in terms of and grounded in Latter-day Saint doctrine and teaching. That interpretation begins with a universalist, inclusive ethic of constitutional purpose, as opposed to a narrow, nationalist one focused only on U.S. citizens and their interests. From there, it proceeds to the principles of judicial independence and the rule of law, conceived as necessary instruments for facilitating the universal vision.\n\nThis vision should be of interest not only to Latter-day Saint believers, but to people like me who do not belong to the faith, but who are committed to constitutional values and want our Constitution to have good moral reasons to exist and to survive.\n\nA good place to start is an important address delivered in April 2021 by President Dallin H. Oaks, first counselor in the First Presidency of the church, delivered during its semiannual general conference under the title “Defending Our Divinely Inspired Constitution.”\n\nFirst, a quick disclaimer: It is always tricky for someone who is not an adherent of a particular faith tradition to explicate a profoundly religious text. I offer my interpretation and application of President Oaks’ teaching in humility and respect for President Oaks and for the church, noting the obvious truth that I can in no way claim my reading is a faithful one, but can only pray that I have captured something of the spirit that, to my mind at least, permeates the speech.\n\nIn presenting the idea of the divinely inspired Constitution, President Oaks focuses not on Doctrine and Covenants 101:80, a very clear and direct statement of the Constitution’s divine inspiration, but another Latter-day Saint scripture (D&C 101:77), which refers to “the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles.”\n\nHere I want to emphasize a remarkable aspect of this verse: its universality. God says he intends the Constitution to protect “all flesh” — not just Americans or citizens of the United States. The resonant phrase “all flesh” is the biblical language most often used to invoke all humanity, regardless of belonging or membership. Consider, for example, Isaiah 66:23: “And it shall come to pass, that every new moon, and every sabbath, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the Lord.” In Isaiah’s prophetic vision, just one verse after God has promised to make “the new heavens and the new earth,” all humans shall be united as one in the worship of the Lord.\n\nWhat does this mean in our current moment? It means, I would like to propose, that our Constitution does not simply protect U.S. citizens. It protects “all flesh” who live under its jurisdiction. That decisively includes noncitizens present in the United States — who themselves have long been held to possess fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nThis is a very particular moral reading of the Constitution — one that is universalist and inclusive. It is by no means the only way to read the text or the traditions of the Constitution. The notorious Dred Scott decision excluded people of African descent from “We the people,” and was overturned only by the Civil War and the Reconstruction amendments. In a 1990 decision, U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist suggested in nonbinding dicta that perhaps constitutional rights afforded to “the people” might not extend to noncitizens in the U.S.\n\nYet the 14th Amendment specifies that its protections extend to everyone who is a “person.” Thus, rights to life, liberty and property under the 14th Amendment have been held to apply to noncitizens in the United States. Similarly, in 1945, in the case of Bridges v. Wixon, the Supreme Court held that “Freedom of speech and of the press is accorded aliens residing in this country.”\n\nIt is beyond the purview of this essay to address technical issues of when and how fundamental rights protections under the Constitution apply to noncitizens. It should suffice to observe that D&C 101:77, as invoked by President Oaks, offers moral justification for the constitutional idea that all humans under the jurisdiction of the United States deserve protection. Views to the contrary are, I think, inconsistent with the moral vision of a Constitution.\n\nThe lesson is strikingly relevant. Constitutional protection of noncitizens has become an important and controversial topic under the Trump administration. Noncitizens have repeatedly been the targets of executive action, especially summary deportation without a hearing, that have been challenged as unlawful in the federal courts and found to be unlawful. A morally universal, inclusive Constitution requires, I believe, a deep commitment to protecting all people, not only citizens.\n\nFrom the universal moral principle, we can move on to the means of effectuating it. In his speech, President Oaks named “five divinely inspired principles.” These are, in brief, (1) popular sovereignty, (2) federalism, (3) the separation of powers, (4) the fundamental protections of the Bill of Rights, and (5) the Constitution as the embodiment of the rule of law, not of men.\n\nI find it noteworthy that President Oaks considers the separation of powers to be a divinely inspired aspect of the Constitution. As he notes, “the inspiration in the American convention was to delegate independent executive, legislative, and judicial powers so these three branches could exercise checks upon one another.”\n\nIt is through our actions that we will preserve our constitutional republic, or, heaven forbid, lose it.\n\nThe argument here is powerful and original: According to President Oaks, the contribution of American constitutional thought on the separation of powers is the idea of the independence of the different branches. That independence, according to this view, enables the branches to check one another.\n\nMake no mistake, the independence of the judicial branch is under genuine threat today. Repeatedly, the current presidential administration has either violated judicial orders (according to the federal courts) or come so close to doing so that judicial independence is threatened. At one point, the current president, posting on social media, called for the impeachment and removal of a federal district court judge who had issued a temporary restraining order adverse to the administration’s policy. In response, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public statement explaining that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” Roberts, who cares deeply about preserving the independence of the judiciary, understood the president’s statement as seeking to intimidate the judiciary, thus undermining its independence.\n\nLast, and perhaps most important, President Oaks argues for the divine inspiration of the core constitutional principle that “we are to be governed by law and not by individuals.”\n\nAs President Oaks explains, since ours is a government of laws, “our loyalty is to the Constitution and its principles and processes, not to any office holder.” Whatever any president, including President Trump, may say, government employees and we the citizens ourselves do not owe fealty to the president. Our responsibilities and our oaths run to the Constitution, which is itself the supreme law of the land. This principle, alongside the principle that “all persons are to be equal before the law,” President Oaks writes, comes to “block the autocratic ambitions that have corrupted democracy in some countries.”\n\nThis point could hardly be more important for current constitutional conditions. The rule of law, which itself depends in practice on the independence of the different branches of government, exists to protect our freedoms against the power of any one person. The rule of law is intended to block “autocratic ambitions.” The complex of five constitutional values identified by President Oaks as divinely inspired together serve the underlying purpose of the Constitution identified in D&C 101:77, namely the protection of the freedoms of “all flesh.”\n\nOf course, one may accept all President Oaks’ arguments as a matter of political theory and constitutional principle without also embracing his belief, or the church’s doctrine, that the Constitution is divinely inspired. Such belief is, like other religious belief, very much a matter of personal faith and of the individual’s relationship to the concept of divine inspiration itself. As someone who is not a Latter-day Saint, I have no intention to encourage readers to adopt religious beliefs that they do not already have.\n\nAt the same time, I have engaged in the foregoing exegesis of Doctrine and Covenants 101:77 and of President Oaks’ message because I believe, with full faith, that today our Constitution needs all the commitment and assistance it can get. The Constitution today requires support from all sources, human and divine.\n\nIt is through our actions that we will preserve our constitutional republic, or, heaven forbid, lose it. Our fallible human agency means that the decision is in our own hands, as the establishment of the Constitution was in the hands of the framers who created the original compact and the all-important amendments that fulfill its promise by protecting liberty and equality. May we be worthy successors to those who came before us. May we leave to our posterity a Constitution that is worthy of the high aspirations we are bidden to fulfill.\n\nNoah Feldman is Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, chair of the Society of Fellows, and founding director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Program on Jewish and Israeli Law, all at Harvard University.\n\nThis story appears in the July\/August 2025 issue ofDeseretMagazine.Learn more about how to subscribe.",

    "News_text":"U.S. housing crisis sparks boom in crypto-backed mortgagesoriginally appeared onTheStreet.\n\nWith home prices setting new records amid inflation, there is a growing fear that the housing market is forming a bubble and a housing crisis is looming. According to Reventure Consulting's \"U.S. Home Price History: 1890 to 2025,\" home prices in the U.S. reached an all-time high in 2025.\n\nThat exceeds the 2006 high of 266.4, unprecedented affordability headwinds. There were a historically low 1.6 months' worth of homes for sale in the U.S. in January 2022, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).\n\nAccording toreports, this metric represents the number of homes available for sale. As of 2025, while there are significantly more homes today than there were back then, it is not enough to satisfy demand, making prices go up.\n\nA new asset class has emerged as a solution to the housing crisis: cryptocurrency as collateral to secure a mortgage, which opens up new possibilities for homeownership and investment.\n\nSoaring home prices are pricing many buyers out of the market, particularly younger and lower-income households.Tokenized real estateand crypto-backed loans are rapidly changing access points.\n\nThey divide properties into fungible, digitized shares and use blockchain to make them tradable. This makes owning a house accessible to average investors and allows the average person to co-own a piece of real estate without having to make hefty down payments, which may help relieve some demand in the housing market.\n\nOn June 4, JPMorgan Chase started accepting spotBitcoin ETFs as collateral for loans— a decision that could lead to more crypto-backed lending on Wall Street. Global capital is also flowing into the U.S. market via decentralized finance (DeFi). By placing homes on-chain, foreign digital-native investors can indirectly finance new development and lower costs.\n\nMany new organizations, such asLedn, Milo, USDC.homes, etc., have been pioneering the crypto mortgage movement. According toNational Mortgage Professional, Milo has reported over $65 million in crypto loan mortgages across its various loan products.\n\nInterestingly, Maple Financesurged past $1 billionin assets under management in 2025, establishing itself as DeFi's premier institutional lending marketplace.\n\nLedn co-founder Mauricio Di Bartolomeo told TheStreetRoundtablethat U.S. regulators had sparked a \"Cambrian explosion\" inBitcoin-backed lending. The use of blockchain-based smart contracts increases efficiencies, as these agreements are self-executing. Smart contracts can automate the terms of a loan, reducing paperwork.\n\nHowever, havingcryptocurrency as collateral for a mortgagehas its risks: the extreme volatility of pricing can expose parties to margin calls, most loans require over-collateralization, and the list of assets acceptable as collateral is limited.\n\nRates are often higher than conventional mortgages, funds are held with custodians (locked), and regulatory uncertainty provides no standard protection or guarantees to borrowers.\n\nAs the housing crisis deepens, the intersection of traditional finance and innovation within blockchain could be a valuable tool for addressing the problem.\n\nU.S. housing crisis sparks boom in crypto-backed mortgagesfirst appeared on TheStreet on Jul 3, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported byTheStreeton Jul 3, 2025, where it first appeared.",

    "News_text":"Independence Day, you’re a firework.\n\nThousands of spectators gathered across the Big Apple were awed at the patriotic pyrotechnic miracle of the 49th Annual Macy’s 4th of July fireworks show — a spectacle that unleashed a flood of emotions Friday night.\n\nThe celebration, which kicked off at 9:25 p.m., featured 80,000 shells launched in the night sky from four barges on the East River — including a ghost shell that rocketed 1,000 feet in the air — and an unprecedented art show projected on the majestic Brooklyn Bridge.\n\n“Thank you, Macy’s, every year for what you do. I’m crying. Yes. I’m crying. This is New York City. This doesn’t happen this way, anywhere else,” Brooklynite Maribel Abreu, 54, told The Post as she wiped tears from her eyes at South Street Seaport’s Pier 17.\n\n“There’s (nothing) more beautiful than the Brooklyn Bridge in the world, and the bridge was on fire today.”\n\nSherrie Hughes, 40, an Army veteran who fought in Afghanistan and was visiting from California, summed up the fraternal spirit shared among onlookers from around the city — and the world — created by the breathtaking show.\n\n“There is no other place like New York City to celebrate the spirit of America,” Hughes, a former New Yorker, said.\n\n“This seemed purposeful.”\n\nThe fireworks extravaganza was a much-needed distraction from the “climate we’re in right now. We all need to unite as a people, and all come together, and all celebrate together,” added Hughes, whose favorite part was the explosions that looked like a waterfall cascading from the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River below.\n\nAnd she wasn’t the only one deeply stirred by that stunning display.\n\n“The waterfall was insane. It’s probably one of the best fireworks that’s ever happened in New York. It is probably, like, the best event ever. … Incredible show. Just incredible,” Abreu’s 16-year-old son, Maxwell Lizardi, gushed.\n\nSol Pereya traveled from Cordoba, Argentina, with her parents and brother specifically to see this year’s fireworks.\n\n“We knew that this was very special and very unique, so we tried to do everything to schedule everything to be here today,” the 27-year-old said.\n\nHer family was so touched that they huddled together in the middle of the show and told each other how much they loved each other.\n\n“I think that we will treasure this moment for the rest of our lives, honestly,” an emotional Pereya said. “The Brooklyn Bridge, it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. We’re still trying to figure out the words to describe it.”\n\nMany longtime New Yorkers who were among the throng of onlookers come to see the show noted that they don’t remember fireworks ever being shot off the Brooklyn Bridge before Friday night’s display.\n\nArbeu and Lizardi watched with astonishment as an American flag projected on one of the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge unfurled in a scroll before it was replaced by an American eagle that soared over an open road.",

    "News_title":"Trump got $170 billion for immigration. Now he has to enact it.",
    "News_text":"President Donald Trump’s megabill with $170 billion for border and immigration enforcement squeaked through Congress after days ofpromises, arm twistingand implicit threats to wavering members.\n\nNow — the clock is ticking to spend the money.\n\nThe Trump administration has three-and-a-half years to drastically expand the nation’s border enforcement and deportation infrastructure, a massive logistical challenge for which there is no easy comparison. It must hire and train thousands of new immigration officials, secure contracts to ramp up detention capacity and expand the immigration court system. All of that is in pursuit of an ambitious White House target: 1 million annual deportations.\n\nThe megabill, which the president signed into law Friday, offers an unprecedented infusion of cash into the country’s immigration enforcement apparatus, but even Trump border czar Tom Homan acknowledges the administration has a great deal of work ahead, especially when it comes to fulfilling Trump’s pledge to hire 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\n“Look, this isn’t easy. Ten thousand ICE officers? Never happened before,” Homan told POLITICO on Friday. “But I’ll say this: It’s about time … with more money, we can do more.”\n\nHoman is confident the money will be spent by the end of Trump’s term, but couldn’t predict how long it will take for the administration to hit 1 million annual removals. He is already working with ICE to assess how many new agents the agency can hire over the next three months, and how quickly the administration can bring on new detention beds.\n\nThe Trump administration’s ability to expeditiously spend the billions it demanded is likely to prove decisive in its effort to increase deportations, a key campaign pledge and a line the administration will likely want to tout ahead of the midterms.\n\nWith the new money, the Trump administration will focus on constructing more of the border wall and barriers, while beefing up technology that will allow agents to communicate with each other in cellular and radio dead zones, Homan said.\n\nThe administration will also move quickly to grow detention capacity, working with contractors to bring vacant prisons and facilities back online and build up soft-sided facilitieslike Florida did with “Alligator Alcatraz.”\n\nICE has been “on a constant chase, trying to move flights out as quickly as possible just to make room for the arrests they’re making — they’re averaging 1,500 to 2,000 a day,” Homan said. “Teams are coming home before the end of a shift because of lack of beds — not a lot, but it’s happened a few times. So the beds are going to get us more capability for detention. That’s the big thing.”\n\nThe administration has also been fielding contractor pitches on technology and other solutions to improve its targeting efforts — finding undocumented immigrants inside the country. Homan said the administration will also work with contractors to ramp up transportation and removal flights, while also potentially using them to fill jobs that don’t require a badge or a gun.\n\nJohn Sandweg, acting ICE director from 2013 to 2014, highlighted the difficulty of hiring that many people that fast for complicated jobs. Significantly expanding ICE’s footprint includes recruiting, vetting, onboarding and training thousands of new officers and will require building out the agency’s human resources department, training centers, office space and resources — from vehicles to weapons.\n\n“That is way harder than it sounds,” Sandweg said. “And this is a second term — they have three and a half years left.”\n\nPast presidents, including Joe Biden, have secured billions from Congress, only to learn that “shovel ready” projects are hard to come by. The Biden administrationrushed to get fundsout the door before Trump took office, and the current administration hastried to freezehundreds of billions of dollars in grants — only to bestymied by the courts.\n\nSandweg estimated deploying 10,000 new officers would take at least three years, and if the administration wants to get this done before Trump’s term ends, “you’re going to have to really push it to the limits in order to get them operational in this administration.”\n\nThat has him concerned that vetting standards could be lowered for speed, he said. The rapid build-up of Customs and Border Patrol under former President George W. Bush raised questions about that administration’s hiring standards at the time, which resulted inwidespread misconduct at the agencythat carried into the Obama administration.\n\nAnd as illegal border crossings decline, ICE must look within the country to reach its arrest quota — a goal of 3,000 daily apprehensions in recent weeks. But an increase in arrests in the months ahead doesn’t automatically result in more deportations, as it will take time for the administration to build out a “logistical pipeline all over the country,” said Ken Cuccinelli, who served as deputy secretary of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term.\n\n“It’s a whole lot of little contracts with state and local officials. It’s building more facilities. It’s reopening the ones they already have. And all you need is one choke point in the logistics — every convoy is as fast as the slowest ship,” Cuccinelli said. “You’ve got to have the planes, the vehicles, the manpower, the security, in all the right places.”\n\nThe domestic policy bill also includes over $1 billion for the immigration court system to hire more judges and staff, but it’s unclear how quickly the administration can build out the courts, and whether it can move at a rate that can keep up with an increased pace of ICE arrests — or if the effort will ultimately result in longer detention time.\n\nThe Trump administration’s efforts to work around the immigration courts have been met with legal challenges. And the case backlog is substantial: roughly 700 immigration judges are coping with a 3.5 million case pile-up.\n\nThe funding for immigration judges is “important as well, because the system is backlogged,” said Michael Hough, director of federal relations at NumbersUSA, a group that works to reduce both legal and illegal immigration. “Just because you detain these people, especially people who have been here for a while, they need hearings — you’ve got to get them in front of an immigration judge.”\n\nWhile the White House celebrates the bill’s passage, political pressure is already growing for congressional Republicans to enact new policy. Immigration hawks say the money is crucial, but the party also has to look to legislation that will make permanent changes to the immigration system — such as reviving talks around border security and asylum law from the party’s legislation fromlast year, known as H.R.2.\n\n“There are other legislative changes that Republicans campaigned on, and that we’re going to continue to be looking to them to move things forward and not just sit on their hands now that they’ve passed the Big Beautiful Bill Act,” said a person close to the Trump administration, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “No, this is a budget reconciliation bill … it’s infused a ton of money into this effort, but there’s still some policy changes that the administration has talked about and wants to pursue.”",

    "News_title":"‘Put His Name on Everything’: Why the Social Security Admin Shared Trump Propaganda",
    "News_text":"Throughout President Donald Trump’s second term, he’s used every means possible to promote himself and prop up his agenda in unprecedented ways — even as he pulls apart the government brick by brick.\n\nNow, it’s happening at the embattled Social Security Administration, which manages America’s core safety-net program. On Thursday, after Republicans passed Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — legislation that will slash taxes for the rich, rob millions of poor people of their health insurance, and turbocharge the president’s militarized deportations — the Social Security Administration sent out an email to an untold number of Americans claiming the bill “reaffirms President Trump’s promise to protect Social Security” while offering a range of misinformation about what the new law does.\n\nFor one thing, the Big Beautiful Bill does notprotectSocial Security. It will actually “hasten Social Security insolvency by a year,”accordingto Kathleen Romig, the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. This is one of several claims in the Social Security Administration email that Romig flagged as “highly misleading” in a thread on Bluesky.\n\nHowever, the bizarre email is just one small part of asprawling, government-wide projectthat is already costing American taxpayers well upwards of a billion dollars, as Trump officials prioritize the mass distribution of MAGA propaganda in ways that would likely make many veterans of Trump’s first term blush.\n\nAccording to a current administration official and another Trump adviser, various offices at different federal departments and agencies spend inordinate amounts of time finding ways to sell even small developments as massive, earth-shaking Trump accomplishments. “Put his name on everything,” is how the administration official characterized the ongoing trend across the federal government, the national Republican Party, and elsewhere.\n\nThe other Trump adviser, who has spoken to the president about this topic, tellsRolling Stonethat Trump and his appointees’ drive to do this — at the Social Security Administration and beyond — was influenced by the propaganda success that Trump saw during his first administration, when he demanded his name be printed on the Covid-19 stimulus checks sent out at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLess than six months into his second term, we’ve already seen the Trump administration pour $200 million into ads,at the president’s request, thanking him for his immigration crackdown; spend up to$45 millionon a military parade that took place on Trump’s birthday; and fly B-2 Bombers and other fighter jets over the White Houseduring the signing ceremonyfor the Big Beautiful Bill on Friday.\n\nThe move to turn the Social Security Administration into yet another Trump propaganda organ comes as the agency’s services degrade — thanks in large part to Trump and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), whichgutted its workforce, moved to shutter local offices, and sought to implement majortechnical changesdue to baseless concerns about fraud. As a result of DOGE’s changes, Social Security recipients in need of assistance may now find themselves stuck on the phone for more than three hours, if their calls aren’tdisconnected without warning.\n\nAmid that ongoing crisis, the Trump administration now has the Social Security Administration touting the Big Beautiful Bill as benefiting seniors in ways it does not.\n\n“The bill ensures that nearly 90 percent of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits, providing meaningful and immediate relief to seniors who have spent a lifetime contributing to our nation’s economy,” the email claimed. It added, “The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”\n\nTrumpput itmore succinctly during the White House signing ceremony for the legislation, claiming that the bill achieves “no tax on Social Security for our great seniors.”\n\nRomig, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank,wrotein a thread on Bluesky that the Big Beautiful Bill “did NOT repeal taxation of Social Security” benefits, and that its so-called “senior deduction” has literally “nothing to do with getting Social Security.”\n\n“Most beneficiaries are NOT affected by the bill,” she added. “For ex: Beneficiaries who don’t pay taxes on Social Security now (and most don’t!). Beneficiaries under age 65. Beneficiaries w\/ incomes above the bill’s phase-out.”\n\n“Donald Trump has created a massive customer service crisis at Social Security,” Alex Lawson, executive director at the liberal advocacy group Social Security Works, tellsRolling Stone. Now, “instead of addressing the very real crisis people are facing,” he says, the agency is “sending a piece of political propaganda filled with lies.”\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nMusk's Grok Chatbot Fantasized About Breaking Into X User's Home and Raping Him\n\nLinda Yaccarino Times X Resignation Perfectly After Grok's 'Mechahitler' Meltdown\n\nTrump Is Cutting Tens of Thousands of Veterans Affairs Workers\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nThe Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nAnatomy of a Fake News Scandal\n\nThe Radical Crusade of Mike Pence\n\nSign up forRollingStone's Newsletter.

    "News_text":"The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country ofSouth Sudan, following alegal sagathat had kept the deportees stuck in amilitary base in Djiboutifor weeks.\n\nAssistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.\n\nThe deportations to South Sudan — a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit — mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nNone of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.\n\nThe high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world — irrespective of their human rights record — to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.\n\n\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"\n\nThe deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.\n\n\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.\n\nThe men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, theSupreme Court on Thursdayclarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.\n\nThat April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.\n\nWhen he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, whereU.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.\n\nBut theSupreme Court last monthsuspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.\n\nHours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.\n\nMoss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.\n\nLater on Friday, Murphy denied the advocates' request, saying the Supreme Court orders were \"binding.\"\n\nDeath toll rises as desperate search for Texas flash flood survivors continues\n\nSabrina Carpenter on the biggest misperceptions about her\n\nHow Lady Liberty became a beacon for immigrants",

    "News_title":"Shiite pilgrims commemorate Ashoura in Karbala, Iraq, under tight security",
    "News_text":"BAGHDAD (AP) — Tens of thousands of pilgrims are in the Iraqi city of Karbala forAshoura, the holy day on which Shiite Muslims commemorate the martyrdom ofImam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nTheannual pilgrimageis one of the largest religious events in the Shiite world.\n\nAshoura holds deep religious and historical significance for Shiites, marking the 680 A.D. Battle of Karbala, in which Imam Hussein, along with his family and companions, was killed after he refused to pledge allegiance to the Umayyad caliphate, cementing the schism between Sunni and Shiite Islam. For Shiites, the commemoration has come to symbolize resistance against tyranny and injustice.\n\nThe event Sunday comes in the wake of unprecedented regional escalation, following the recentIsrael-Iranwar, as well as other dramatic developments including the fall of Syria's former PresidentBashar Assad— an ally of Iran — in December and the killing ofHassan Nasrallah, longtime leader of the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah.\n\nThe streets of Karbala were carpeted in red and lined with stations offering food and water to the pilgrims, who came from Iraq’s provinces and from abroad, including large numbers from Iran, the Gulf states, Lebanon and Pakistan.\n\nBlack-clad men, women, and children gathered around the shrines of Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas, performing traditional mourning rituals including chest-beating, elegies, and lamentations.\n\nAlthough the occasion is religious in nature, some participants chanted against Israel and the United States as they processed through the streets of Karbala. Many banners also expressed support for the “Axis of Resistance,” a cluster of Iran-backed factions and governments.\n\nIraqi Interior Minister Abdul Amir al-Shammari arrived in Karbala on Saturday and held an extended meeting at the operations command headquarters with senior security and intelligence officials and representatives of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of mostly Shiite militias that are officially under the command of the Iraqi military.\n\nThe interior ministry said in a statement that the session focused on tightening control over the city’s entrances and intensifying intelligence and field operations to safeguard the massive crowds.\n\nMembers of theIslamic Stateand other groups following an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam, who consider Shiites to be apostates, have carried out attacks during Ashoura gatherings in Iraq and other countries in the region over the years.\n\n“The resistance’s weapons are what protected Iraq, and they will not be surrendered—no matter how great the internal or external pressure,” Abu Ali al-Askari, a spokesperson for Iraq’s powerful Kataib Hezbollah militia, which is closely aligned with Iran, said during the commemorations.\n\nHis remarks came amid renewed national debate over the future role of armed factions in Iraq, especially in the wake of the recent regional escalations.\n\nThe government of northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region said in a statement Saturday that a drone had crashed overnight in an open area near the regional capital of Irbil and that “some groups affiliated with the Popular Mobilization Forces carry out such attacks with the aim of creating chaos.”\n\nIt called for the federal government in Baghdad “to put an end to these acts of sabotage and take the necessary legal action against their perpetrators.”\n\nThe Iraqi army responded in a statement that the accusation against the PMF was “unacceptable” and “issued in the absence of evidence” and said it could “provide hostile parties with justifications to undermine Iraq’s stability.”",

    "News_title":"Iran’s supreme leader appears in public for first time since start of conflict with Israel",
    "News_text":"Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei attended a religious gathering on Saturday, according to Iranian state media outlet Press TV, the first time he has appeared in public in several weeks.\n\nKhamenei had not made a public appearance since his country was plunged into conflict on June 13, when Israel unilaterally bombed Iranian military and nuclear sites. The US later joined in, bombing three key Iranian nuclear sites before US President Donald Trump declared a ceasefire.\n\nIn video posted by Press TV on X, Khamenei waves to a crowd of black-clad worshippers marking the eve of Ashura, when Shia Muslims commemorate and mourn the death of the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson Husayn ibn Ali. The crowd greeted the cleric in turn with cheers and chants.\n\nKhamenei, the longest-ruling leader in the Middle East, reportedly spent the 12-day conflict with Israel and the US hiding in a bunker with little access to outside communications. During the conflict, both Israeli politicians and Trump openly discussed overthrowing Khamenei’s government and deposing him by force.\n\nAfter reportedlyrejecting an Israeli planto kill Khamenei, Trump stated in late June that the cleric was an“easy target.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out targeting Khamenei either, saying that his death would “not … escalate the conflict,” but rather “end” it.\n\nIn a recorded statement posted from an undisclosed location days after the ceasefire began, Khamenei was defiant, declaring victory over both Israel and the US. Khamenei took time to respond directly to US President Donald Trump, who had called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” shortly before ordering US airstrikes.\n\n“This (conflict) is not about our nuclear program,” Khamenei said. “This is about Iran surrendering … in his statement, (Trump) revealed the truth, he showed his hand. The Americans have had a fundamental issue with Islamic Iran since our revolution.”\n\n“And it will never happen,” Khamenei said of Trump’s demand.\n\nNonetheless, the conflict with Israel and the US has likely bruised Khamenei’s reputation in Iran,analysts told CNN in June. Israel’s initial strikes were unprecedented in their depth, killing some of the country’s top military leadership on day one.\n\n“The Islamic Republic had one social contract with society, which is that it deprived them of all freedoms … in return for providing security,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. “Now, that image has been shattered in the eyes of the Iranian people.”\n\nKhamenei’s new public appearance comes a day after Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US won’t allow Iran to restart its nuclear program.\n\n“If they did start, there’d be a problem. We wouldn’t allow that to happen,” Trump said Friday.\n\nTrump said he would discuss the previous strikes with Netanyahu, who is due to visit Washington on Monday.\n\nThe comments echo remarks made earlier on Friday by Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, who said his country must maintain “aerial superiority” over Iran to ensure it cannot rebuild its nuclear or missile production programs.\n\nTrump reiterated his claim that Iran wants to meet with the US for talks, a statement Iranian officials have repeatedly denied.\n\nThe Trump administrationhas discussed possibly helping Iranaccess as much as $30 billion to build a nuclear program for civilian energy production, easing sanctions, and freeing up billions of dollars in restricted Iranian funds – all part of an intensifying attempt to bring Tehran back to the negotiating table, four sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Rutte praises Trump in a NYT interview while warning of Russia's rising threat to NATO",
    "News_text":"Europe must dramatically ramp up its defenses against a resurgent Russia, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview with the New York Times published on July 5, crediting U.S. President Donald Trump for driving the alliance to unprecedented levels of commitment.\n\nRutte, who assumed his role late last year after 14 years as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, has been navigating NATO through a period marked by Russia's expansionist ambitions and questions about the reliability of the United States as an ally.\n\n\"Russia is reconstituting itself at a pace and a speed which is unparalleled in recent history,\" hetold the outlet, adding that \"...they are now producing three times as much ammunition in three months as the whole of NATO is doing in a year. This is unsustainable, but the Russians are working together with the North Koreans, with the Chinese and Iranians, the mullahs, in fighting this unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine.\"\n\nHe emphasized the interconnectedness of security across different regions, noting that a secure Arctic is vital due to increased Chinese and Russian activity, and a secure Atlantic is \"crucial\" for the U.S. \"If the Arctic, if the Atlantic Ocean, if Europe is not secure, the U.S. has a big problem,\" Rutte said, arguing that Russia is ultimately aiming to attack the U.S.\n\nThe Secretary General strongly dismissed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's comments that NATO's new defense spending targets would \"bankrupt\" members.\n\n\"I know Sergey Lavrov very well. He has been foreign minister of Russia since the birth of Jesus Christ, and I’ve never taken him seriously. When you talk about fake news, listen to Sergey Lavrov,\" Rutte told the NYT. He believes Lavrov's comments are \"clearly evidence that the deterrence is working.\"\n\nRutte acknowledged concerns about the defense industrial output across the alliance, adding that, \"we simply lack the defense industrial base to produce the weapons we need to make sure that we can deter the Russians or the North Koreans or whoever to attack us.\" He underscored the importance of not just financial investment, but also having sufficient personnel and industrial capacity to effectively utilize weaponry.\n\nOn the subject of Ukraine, Rutte confirmed that European allies have significantly increased their financial commitment. \"The Europeans have now cobbled together $35 billion in military aid this year to deliver to Ukraine, which is more than last year,\" he said. He viewed this as a logical and fair shift, with the U.S. expecting Europeans to \"take more of the burden when it comes to the concrete support to Ukraine.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the complex discussions surrounding peace talks, Rutte recognized President Donald Trump's role in initiating dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"He is the one who broke the deadlock with Putin. When he became president in January, he started these discussions with Putin, and he was the only one who was able to do this. This had to happen. A direct dialogue between the American president and the president of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nHowever, Rutte admitted that subsequent peace talks in Istanbul involved Russia sending a less serious delegation, leading to the conclusion that \"we are not there yet, and that means that in the meantime you have to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight.\"\n\nDespite some perceived divergences in approach between NATO and the U.S. regarding peace talks, Rutte insisted on the American administration's commitment to the conflict's importance.\n\n\"The American administration completely takes the view and shares it with the Europeans that this war in Ukraine is crucial for the defense of NATO territory going forward and that we have to make sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to stop the Russians from taking more territory, and that when it comes to a cease-fire or, even better, a peace deal, that Ukraine with some help will be able to prevent Putin from ever attacking Ukraine again in the future.\"\n\nRead also:Trump says Putin ‘wants to keep killing people,’ signals US may send Patriots to Ukraine\n\nWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent, locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

Our strategy wasn't just about business; it was about becoming an integral part of Detroit's remarkable revitalization story.\n\nThis vision materialized through transformative partnerships. Our move downtown and collaboration with the Ilitch organization led to the creation of313 Presentsand the Pistons calling Little Caesars Arena home, revolutionizing Detroit's entertainment landscape. Our partnership with Henry Ford Health and Michigan State is transforming New Center, establishing a world-class medical campus that serves as both a health care destination and a catalyst for neighborhood renewal.\n\nNow, we're writing the next chapter with the return of the WNBA to Detroit. This team will bring a new generation of sports stars to the city and inspire girls to dream big about the possibilities of success on and off the court.\n\nAnd it’s about more than adding another major professional team to the Detroit sports landscape. We fully intend to build a team that competes for championships on a consistent basis and our ambitions extend far beyond the court. We aim to utilize the team’s platform to create economic opportunities, support women’s and youth sports and provide Detroit’s youth access to top-tier sports facilities to further their growth and development.\n\nMore:Detroit wins WNBA expansion bid. Why did Detroit Shock leave and why is league expanding?\n\nBringing 22 more home games and other related events to the Detroit sports calendar each year will spur economic activity at bars, restaurants, and hotels around downtown Detroit. Additionally, our plans for the team’s state-of-the-art headquarters include a youth development academy to promote youth sports and address the lack of access and equity among youth sports facilities in Detroit. Along with WNBA team facilities, the plans include indoor basketball and volleyball courts for community use, as well as outdoor fields for youth soccer, flag football and other activities.\n\nThe realization of this bold vision will only be possible through collaboration to ensure that the sum is greater than the collection of its parts. We've assembled an extraordinary ownership group that reflects Detroit's diversity and excellence — from Sheila Ford Hamp and Mary Barra's pioneering leadership to the hometown pride of Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff. The sports lineage and additional support from respected figures like Ethan and Gretchen Davidson and Denise Ilitch along with all our other accomplished investors further strengthens our commitment to Detroit's future.\n\nUnder Tom's leadership, we've united an unprecedented coalition of leaders who have been instrumental in Detroit's transformation. When presenting this WNBA opportunity, the response was overwhelmingly positive — a testament to Detroit's unified spirit. With backing from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Mayor Mike Duggan and numerous community partners, we've demonstrated that Detroit moves forward as one.\n\nDetroit and Michigan's foundation for success is unparalleled. We're home to global automotive giants like GM and Ford, innovative companies like Rocket, prestigious institutions including the University of Michigan, Michigan State, Wayne State and University of Detroit Mercy, world-class health care through Henry Ford Health and a sports culture that's second to none.\n\nThis ecosystem creates a powerful platform for growth across technology, research, finance, health care, sports, entertainment and culture. We're not just building businesses; we're creating a future where our talented youth see Detroit as a place of unlimited opportunity and innovation. Each success and partnership strengthens our collective ability to achieve even more, proving that when Detroit comes together, there are no limits to what we can accomplish.\n\nMore:Detroit shouldn't be triggered by Sophie Cunningham's naïve opinion about WNBA expansion\n\nThat’s been Tom’s vision and commitment from the very beginning.\n\nThe WNBA initiative isn't just about bringing another professional sports team to Detroit — it's about continuing our city's momentum and showing the world what Detroit does best: turning bold visions into reality through unity, determination and pride in our community.\n\nArn Tellem is the vice chairman of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor atfreep.com\/letters,and we may publish it online and in print.\n\nLike what you're reading?

    "News_text":"Amazonannounced earlier this monththat it would invest $10 billion to build a data center campus in Richmond County, creating at least 500 new high-tech jobs in cloud computing and artificial intelligence innovation. It is the largest capital investment in the history of North Carolina, with the potential to transform a now-quiet rural community that once thrived off of industrialization. But is the area prepared to handle the impact?\n\nRichmond County is 70 miles east of Charlotte. Hamlet and Rockingham, the two biggest municipalities, used to be textile towns. Hamlet was a railroad hub. The region experienced an economic downturn after the 1970s when the textile industry left. It’s mostly been in a slump since.\n\nIt’s a rural region primarily known for its speedways and its wilderness. Now, the pines and back roads could be the backdrop for a brighter future.\n\nThe mayor of Rockingham, John Hutchinson, is an amateur historian. His office is full of pieces of the county’s past—daguerreotypes, art and baseball caps. He is still digesting the significance of the deal.\n\n“I don’t think the real impact of what it means has reached people. People are still trying to grasp what it really is,” Hutchinson said.\n\nHutchinson is convinced the deal happened because of the faith residents put in their community. To him, it proved Rockingham could do big things.The numbers in the investment dealsignal unprecedented growth and influence. It’s a $10 billion dollar investment in a county whose entire property tax base is currently $3.5 billion. Richmond County gave Amazon an 20-year incentive grant, which effectively functions as a tax rebate. In order for Amazon to keep the incentive, it must deliver at least $1 billion of cumulative capital investment to the county.\n\nJust for perspective, even the lowest possible number for the deal would amount to nearly one-third of all the county’s relevant property tax.\n\nMartie Butler, the county’s economic developer, said the county was expecting the tax dynamics to change quickly. Now the county is developing a strategic plan to help officials grow the right way and reach ground rules. The plan is still up in the air.\n\nHutchinson later showed me the town in the searing heat. The most prominent sight in the town is Great Falls Mill. It’s a ruin of a mill on the side of the exit road, a visual token of lost prosperity. Now that prosperity may be returning, in part because local leaders never gave up on the possibility that it would.\n\nState senators and former mayors continued to fight for the town after the mills left. They brought in the Duke Energy plant and the I-73\/74 corridor, which kept the town as a transportation hub. The county kept building, preparing for developments way larger than what they needed. It paid off. The data center will be right across the street from the energy plant. Hutchinson said this was carefully planned.\n\nHutchinson isn’t worried about the town growing too much. He has total faith in the leaders of the county and town. Hutchinson said towns can lose their identity with growth, but he believes it’s possible for Rockingham to grow and not lose its character.\n\n“You know, somebody wins the $100 million dollar lottery, and they get excited and blow it all and have nothing to show for it. We’ve watched things like that and said, ‘That’s not going to be us,’” Hutchinson said.\n\nThe drive to Hamlet from Rockingham is bridged with construction, high grass, and religious billboards that warn of the sins of man.\n\nEnergy Way Industrial Park lies on the outskirts of both cities. It’s 800 acres of low pines. In the past, the land was used to harvest lumber and pine straw. It has a steady stream of water siphoned from the Pee Dee River. There is both a source and separate location for recycling AI waste water.\n\nMingo Crowley sits in his Chevrolet in front of the lot. He was the consultant for the land. He gave tours of the lot to potential buyers, often cleaning up the lot in his spare time. He looks at the trees.\n\n“This is a diamond mine, there’s a lot of diamonds in that sand. You see pine trees. I see diamonds,” Crowley said.\n\nCrowley was born in Hamlet. Most residents above the age of 50 have an anecdote about the rail days. Crowley said there used to be movie theaters and nice restaurants, but those types of businesses haven’t been around since the 80s.\n\n“There’s a lot of things that we had then that we don’t have now. We went backwards 20 years,” Crowley said.\n\nCrowley, who is a vice president of an engineering consulting firm, has seen dozens of lots like this, but he is most excited about this one. His children can have the lives he had. The property tax will benefit education and the quality of life will improve.\n\nCrowley said the Amazon data campus is bigger than the railroad first coming to town. He thinks the deal has the potential to change the county for the better.\n\n“We didn’t know where the bottom was. We are there. Now, we are coming out,” Crowley said.\n\nSo what’s the downside? Most local officials expressed absolute belief in Amazon, but many recent big business announcements, such asan Apple campus and VinFast production center, have been slow to get off the ground. There are also always risks of an area growing too fast. There could be planning and zoning issues, and shortages of housing and resources. Less than 10,000 people live in each city now — are they prepared for a potential influx of new residents?\n\nThere are also ethical problems about how Amazon treats their workers.Crowley said he couldn’t attest to Amazon’s past, but he said there was a difference between working at a fulfillment center and working at a data center. There are questions about the possibilities that AI data centershave a high cancer riskfor workers.\n\n“When it comes down to it, if you don’t want cancer, don’t work there. Cancer is all around us to begin with,” Crowley said.\n\nProsperity matters in this region. To Crowley, this facility is the best possible scenario for an area so big. Data centers are the way of the future, Crowley said, and they run cleaner than power plants. He said the deal is like winning the lottery. The only thing that he says could go wrong is the urge to dictate the process.\n\n“Politics and control. That’s the biggest problem. Whatever party you’re affiliated with, it gets back to control,” Crowley said. “When control means more than your life, citizens, your life, your country, you lose.”\n\nDespite the unbridled optimism of local leaders, it’s hard to say what the future holds. I think of the symbols of Richmond County. There is Great Falls Mill. To some, it represents the fallen industry of Rockingham, a visual defeat. But past the failures of vine and brick, there is the same river that brought prosperity before. The people never gave up. The rivers flow and the machines hum. Richmond County will move forward again.\n\nAlex Nettles is a rising senior at Elon University and an intern for the North Carolina Opinion team.",

    "News_text":"Paris’ssocialist mayor has come under firefor approving funding for a “guinea pig cuddling” project for children in a wave of “wasteful” subsidies.\n\nAnne Hidalgo’s town hallearmarked €2,500 (£2,158) for the association Pat à Pas (Paw by Step), which says its mission is to promote wellbeing, fulfilment and self-sufficiency through contact with nature, notably “animal-assisted therapy”.\n\nThe project includes hundreds of hours of sessions with children to feed, brush and cuddle guinea pigs. Such animals are “allies and facilitators” who accept humans for “who they are, not who they should be”, it says on its website.\n\nChildren are invited to reconnect with the rhythms of nature to “rediscover our senses, the essence and meaning of our presence to ourselves, to others, to the world and to our future”.\n\nThe organisation also conducts workshops in retirement homes and with the homeless.\n\nBut the Citizens’ Transparency, an association “fighting against corruption and the misuse of public funds” in France, said it was appalled by the “oftenopaque and ideological funding choicesthat are detrimental to the real needs of Parisians”.\n\nThe town hall is set to spend €300 million (£259 million) on such initiatives in 2025.\n\nIn a thread posted on X, the association drew up a list of “daft” projects approved in the latest municipal council meeting last week, which included €5,000 for “a radio [station] that only broadcasts in Eritrea”.\n\n“While this independent radio is not without merit, should Parisians be the ones paying for a radio they cannot listen to?” the transparency group asked.\n\nA further €1,500 was set aside for “gymnastics classes tailored to LGBTQI+ seniors” so that these “remain affordable”.\n\nIt also took issue with handing €2,000 to Action Justice Climate, a “social environmentalist” organisation, which the association accused of being hard-Left group for which “ecology is the least of their concerns”.\n\n“Their real fight is anti-fascism, pension reform, and promoting the New Popular Front [a Left-wing parliamentary alliance]. Parisians, this is what you’re funding,” the group in an online post.\n\n“These subsidies highlight aglaring lack of rigour and transparencyin the management of public funds.\n\n“While Parisians face unprecedented economic pressures, elected officials must be held accountable for these choices.”\n\nThe post generated lots of reactions online. Among them, Bruno Tertrais, the head of the Foundation for Strategic Research, an influential international security and defence think tank, wrote: “[This] or 100 days of meals for a homeless person, but it’s up to you.”\n\nOthers suggested there was a more productive and satisfying way of spending the money on the cuddly pets.\n\n“In Ecuador, it’s much cheaper! I took a course to learn how to cook them, and it cost me the equivalent of €8 [£6.91]. Plus, it was a delight; I discovered that the pleasure of the taste buds is true therapy,” wrote one user on X.\n\nBut some users were more supportive of the scheme.\n\n“Everyone knows that animals help you feel calmer, more confident, etc. This project is far from daft,” one wrote.\n\nThe association launched a petition, which has more than 700 signatures so far, calling for “an immediate review of the criteria for awarding subsidies, giving priority to projects of proven public interest”.\n\nThe petition demands “full transparency on the use of funds, with public and verifiable reports”, as well as “an end to subsidies for ideological projects that contradict the principle of public service neutrality or have no measurable impact on citizens”.\n\n“Public fundsmust serve all Parisians, not militant political agendas.”\n\nParis’ town hall last week approved €11.5 billion in spending, including €1.75 billion in investment.\n\nDuring heated debates, Ms Hidalgo blasted the government for imposing €275 million in extra levies in a bid to reduce the state deficit.\n\nBut the Right-wing opposition responded that this was a fig leaf for the mayor’s “catastrophic” management, which it said would see the capital’s debt “explode” to hit a cumulative total of €9.3 billion in 2025.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Opinion - The New York Times wants your private ChatGPT history — even the parts you’ve deleted",
    "News_text":"Millions of Americans share private details with ChatGPT. Some ask medicalquestionsor share painfulrelationship problems. Others even use ChatGPT as a makeshifttherapist, sharing their deepest mental health struggles.\n\nUsers trust ChatGPT with these confessions because OpenAIpromised themthat the company would permanently delete their data upon request.\n\nBut last week, in a Manhattan courtroom, a federal judge ruled that OpenAI must preserve nearly every exchange its users have ever had with ChatGPT — even conversations the users had deleted.\n\nAs it stands now, billions of user chats will be preserved as evidence in The New York Times’scopyright lawsuitagainst OpenAI.\n\nSoon, lawyers for the Times will start combing through private ChatGPT conversations, shattering the privacy expectations of over 70 million ChatGPT users who never imagined their deleted conversations could be retained for a corporate lawsuit.\n\nIn January,The New York Times demanded— and a federal magistrate judgegranted— an order forcing OpenAI to preserve “all output log data that would otherwise be deleted” while the litigation was pending. In other words, thanks to the Times, ChatGPT was ordered to keep all user data indefinitely — even conversations that users specifically deleted. Privacy within ChatGPT is no longer an option for all but a handful of enterprise users.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Sidney Steinupheldthis order. His reasoning? It was a “permissible inference” that some ChatGPT users were deleting their chats out of fear of being caught infringing the Times’s copyrights. Stein also said that the preservation order didn’t force OpenAI to violate its privacy policy, whichstatesthat chats may be preserved “to comply with legal obligations.”\n\nThis is more than a discovery dispute. It’s a mass privacy violation dressed up as routine litigation. And its implications are staggering.\n\nIf courts accept that any plaintiff can freeze millions of uninvolved users’ data, where does it end? Could Apple preserve every photo taken with an iPhone over one copyright lawsuit? Could Google save a log of every American’s searches over a single business dispute? The Times is opening Pandora’s box, threatening to normalize mass surveillance as another routine tool of litigation. And the chilling effects may be severe; when people realize their AI conversations can be exploited in lawsuits that they’re not part of, they’ll self-censor — or abandon these tools entirely.\n\nWorst of all, the people most affected by this decision — the users — were given no notice, no voice, and no chance to object. When one user tried to intervene and stop this order, the magistrate judgedismissedhim as not “timely,” apparently expecting 70 million Americans to refresh court dockets daily and maintain litigation calendars like full-time paralegals.\n\nAnd last Thursday, Stein heard only from advocates for OpenAI and the Times, not from advocates for ordinary people who use ChatGPT. Affected users should have been allowed to intervene before their privacy became collateral damage.\n\nThe justification for the unprecedented preservation order was paper-thin. The Times argued that people who delete their ChatGPT conversations are more likely to have committed copyright infringement. And asStein put itin the hearing, it’s simple “logic” that “[i]f you think you’re doing something wrong, you’re going to want that to be deleted.”\n\nThis fundamentally misapprehends how people use generative AI. The idea that users are systematically stealing the Times’s intellectual property through ChatGPT, then cleverly covering their tracks, ignores the thousand legitimate reasons people delete chats. Users share intimate details about their lives with ChatGPT; of course they clear their conversations.\n\nThis precedent is terrifying. Now, Americans’ private data could be frozen when a corporate plaintiff simply claims — without proof — that Americans’ deleted content might add marginal value to their case. Today it’s ChatGPT. Tomorrow it could be your cleared browser history or your location data. All they need to do is argue that Americans who delete things must have something to hide.\n\nWe hope the Times will back away from its stunning position. This is the newspaper thatwon a Pulitzerfor exposing domestic wiretapping in the Bush era. The paper that built its brand in part by exposing mass surveillance. Yet here it is, demanding the biggest surveillance database in recorded history — a database that the National Security Agency could only dream of — all to win a copyright case. Now, in the next step of this litigation, the Times’s lawyers will start sifting through users’ private chats — all without users’ knowledge or consent.\n\nTo be clear, the question of whether OpenAI infringed the Times’s copyrights is for the courts to decide. But the resolution of that dispute should not cost 70 million Americans their privacy. What the Times calls “evidence,” millions of Americans call “secrets.”\n\nMaybe you have asked ChatGPT how to handle crippling debt. Maybe you have confessed why you can’t sleep at night. Maybe you’ve typed thoughts you’ve never said out loud. Delete should mean delete. The New York Times knows better — it just doesn’t care.\n\nJay Edelson has been recognized by Forbes as one of America’s top 200 lawyers and by Fortune as one of the most creative people in business.

    "News_title":"Texas lawmakers failed to pass a bill to improve local disaster warning systems this year",
    "News_text":"For the last three days, state Rep.Wes Virdellhas been out with first responders in Kerr County as they searched for victims and survivors from the devastating floods that swept through Central Texas early Friday morning.\n\n“All the focus right now is let’s save all the lives we can,” Virdell, who was still on the scene in Kerrville, told The Texas Tribune on Sunday.\n\nVirdell’s closeup view of the havoc wreaked onhis districthas made a lasting impression, he said, and left him reconsidering a vote he made just a few months ago against a bill that would have established a statewide plan to improve Texas’ disaster response, including better alert systems, along with a grant program for counties to buy new emergency communication equipment and build new infrastructure like radio towers.\n\n“I can tell you in hindsight, watching what it takes to deal with a disaster like this, my vote would probably be different now,” said Virdell, a freshman GOP lawmaker from Brady.\n\nThe measure,House Bill 13, would have created a new government council to establish the emergency response plan and administer the grant program, both of which would have been aimed at facilitating better communication between first responders. The bill also called for the plan to include “the use of outdoor warning sirens,” like those used in tornado-prone Texas counties, and develop new “emergency alert systems.”\n\nAuthored by Rep.Ken King, R-Canadian, the legislation was inspired by last year’sdevastating wildfiresin the Panhandle, where more than 1 million acres burned — including part of King’s property — and three people died. The bill failed in the Texas Senate, promptingnewfound questionsabout whether lawmakers should have done more to help rural, cash-strapped counties stave off the deadly effects of future natural disasters.\n\nAs of Monday morning, at least 90 people had died in the floods. Of those, 75 were in Kerr County, many of them camping or attending a private summer camp along the Guadalupe River.\n\nVirdell, a Hill Country native who lives about 100 miles away, made his way to Kerrville early Friday after seeing news that rains raised the Guadalupe more than two feet, swamping its banks in Hunt and other river communities that host thousands of holiday vacationers.\n\nHe stressed an alarm system may not have helped much in this instance because the floodwaters came so quickly. Between 2 and 7 a.m., the Guadalupe River in Kerrville rose from 1 to more than 34 feet in height,according to a flood gauge in the area.\n\n“I don't think there was enough evidence to even suspect something like this was going to happen,” he said. ”I think even if you had a warning system there, this came in so fast and early in the morning it's very unlikely the warning system would have had much effect.”\n\nVirdell said he doesn’t recall the specifics of the bill or why he opposed it, though he guessed ”it had to do with how much funding” was tied to the measure.\n\nEven if it had passed, it would not have gone into effect until Sept. 1, after the Hill Country flooding.\n\nThe bill’sinitial $500 million costdrew heavy criticism from fellow Republicans including state Rep.Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington.\n\n“This shouldn't be about anything other than the fact that it's a half a billion dollars,” Tinderholt, a hardline conservative and budget hawk, said during the April 1 House floor debate. “This is probably one of the most simple votes we should be able to take today. It's that this interoperability council is going to spend money to try and get these departments to be able to talk together.”\n\nSteven Aranyi, a spokesperson for Lt. Gov.Dan Patrick, noted that lawmakers — including the Texas Senate, which Patrick oversees — made several “unprecedented” investments in disaster response during this year’s legislative session, totaling $547 million. That included:\n\n$257 million for disaster response aircraft,\n\n$135 million for regional operation facilities,\n\n$90 million to provide ambulances to rural counties,\n\n$65 million for emergency response drone technology.\n\nThe flaw with HB 13, Aranyi said, was that it proposed rolling out the local grant money over an estimated timeline of up to 10 years.\n\n“By the time any system was developed, it would be outdated due to advances in technology,” Aranyi said. “The grants in the bill were limited to planning purposes only; they did not support disaster response.”\n\nAs the disaster quickly unfolded in Kerr County, located in the heart of an area known for flash floods, much has been made of the fact that the county lacked a siren system that counties in other parts of Texas have to alert residents of tornadoes. Such a system has been considered before in Kerr County, but quickly dismissed because the high cost would fall alone on local taxpayers.\n\nA flash flood watch was issued by the National Weather Service by Thursday afternoon for the region. Then, in the middle of the night, at 1:14 a.m. Friday, a flash food warning was issued as possibly “catastrophic,” for Bandera and Kerr Counties, according to the NWS. Those alerts would have automatically triggered Wireless Emergency Alerts on enabled mobile devices,the weather service said.\n\nBut because the alerts went out when most residents and visitors were asleep, coupled with the fact that many of those children attending summer camp as well as their counselors were without cell phones, the alerts likely went unheeded by many.\n\nResidents who were up before daylight on Friday 4 reported rain misting by 3 a.m. but nothing out of the ordinary. That changed quickly by 5 a.m. Friday when flooding was detected on roadways in Kerr County.\n\nThe flooding reached its peak at around 6:45 a.m. in Kerrville, hours after warnings were first issued, according to the local flood gauge.\n\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly told reporters on Saturday local residents have rejected the idea of a siren system due to its expense when it had been suggested before.\n\n“The public reeled at the cost,”Kelly said.\n\nAt a news conference on Sunday, Gov.Greg Abbottleft the door open to legislation aimed at improving emergency warning systems, but stopped short of saying he would put it on the agenda for lawmakers to consider during the special session he has scheduled to begin July 21.\n\n“It's going to be something that will be looked at,” Abbott said. “The reality also is this, and that is, what's needed in that river basin at that location could be far different than what is needed in some other river basin across the state.”\n\nFor now, Virdell said his focus and that of officials in Kerr County is on locating more victims and helping residents. He said the collaboration between local responders and those others coming in from around the state has been “amazing.”\n\nTalk of warning systems and how to improve communications will eventually happen, Virdell said, adding that, right now, the focus needs to be on the immediate community.\n\n“That’s the No. 1 priority for now,” he said.\n\nShape the future of Texas at the 15th annualTexas Tribune Festival, happening Nov. 13–15 in downtown Austin!

    "News_title":"Ex-Treasury secretary pans Congress for passing Trump’s ‘shameful’ megabill he says will hurt economy",
    "News_text":"Donald Trumpgot his wish of signingthe “big, beautiful bill”into lawon July 4,but a top economist is pouring cold water on his celebrations.\n\nLarry Summers, the formerObamaTreasury chief and center-left economic guru, unleashed scathing criticism of the law on Sunday, claiming it was going to harm American economic growthby slashing the social safety netin the most unprecedented manner in decades.\n\n“The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over 10 years, 100,000 people. That is 2,000 days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend,” Summers told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos onThis Week.\n\n“In my 70 years, I’ve never been as embarrassed for my country on July 4th,” he added.\n\n“These higher interest rates, these cutbacks in subsidies to electricity, these reductions in the availability of housing, the fact that hospitals are going to have to take care of these people and pass on the costs to everybody else, and that's going to mean more inflation, more risk that the Fed has to raise interest rates and run the risk of recession, more stagflation, that's the risk facing every middle-class family in our country because of this bill.\n\n“And for what? A million dollars over 10 years to the top tenth of a percent of our population? Is that the highest priority use of federal money right now? I don't think so. This is a shameful act by our Congress and by our president that is going to set our country back,” Summers continued.\n\nHe also rejected out of hand projections from Trump’s White House Council of Economic Advisers, who claimed that economic growth resulting from the tax cuts and other measures in the bill would balance out the bill’s deficit spending. This proved to be a headache for conservatives who fought to make deeper spending cuts in the legislation, but were denied.\n\n“It is, respectfully, nonsense. None of us can forecast what's going to happen to economic growth,” said Summers. “There is no economist anywhere, without a strong political agenda, who is saying that this bill is a positive for the economy. And the overwhelming view is that it is probably going to make the economy worse.”\n\nSummers’s criticism will likely be written off by the administration as coming from a former Obama appointee, but even nonpartisan forecasters continue to fret that any growth of the U.S. economy resulting from tax cuts will likely be offset by the Trump administration’s tariff policies, which are set to go back into effect this Wednesday. A 90-day pause on the president’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs is due to end, and the president is set to send letters to numerous U.S. trade partners informing them of the new tariff rates.\n\nNegotiations with the EU and various countries are ongoing, but officials have given no indication that another pause is on the table. Markets slid sharply upon the last announcement that the president would be sharply raising tariffs.\n\nSummers is one of many economists who has called the president’s tariff strategy naive.\n\n“The question is mostly how much damage is going to be done,” he said of Trump’s tariffs in April, during a Bloomberg interview, adding that the reciprocal tariffs plan was “bizarre”.\n\nAndy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, also trashed Trump’s megabill on Sunday during an interview on CNN’sState of the Union.\n\nThe governor of a state with many rural areas, Beshear was a vocal opponent of the bill’s provisions to cut Medicaid and SNAP benefits via the imposition of work requirements, which nonpartisan analysts project will cause millions to leave the programs due to issues with paperwork, government red tape or confusion about reporting requirements.\n\nOn Sunday, Beshear delivered vicious criticism of Republicans in Congress who supported the legislation, accusing them of believing “that poor people are stupid” as the GOP attempts to deny that the bill represents a cut to Medicaid. Republican lawmakers, defending the bill’s new work requirements, have repeatedly echoed the same depiction of a Medicaid recipient at risk of losing eligibility under the new law: a young, male twenty-something living unemployed in a basement collecting government benefits, a cartoonish stereotype Democrats say simply doesn’t exist in real life.\n\n“You can lie all you want about what's in this bill. But the numbers are the numbers,” said Beshear on Sunday. “These work requirements aren’t really about getting people back to work. They are about increasing the paperwork on everybody.”",

    "News_text":"Socialist mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani appears to defend al Qaeda fiendAnwar al-Awlaki— and blame America for turning the prostitution-loving cleric into a terrorist — in newlysurfaced tweets.\n\nAl-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, became a prominent imam at mosques in San Diego and Virginia, eventually interacting with three of the heinous Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers there, US officials have said.\n\nHe was put under surveillance by the FBI after 9\/11 — a probe that uncovered among other things the fact that the conservative family-values-preaching Muslim cleric was frequenting prostitutes at hotels.\n\nAl-Awlaki moved to Yemen in 2004 — where he joined al Qaeda and hatched numerous international terrorist plots while preaching jihad in videos and on CDs.\n\nThe cleric was considered so dangerous that then-President Barack Obama approvedthe drone strike that killed him in 2011— an unprecedented assassination of an American citizen who had not been charged with a crime.\n\n“He directed the failed attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009. He directed the failed attempt to blow up US cargo planes in 2010,” Obama said at the time.\n\n“And he repeatedly called on individuals in the United States and around the globe to kill innocent men, women and children to advance a murderous agenda.”\n\nBut Mamdani, in a series of tweets in 2015, bizarrely criticized the FBI’s surveillance of al-Awlaki — and claimed the G-Men actually pushed him into terrorism — after reading aNew York Times accountof the snooping, whichrevealed the cleric’s hooker fetish.\n\n“Why no proper interrogation of what it means for FBI to have conducted extensive surv. into Awlaki’s private life?” wrote Mamdani, then 23.\n\n“How could #Awlaki have ever trusted@FBI to not release surveillance esp. if he continued to critique [the] state? Why no further discussion of how #Awlaki’s knowledge of surv. eventually led him to #alqaeda? Or what that says about [the] efficacy of surv?” Mamdani said.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.Subscribe here!\n\nThe comments have enraged 9\/11 victims’ families and US anti-terror officials.\n\n“To blame the United States for al-Awlaki is like blaming the Jews for Hitler,” seethed retired Long Island Rep.

Jim McCaffrey — whose brother-in-law,FDNY Battalion 7Chief Orio Palmer, rushed into the World Trade Center’s south tower to try to help people before the building collapsed on him and hundreds of others during the hijacked-plane strike — called Mamdani’s comments “very offensive to 9\/11 victims and their families.\n\n“It’s offensive to all New Yorkers and all Americans,” he said.\n\n“It’s an absolutely ridiculous assertion on Mamdani’s part.

It can not end well,” he said, referring to the lefty former mayor roundly criticized for his disastrous soft-on-crime policies.\n\nKing added, “Mamdani is making excuses and rationalizing al-Awlaki joining al Qaeda.\n\n“He’s trying to blame the US for him becoming a terrorist. It’s an absolute disgrace. It should disqualify Mamdani from being mayor of New York City.\n\n“Al-Awlaki was an evil man. It was a great victory to eliminate him from the face of the Earth,” King said.\n\nIntelligence sources claimed al-Awlaki’s disciples had been linked to about a quarter of the Islamists convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States from 2007 until his death.\n\nMamdani’s other slick, savvy and cheeky videos on social media helpedpower his victory over ex-Gov.

    "News_text":"AUSTIN (KXAN) — Search and rescue crews found Superman, a brown dog with floppy ears, alone and scared on top of a pile of debris, after devastating floods hit the Hill Country and other parts of Central Texas this weekend.\n\nAccording to Austin Pets Alive!, Superman’s person died in the flood. They described the dog as “fearful and aching after being swept away from his home.”\n\nThe rescue group said patient volunteers earned the dog’s trust and eventually were able to move him away from the area and to safety. A medical team evaluated him, before an Austin-area foster volunteer took him in.\n\n“His surviving family, now grieving and having lost everything, are doing everything they can to hold on to the last piece of their past that remains — Superman. But they can’t do it alone, so we quickly got to work to find their beloved pet a temporary foster until they get back on their feet,” the rescue wrote.\n\nSuperman is just one of hundreds animals impacted by the floods in Burnet, Kerr, Travis and Williamson counties now receiving services from Austin rescue groups.\n\nAustin Pets Alive! said it is working closely with Kerrville Pets Alive! and Kerr County Animal Services, in the wake of the devastating Guadalupe River flooding on Friday and ahead of more anticipated flooding Sunday evening.\n\nThe group said it has mobilized more search & rescue groups of 20 to 30 volunteers to scan riverbanks for lost or injured pets. It has also set up a “MASH-style” veterinary hospital, treating animals impacted by the floods.\n\nThe rescue posted a statement on social media from Dr. Ellen Jefferson, APA! President and CEO, about the devastation. It said, “So many people are searching for their pets that are the last connection they might have to a lost family member. Pets are so intertwined in this saga and it’s so important.”\n\nEarlier in the weekend, it put out an urgent plea for fosters after clearing out every existing animal at the shelter in Kerrville. APA! said the goal is to allow Kerrville volunteers and staff to focus on taking in animals closer to home.\n\nThe group also has staff and volunteers onsite in Williamson County, after floodwaters forced the the Georgetown Animal Shelter to evacuate all of its dogs and cats to the Williamson County Regional Animal Shelter. More than 100 animals arrived at the regional shelter, which is also requesting foster families and volunteers.\n\nWCRAS also asked anyone who finds a lost pet to consider keeping it overnight and posting about ithere, in order to try and reunify it with its family.\n\nIf you are missing a pet, have found a pet or need to report a pet left behind in Kerrville, APA! asks you to fill outthis form.\n\nKerrville Pets Alive!and theHill Country SPCAalso posted some photos of lost pets on social media.\n\nIn addition to fosters, each of these groups requested donations of money and supplies. APA! said it was actively accepting and redistributing supply donations at its Town Lake Animal Center (1156 W. Cesar Chavez St.) to other parts of Central Texas. APA! also asked specifically for donated airline kennels to help with a rescue flight, scheduled for July 9. They requested plastic transport kennels measuring 26″ to 36″ in length.\n\nMeanwhile,Austin Wildlife Rescue said it has receivedmore than 70 birds, squirrels, deer, rabbits, turtles and other wild animals — some injured in the flooding, others just waterlogged or confused.\n\n“While wildlife is adapted to handle life out in the wild, unprecedented or unusual weather impacts our native wildlife very much,” the rescue said in a release.\n\nFor more information on how to help these groups:\n\nAustin Pets Alive!\n\nKerrville Pets Alive!\n\nWilliamson County Regional Animal Shelter\n\nAustin Wildlife Rescue\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Among these emerging cannabinoids, THCA (Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) represents the latest wave of innovation, offering consumers a unique pathway to traditional cannabis effects through federally legal hemp products. As demand surges for high-quality, convenient consumption methods, disposable vape technology has become the delivery system of choice for this revolutionary compound.\n\nThis comprehensive guide provides everything consumers need to know about THCA disposable vapes—from the underlying science to practical considerations for safe, informed use. This surge in consumer curiosity and demand for high-purity products is the backdrop for Area 52's latest announcement, introducing premium THCA disposable vapes that set new industry standards for quality and transparency.\n\nWhat is THCA? Unpacking the Precursor to THC\n\nTetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA)is a naturally occurring, non-psychoactive cannabinoid found abundantly in raw and live cannabis plants. Unlike its famous counterpart Delta-9 THC, THCA exists in its acidic form and produces no intoxicating effects when consumed in its natural state. This compound serves as the precursor molecule that eventually transforms into the psychoactive THC through various processes.\n\nThe Power of Heat (Decarboxylation):The magic happens through a scientific process called decarboxylation. When THCA is exposed to heat—such as the temperature generated by a vape pen's heating element—it undergoes a molecular transformation. The heat removes a carboxyl group (COOH) from the THCA molecule, converting it into Delta-9 THC in real-time. This decarboxylation process is the fundamental mechanism that makes THCA vapes effective, allowing users to experience psychoactive effects on-demand.\n\nThe source material for legal THCA products derives from federally compliant hemp plants containing less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC by dry weight. This legal distinction enables manufacturers to produce potent THCA concentrates while maintaining compliance with federal hemp regulations established by the 2018 Farm Bill.\n\nDefining the THCA Disposable Vape Pen\n\nConvenience and Simplicitydefine the disposable vape format. These devices arrive as complete, all-in-one units featuring pre-filled cartridges, integrated batteries, and built-in heating coils. Most disposable THCA vapes require zero maintenance—no charging cables, no refilling procedures, and no component replacements. Some premium models offer rechargeable batteries that extend usage until the concentrate is fully consumed, maximizing value for consumers.\n\nUser Experiencecenters around hassle-free, discreet consumption. THCA disposable vapes fit comfortably in pockets or purses, produce minimal odor compared to traditional smoking methods, and offer precise dosing control. This combination makes them particularly appealing to both cannabis newcomers seeking simplicity and experienced users wanting portable convenience.\n\nWhat's Insidetypically includes high-concentration THCA distillate combined with carefully selected terpene profiles. Premium products often incorporate live resin or live rosin extracts, preserving the full spectrum of compounds found in fresh cannabis plants for enhanced effects and authentic flavor experiences.\n\nThe Science of the Experience: How THCA Vapes Affect the Body\n\nFrom Inhalation to Effect:The user journey begins when the device's heating element vaporizes the THCA concentrate. This vapor contains both unconverted THCA and freshly decarboxylated Delta-9 THC. Upon inhalation, these compounds rapidly absorb through lung tissue into the bloodstream, typically producing noticeable effects within 2-5 minutes. This fast onset allows users to titrate their dosage effectively, taking additional puffs as needed.\n\nThe Entourage Effect\n\nTerpenes—aromatic compounds naturally found in cannabis and many other plants—play crucial roles beyond flavor enhancement. These molecules work synergistically with cannabinoids through what researchers call the \"entourage effect.\" Different terpene profiles can influence whether users experience energizing, relaxing, or balanced effects. Common terpenes like myrcene promote sedation, while limonene and pinene tend to enhance alertness and focus.\n\nUnderstanding Concentrates: Live Resin vs. Live Rosin vs. Liquid Diamonds\n\nLive Resinextracts come from fresh-frozen cannabis plants, preserving volatile terpenes and minor cannabinoids often lost during traditional drying and curing processes. This extraction method maintains robust flavor profiles and comprehensive cannabinoid spectrums.\n\nLive Rosinrepresents solventless extraction using only heat and pressure to separate concentrates from plant material. This method appeals to consumers seeking the purest possible products without residual solvents.\n\nLiquid Diamondsfeature THCA crystals suspended in high-terpene extract sauce, creating potent concentrates with exceptional flavor complexity. These premium products typically command higher prices but deliver superior experiences for discerning consumers.\n\nNavigating the Effects: What to Expect from a THCA Vape\n\nPsychoactive Experience:Users must understand that vaping THCA produces psychoactive effects essentially identical to traditional Delta-9 THC cannabis. The decarboxylation process during vaping converts THCA into active THC, resulting in the characteristic cannabis \"high\" including altered perception, euphoria, relaxation, or stimulation depending on the strain and individual tolerance.\n\nStrain-Specific Effectsvary significantly based on the source material's genetics and terpene composition:\n\nIndica strainstypically associate with relaxing, calming, and sedative effects. These varieties often contain higher concentrations of myrcene and other relaxing terpenes, making them popular choices for evening use, stress relief, and sleep enhancement.\n\nSativa strainsgenerally provide uplifting, energizing, and creativity-enhancing effects. Rich in stimulating terpenes like limonene and pinene, these varieties suit daytime use, social activities, and creative pursuits.\n\nHybrid strainsblend indica and sativa genetics, offering balanced effects that combine relaxation with mental clarity. These versatile options work well for various occasions and user preferences.\n\nPotential Benefits:Emerging research suggests cannabinoids may offer anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and analgesic properties. However, consumers should consult healthcare professionals before using cannabis products for medical purposes and recognize that FDA has not evaluated these statements.\n\nA Comparative Look: THCA vs. Other Cannabinoids\n\nTHCA Vapes vs. Delta-9 THC Vapes\n\nThe primary distinction lies in legal sourcing rather than effects. THCA vapes derive from federally legal hemp, while traditional Delta-9 THC vapes come from marijuana regulated at state levels. Once vaporized, both products deliver essentially identical experiences since THCA converts to Delta-9 THC during consumption. The conversion process means users experience the same potency and effect profiles.\n\nTHCA Vapes vs. Delta-8 THC Vapes\n\nDelta-8 THCoffers a distinctly different experience characterized by milder, clearer effects compared to Delta-9 THC. Users often describe Delta-8 as providing relaxation and euphoria without the anxiety or paranoia sometimes associated with stronger THC variants. THCA vapes, converting to Delta-9 THC, typically produce more potent, traditional cannabis effects.\n\nTHCA Vapes vs. CBD Vapes\n\nThe fundamental difference centers on intended outcomes.CBD vapesdeliver non-psychoactive wellness benefits without intoxication, appealing to users seeking pain relief, anxiety reduction, or general wellness support. THCA vapes specifically target consumers wanting psychoactive effects and the traditional cannabis experience through legal hemp-derived products.\n\nEssential Consumer Guide: Safety, Legality, and Responsible Use\n\nThe Gold Standard: Why Third-Party Lab Testing is Non-Negotiable\n\nCertificates of Analysis (COAs)represent the cornerstone of product safety and quality assurance. Reputable manufacturers submit every batch to independent laboratories testing for cannabinoid potency, pesticide residues, heavy metals, microbials, and residual solvents. These comprehensive reports verify that products contain advertised cannabinoid levels while confirming absence of harmful contaminants.\n\nConsumers should always verify COA availability before purchasing and ensure testing was performed by accredited laboratories using validated testing methods. This transparency demonstrates manufacturer commitment to consumer safety and product quality—a standard Area 52 maintains across all product lines.\n\nThe Legal Landscape of THCA\n\nThe2018 Farm Billfederally legalized hemp and its derivatives containing less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC by dry weight, creating the legal framework enabling THCA product sales. However, state laws vary significantly, and some jurisdictions have specifically restricted or banned THCA products despite federal legality.\n\nStates with THCA restrictions include:Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Laws continue evolving rapidly, so consumers must verify current regulations in their specific locations before purchasing or possessing THCA products.\n\nTHCA and Drug Testing: An Important Consideration\n\nDrug test implicationscannot be overstated. Since vaporized THCA converts to Delta-9 THC and metabolizes identically to traditional cannabis, using these products will very likely result in positive drug tests for THC metabolites. Standard workplace drug screens, legal proceedings, and athletic competitions typically test for these metabolites, making positive results virtually certain with regular THCA vape use.\n\nDosage and Responsible Use\n\nNew usersshould start with minimal doses—typically one small puff—and wait 15-20 minutes to assess effects before consuming more. THCA vapes can be potent, and overconsumption may result in uncomfortable experiences including anxiety, paranoia, or excessive sedation.\n\nProper storagemaintains product integrity and safety. Store devices upright in cool, dark locations away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Avoid leaving vapes in hot cars or freezing conditions that might damage batteries or alter concentrate consistency.\n\nThe Future of Hemp-Derived Products and Area 52's Contribution\n\nTHCA disposable vapes represent a significant evolution in hemp-derived cannabinoid consumption, offering consumers convenient access to potent, federally legal products that deliver traditional cannabis experiences. These innovative devices combine cutting-edge extraction technology with user-friendly delivery systems, democratizing access to high-quality cannabis effects.\n\nKey takeaways for informed consumers include prioritizing products with comprehensive third-party lab testing, understanding local legal restrictions, recognizing drug testing implications, and practicing responsible dosing protocols. The rapid market expansion demands consumer education and manufacturer transparency to ensure safe, satisfying experiences.\n\nArea 52's entry into the THCA disposable market directly addresses growing consumer demand for reliable, high-quality, and rigorously tested products. By maintaining industry-leading standards for purity, potency, and transparency, Area 52 positions itself as a trusted partner in the evolving landscape of hemp-derived cannabinoid innovation. As the market continues expanding, companies prioritizing consumer education, product quality, and regulatory compliance will define the industry's future trajectory.\n\nCONTACT: Area 52 ufo@area52.com",

    "News_title":"Merz ‘uses hard-Right playbook to woo voters’ in Pride row",
    "News_text":"Friedrich Merzis caving in to the hard-Right on social issues, Germany’s first transgender MP has claimed, after the German chancellor appeared to draw a comparison between gay people and circus clowns.\n\nMr Merzthis week waded into a bitter row about whether the rainbow flag should be flown over the Bundestag, the German parliament building, during Berlin’s Pride parade.\n\n“The Bundestag is not a circus tent,” Mr Merz said, as he backed his centre-Right Christian Democrats (CDU) party’s decision to break with recent tradition and not raise the flag on July 26.\n\n“On all other days, the German flag and the European flag are raised on the German Bundestag, and no other. This decision is the right one,” he added, in an interview on the German politics talk show Maischberger.\n\nMr Merz’s comments outraged LGBT supporters in Germany and led to accusations that he was adopting the rhetoric of the hard-RightAlternative for Germany(AfD) party, which also opposes flying the rainbow flag on official buildings and has now claimed a major political victory.\n\nAlice Weidel, the AfD leader, who is lesbian, has argued that the rainbow flag is no longer a neutral symbol, and is part of a Left-wing political movement promoting pro-transgender ideology.\n\nBut Nyke Slawik, who was elected as Germany’s first openly trans MP along with fellow candidate Tessa Ganserer in the 2021 elections, pointed out that attacks on LGBT people in Germany were on the rise, and that Mr Merz risked emboldening extremists.\n\nThe centre-Left Green party MP said: “With these defamatory statements, Friedrich Merz is adding fuel to the fire by equating the rainbow flag – and thus the fight for LGBTIQ human rights – with a circus.\n\n“The worst thing is that the threat level and number of attacks on queer people has increased massively, with Pride parades being attacked by Nazis and often needing police protection.”\n\nMs Slawik, 31, who represents the west German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, also called on Mr Merz to apologise to gay people in Germany for the “circus-tent” jibe.\n\n“The AfD demanded in a Bundestag motion that the rainbow flag should no longer be flown on government buildings. It’s shocking that the president of the Bundestag and now the chancellor are giving in to this AfD demand,” she said.\n\nMr Merz, who was sworn in as chancellor in May, is facing intense political pressure from the anti-migrant AfD, which secured an unprecedented second place in February’s federal elections. The result marked the first time that a hard-Right party had become the de facto opposition in Germany since the Second World War.\n\nDespite having a gay leader, the party is highly sceptical of the Pride movement in Germany, which it considers a Left-wing construct that is eroding traditional ideas about gender in German society.\n\nIn a recent motion, the party said the rainbow flag should not be flown over official government buildings, such as the Bundestag, because it violates the principle of state neutrality.\n\nWhen Mr Merz endorsed that position this week, Bernd Baumann, an AfD MP, said: “The fact that Merz supports this shows that he is continuing to learn from us.”\n\nSome German analysts have rejected this argument, pointing out that Mr Merz is an old-school social conservative who has never been particularly enthusiastic about gay rights.\n\nConstantin Wurthmann, a political scientist at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research, said: “This is not a new position for Merz. As early as 2020, he caused irritation when he stated in an interview that a person’s homosexuality did not matter to him – as long as the law was respected and ‘children were not involved’.\n\n“He is certainly not a frontrunner when it comes to LGBTIQ rights.”\n\nIt is also not the first time Mr Merz, who for years was sidelined in his party for his populist streak, has flirted with hard-Right rhetoric. During one recent parliamentary debate on migration, the chancellor claimed that asylum seekers were gang-raping Germans on a “daily basis”.\n\nHis use of circus imagery to describe gay people is particularly controversial in Germany because of the country’s Nazi past, when gays were forced to wear pink triangles in concentration camps.\n\nSandra Stein, an MP whose constituency includes Mr Merz’s home-town of Brilon in west Germany, said: “His remark must be condemned in the strongest possible terms: it turns queer people and their legitimate concerns into an object of ridicule at a time when attacks on them, particularly from the Right end of the spectrum, have massively risen.”\n\nMaik Brückner, the gay rights spokesman for the German Left party, said: “It’s true that the Bundestag is not a circus tent and yet we have a clown for a chancellor.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Despite representing only4% of the world’s population, the United States accounts forover half of science Nobel Prizesawarded since 2000, hostsseven of The Times Higher Education Top 10 science universities, and incubates firms such asAlphabet (Google),MetaandPfizerthat turn federally funded discoveries into billion-dollar markets.\n\nThe domestic STEM talent pool alone cannot sustain this research output. The U.S. is reliant on a steady and strong influx of foreign scientists – a brain gain. In 2021, foreign-born people constituted43% of doctorate-level scientists and engineers in the U.S. They make up a significant share of America’s elite researchers: Since 2000, 37 of the 104 U.S. Nobel laureates in the hard sciences,more than a third, were born outside the country.\n\nChina, the U.S.’s largest competitor in science, technology, engineering and math endeavors, has a population that is4.1 times larger than that of the U.S.and so has a larger pool of homegrown talent. Each year, three times asmany Chinese citizens (77,000)are awarded STEM Ph.D.s asAmerican citizens (23,000).\n\nTo remain preeminent, the U.S. will need to keep attracting exceptional foreign graduate students, budding entrepreneurs and established scientific leaders.\n\nThis scientific brain gain is being threatened by the Trump administration, which is usingfederalresearch funding,scholarshipsandfellowshipsas leverage against universities, freezing billions of dollars in grants and contracts to force compliance with its ideological agenda. Its ad hoc approach has been described by higher education leaders as “unprecedented and deeply disturbing,” and a Reagan-appointed judge ruled that 400 National Institutes of Health grants be reinstated because their terminations were “bereft of reasoning, virtually in their entirety.”\n\nExperts cautionthat these moves not only risk immediateharm to scientific progressand academic freedom but also erode the public’s trust in science and education, with long-term implications for the nation’s prosperity and security.\n\nCiting national security concerns, the White House has also targeted visas for Harvard University’s international students and instructed embassies worldwide tohalt visa interviewsfor all international students, citing national security andalleged institutional misconduct. Against a backdrop ofcourt injunctionsand legal appeals, the government continues its heightened “national-security” vetting, so thousands of international scholars remain in limbo.\n\nThese measures, combined withtravel bans, intensified scrutiny and revocations of existing visas, havedisrupted research collaborationsand threaten the nation’s continued status as aglobal leader in science and innovation.\n\nThe U.S. research brain gain starts with the281,000 foreign STEM graduate studentsand 38,000 foreign STEM postdoctoral scholars who annually come to the U.S. I am one of them. After earning my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in South Africa, I left in 1986 to avoid the apartheid‑era military service, completed my chemistry doctorate and postdoc in the U.S., and joined the United States’ brain gain. It’s an opportunity today’s visa climate might have denied me.\n\nIncentives for the best and brightest foreign science students to come to the U.S. are diminishing at the same timeits competitors are increasing their effortsto attract the strongest STEM researchers. For instance, theUniversity of Hong Kongis courting stranded Harvard students with dedicated scholarships, housing and credit-transfer help. A French university program,Safe Place for Science, drew so many American job applicants thatit had to shut the portal early. And a Portuguese institute reportsa tenfold surgein inquiries from U.S.-based junior faculty.\n\nImmigrantsimport new ways of thinkingto their research labs. They come from other cultures and have learned their science in different educational systems, which place different emphases on rote learning, historical understanding and interdisciplinary research. They often bring an alternative perspective that a homogeneous scientific community cannot match.\n\nImmigrants also help move discoveries from the lab to the marketplace.Foreign-born inventors file patentsat a higher per‑capita rate than their domestic peers and are80% more likely to launch a company. Such firms createroughly 50% more jobsthan enterprises founded by native-born entrepreneurs and pay wages that are, on average, one percentage point higher.\n\nThe economic stakes are high. Growth models suggest that scientific advances now account fora majority of productivity gainsin high‑income countries.\n\nL. Rafael Reif, the former president of MIT, calledinternational talent the “oxygen” of U.S. innovation; restricting visas chokes that supply. Ongoing cuts and uncertainties in federal funding and visa policy now jeopardize America’s scientific leadership and with it the nation’s long‑term economic growth.\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "News_title":"Trump Administration’s funding freeze impacts these Massachusetts school programs",
    "News_text":"BOSTON (WWLP) – The Trump Administration is withholding $108 million in K-12 funding for Massachusetts schools, which could lead to layoffs, program cancellations, and disruptions in learning, according to a news release from Governor Healey’s office.\n\nThe Healey-Driscoll Administration said the Trump Administration for its unprecedented withholding of billions of dollars in education funding across the country, including $108 million for Massachusetts schools. These funds were expected to be received on July 1 for school districts that rely on support for a range of programming, including summer and after-school programs, behavioral and mental health supports, bullying prevention and intervention, reducing chronic absenteeism, buying materials and supplies for classrooms, and more.\n\nSome education grants in limbo were used for ‘leftwing agenda,’ Trump administration says\n\n“Every day that goes by without this education funding hurts children, educators, communities and our economy,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Without this funding, districts are going to be forced to lay off staff, delay or cancel programs and services, and disrupt learning. Our schools were promised this funding, and the Trump Administration needs to deliver it.”\n\nThe Healey-Driscoll Administration stated that the following federal education grants are “under review” to make sure they align with President Trump’s priorities:\n\nTitle I-C, which provides educational support for children ofmigratory agricultural workers and fishers\n\nTitle II-A, which supportssystems of support for excellent teaching and leading\n\nTitle III-A, which supportsEnglish learners\n\nTitle IV-A, which supportshigh-quality educational experiencesfor students\n\nTitle IV-B, which supports Out-of-school21st Century Community Learning Centers\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education also said that they are withholding funds for the Integrated English Language and Civics Education programs, as well as the Adult Basic Education Grants to States program.\n\n“I chaired a school committee, and I know what these federal dollars mean for our kids locally – high-quality educators, adult education that helps families succeed, and access to after school programs,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “The Trump Administration’s actions will impact every school district in our state and have far-reaching effects today and into the future.”\n\n“This is another action by the Trump Administration to create chaos and hurt our students. Donald Trump does not get to unilaterally decide which students and schools are deserving of federal support. Congress appropriated these funds, and they need to be issued to states,” said Education Secretary Dr. Patrick Tutwiler. “Intentionally withholding this funding is going to have detrimental impacts on every state and all communities, especially for some of our most vulnerable students.”\n\n“Withholding these funds will make our schools and communities weaker and puts our students’ success at risk,” said Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez. “Our teachers and schools cannot do their best work if the federal government removes promised funding.”\n\n“Withholding education funding directly harms young people, educators, and school districts across Massachusetts. President Trump and his administration are playing with students’ futures and educators’ livelihoods. The President must respect the separation of powers and Congress’s Constitutional authority to appropriate funding. I urge him to release these funds immediately—and I urge Congress to stop ceding their power to this President,” Senate President Karen E. Spilka (D-Ashland).\n\n“With the withholding of these critical federal funds, the Trump administration is once again playing politics at the expense of students and families. In particular, by delaying or denying funding to support students who are English learners, migrants, and immigrants, the President is doubling down on his attack on some of our most vulnerable populations who are already living in uncertainty and fear,” Dr. Mary Bourque, Executive Director, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents.\n\n“The Trump administration continues its attack on public education by withholding billions of dollars in congressionally approved funds earmarked for consequential student services. The more than $100 million being withheld from Massachusetts directly helps young people new to our country to learn English, supports effective instruction, funds literacy support, and provides after-school and summer opportunities for low-income students. Ignoring the law and inflicting cruelty have become routine features of the Trump administration, but we refuse to accept this and are committed to fighting for what our students deserve,” Max Page, President, and Deb McCarthy, Vice President, Massachusetts Teachers Association.\n\n“Schools, students, and families across the nation have – once again – been thrown into chaos by the White House. Deciding on a whim to halt already budgeted, federally mandated funding that supports our most vulnerable students just hours before it was set to be disbursed and days before summer sessions are set to begin for many is not only disruptive, it’s unjustifiably cruel. The fact that it’s being done the same week they’re passing tax cuts for the wealthiest and stripping services from the neediest makes this illegal impoundment all the more inhumane and unconscionable,” Jessica Tang, President, American Federation of Teachers, Massachusetts.\n\n“Withholding federal funds is a huge disservice that portends even more threats to the stability of school budgets. It is most comforting to know that the governor understands and, as always, has our backs, and shows the courage to speak truth to power,” Glenn Koocher, Executive Director, Massachusetts Association of School Committees.\n\n“The federal government needs to release the adult education funds lawfully allocated under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, including $10.9 million for Massachusetts. Adult education provides a pathway to economic self-sufficiency for adults and their families, and ultimately prosperity for the Commonwealth. The gutting of the American Dream begins with dismantling the education system by withholding funds, and it is not acceptable policy,” Roberta Soolman, Board President, Massachusetts Coalition for Adult Education.\n\n“The devastating withholding of afterschool and summer program funds from the federal government is unacceptable. Communities across Massachusetts know that these programs are keeping young people safe, inspiring them to learn and grow, and giving working families peace of mind,” Patrick Stanton, Executive Director, Massachusetts Afterschool Partnership.\n\n“Failing to release the Congressionally approved funding is an unprecedented action that will have an impact on the on nearly 1.4 million children and families across the country, including the more than 220,000 Boys & Girls Club kids attending 21st CCLC programs across 926 Club sites. States and community-based organizations have already committed these funds to carry out programming for students and families. Failure to release this funding will result in summer camp closures, staff layoffs and closures of Boys & Girls Clubs ahead of the 2025-2026 school year – forcing working families to make tough decisions to support their children. We urge the release of this funding to ensure the safety and academic success of our kids,” Jennifer Aldworth, Executive Director, Massachusetts Alliance of Boys & Girls Clubs.\n\nWWLP-22News, an NBC affiliate, began broadcasting in March 1953 to provide local news, network, syndicated, and local programming to western Massachusetts.

    "News_text":"[Source]\n\nCongress has approved a historic $170 billion immigration enforcement package that includes $45 billion to nearly double the nation’s capacity to detain immigrants, marking the largest expansion of the detention system in U.S. history.\n\nWhat we know:TheOne Big Beautiful Bill Actpassed Thursday provides $45 billion for immigrant detention centers over four years —exceedingwhat the government spent on detention during the Obama, Biden and first Trump administrations combined. The funding boost represents a 265% increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) current detention budget, making it over five times higher than the current $8.3 billion budget of the U.S. federal prison system. The broader $170 billion package includes $46.5 billion for border wall construction and new immigration fees, including a $100 minimum for asylum applications. President Donald Trump signed the legislation Friday.\n\nWhat authorities are saying:ICE officials say they plan to use the funds to roughly double detention capacity to 100,000 beds, up from 59,000 current detainees. “This bill will make our communities safer by making a historic investment in our border security,” Rep. Addison McDowell (R-N.C.) said Thursday morning on the House floor. Border czar Tom Homan toldNewsNationthat “Everybody we arrest, we need a bed, because they’re going to be in detention from several days to several months.” The funding will support hiring 10,000 new ICE agents, though former acting ICE director John Sandweg toldPoliticothis is “way harder than it sounds” and could take three years.\n\nBroader implications:The expansion comes as enforcement has shifted dramatically. ACBS analysisshows detentions of immigrants without criminal histories rose over 250% since May, with non-criminals now outnumbering those with convictions 2:1 in new arrests. Only 8% of all detainees have been convicted of violent crimes, with traffic violations being most common. Criticswarnthe rapid expansion could strain oversight, as DHS has already shuttered its internal detention monitoring office. At least 10 immigrants died in ICE custody during the first half of the year.\n\nTrending on NextShark:ICE detention funding now 5 times higher than federal prison system budget\n\nThe Trump administration has three-and-a-half years to implement the unprecedented expansion and reach its goal of 1 million annual deportations.\n\nThis story is part of The Rebel Yellow Newsletter — a bold weekly newsletter from the creators of NextShark, reclaiming our stories and celebrating Asian American voices.\n\nTrending on NextShark:Groundbreaking Chinese gene therapy restores hearing for inherited deafness\n\nSubscribe free to join the movement.

    "News_title":"Republican Chris Carr raises $1.25M more for 2026 Georgia governor bid",
    "News_text":"ATLANTA (AP) — GeorgiaAttorney General Chris Carrsaid Monday he raised another $1.25 million for his 2026 gubernatorial bid from Feb. 1 to June 30.\n\nThe Republican announced the fundraising totals to The Associated Press on Monday, although he hasn’t yet filed an official report with the state Ethics Commission. Those reports are due Tuesday.\n\nCarr raised $2.2 millionfrom November through mid-January, but couldn’t raise money while lawmakers were in session from mid-January until the end of March. He didn't immediately say how much he has spent of the nearly $3.5 million he has raised.\n\nCarr is the only major GOP candidate who has announced for the race in Georgia, which saw titanic battles for the governor’s chair between RepublicanBrian Kempand DemocratStacey Abramsin 2018 and 2022. Abrams lost both races, and no Democrat has won a governor’s race in Georgia since Roy Barnes in 1998. Republicans argue Georgia needs the stability of continued Republican control.\n\nDemocrats are meanwhile trying to prove their successes in other races were not a fluke. Former President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020 and U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff were elected to the Senate in runoffs in January 2021. In 2022, Warnock beat Republican Herschel Walker in a runoff to claim a full six-year term.\n\nCarr took theunprecedented step of announcinghis run for governor in November in part because he said he needed to get an early jump on fundraising. He could face Republican rivals with enough personal wealth to fund their own campaigns. Republican Lt. Gov.

    "News_title":"Biden's former doctor asks to delay testimony to House panel, citing patient privilege concerns",
    "News_text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Joe Biden’s physician has asked to delay his testimony before the House oversight committee this week, citing the need for an agreement that will respect doctor-patient confidentiality rules as part of the investigation into Biden's health in office.\n\nDr. Kevin O’Connor, who served as Biden’s physician at the White House, requested a delay until the end of July or early August “to reach an accommodation that will protect the very substantial privilege and confidentiality interests of Dr. O’Connor and former President Biden,” according to a letter from his lawyer sent to Rep. James Comer of Kentucky on Saturday. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the letter.\n\nA spokesperson for Oversight Republicans said the committee will follow the House’s deposition guidelines, which allow for witnesses to assert privilege on a question-by-question basis, with the committee chair ruling on each claim. But O'Connor is not allowed, in the committee's view, to delay or decline a congressional subpoena due to concerns over questions about potentially privileged information.\n\nThe back-and-forth is part of a broader struggle over the scope of the House Republican inquiry into Biden’s age and mental fitness, with serious implications for both politics and policy. Republicans have also claimed that some policies carried out by the White House “autopen” may be invalid if it is proven that Biden was mentally incapacitated for some part of his term.\n\nBiden has strongly denied claims that he was not in a right state of mind at any point while in office, calling the claims \"ridiculous and false.”\n\nThe House Oversight Committee first requested O’Connor testify before the committee last July, but the Biden White House blocked his testimony. Comer renewed his request in May and later subpoenaed the doctor in June.\n\nDavid Schertler, the attorney for O'Connor, in the letter said the committee is refusing to “accommodate to any degree Dr. O'Connor's objections” over protecting privilege. He said the committee's decision was “unprecedented” and “alarming” and warned that it threatened broader principles around medical privacy.\n\nScherlter said O’Connor could face “serious consequences\" for violating his obligations as a doctor, including losing his medical license.\n\nIn a June subpoena of O’Connor, Comer said that claims of physician-patient privilege under the American Medical Association’s code of ethics “lack merit” because that code is not part of federal law. He said the committee’s subpoena meets the AMA’s own requirement that physicians must share a patient’s medical information if “legally compelled to disclose the information” or “ordered to do so by legally constituted authority.”\n\nComer has promised that the committee will make all its findings public in a report after the inquiry has finished. He has subpoenaed O'Connor and Anthony Bernal, former chief of staff to former first lady Jill Biden. The committee last month heard voluntary testimony from Neera Tanden, former director of Biden's domestic policy counsel.\n\nThe committee has also requested the testimony of nearly a dozen former senior Biden aides, including former White House chiefs of staff Ron Klain and Jeff Zients; former senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn; former deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, former counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, former deputy chief of staff Annie Tomasini and a former assistant to the president, Ashley Williams.\n\nThe Trump White House has waived executive privilege, a principle that protects many communications between the president and staff from Congress and the courts, for almost 10 senior former Biden staffers. That move clears the way for those staffers to discuss their conversations with Biden while he was president.\n\nWhile the privilege can apply to former staffers, the decision of whether to waive it is decided by the sitting administration.",

    "News_title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Horrific Comments on the Texas Floods Are Just the Beginning",
    "News_text":"Sign up for the Slatestto get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn Friday morning, heavy rains began pounding Central Texas along the Guadalupe River, rapidly swelling the river basin—by nearly 30 feet in less than an hour—and spurring deadly flash floods. Dozens of children were reported missing fromthe grounds of Camp Mystic, a nearly century-old Christian girls’ summer camp, as floodwaters surged east along the river and ravaged the neighboring city of Kerrville, downing roads and power lines while residents attempted to flee. Federal and local authorities began carrying out rescue missions as morerain overran householdsin the towns of Burnet and Liberty Hill, extending the damage well into Saturday. By that evening, Gov. Greg Abbott had requested emergency federal aid for six different Texas counties, a declaration that President Donald Trump quickly honored. The floodwaters began receding Sunday morning—only to rise once again asless-severe rains poured into the already-devastated region.\n\nAs of this writing, flood warnings are still in place for various areas north of Kerrville, including Llano County, where the Llano River’s water levelsare currently rising. As of Monday afternoon, the official death toll from the weekendstands at 104, with a large majority of those fatalities having occurred in Kerr County—where at least 56 adults and 28 children have perished. That makes these floods some of thedeadliest in thecountry’smodern history, and there are likely more reported deaths to come, with dozens of Texans still missing andmore flooding forecastthroughout the week across the waterlogged towns.\n\nCentral Texas had been suffering fromdrought conditionsthis summer, yet the needed rains landed too suddenly, at too rapid a pace. The remote counties hardest hit are located in what’s known asFlash Flood Alley, but the sheerspeedat which the rains fell and the rivers swelled was horrific and unprecedented. A catastrophe of this scale and pace spurs urgent questions that seek impossibly quick answers. And, as is sadly typical these days, there are many waiting to provide only wrong answers, with the goal of inflaming political passions and redirecting a state’s, and country’s, mass grief. You could see this in a manufactured story that went viral this weekend and was even picked up by mainstream outlets: the rumored rescue of two missing girls who’d been clinging for life to a tree. This was an entirely made-up account boosted via Facebook,according to CNN’s Brian Stelter, and it served only to provide false hope to grieving parents. Even House Rep. Chip Roy, anotherwise-reliable conspiracist, took to social media toswat downthis feel-good hoax.\n\nThe bigger question, however, was that of preparation—how could Texans have shielded themselves from such hard-falling rains and rapidly rising waters? Many liberals werequick to point outthat the Trump administration’ssteep cutsto the government’s weather-monitoring andwarning systemslikely contributed to inaction and incapacity; elected officials in the harmed areas blamed the local National Weather Service outposts for not providing sufficient forecasts. (As is typical of him, Trump referred to those federal services as a “Biden setup.”)\n\nBut, at least in this case, none of those explanations holds water. Yes, thereare staffing shortagesat the NWS stations in San Angelo and in San Antonio, and those exist in part because of DOGE’s governmentwide cuts. Still, by all accounts, the meteorologists in place at neighborhood NWS offices did the best they could, having issued consistent warnings of increasingly intense “downpours” in the days leading up to stormfall. By Thursday evening, as Wired’s Molly Taft reported, the NWShad even dispatched a flood watch. Itistrue that the agency did not predict the exact amount and extent to which the rains would fall and overflow the banks of the Guadalupe River—not least because what unfolded was the worst-case scenario. And that unprecedented severity did not become apparent to forecasters until the early-morning hours of Friday, when most residents were asleep. These remote Central Texas towns may not havewidespread cellphone reception, making it difficult for residents to receive timely alerts anyway. Those who might have turned to the internet instead would not have seen anything until around 5 a.m., when the Facebook pages for the Kerrville Police Department and the Kerr County governmentfinally reshared the scarier NWS warnings.\n\nSuch important details are granular in nature, and it doesn’t help when some of Texas’ neighbors lob their own conspiracy theories. In Georgia, MAGA congressional candidate Kandiss Taylorposted multiple tweets on Xreferring to “fake weather” and “fake flooding,” doubling down against “raging liberals” and “brainwashed zombies” when encountering backlash. “It’s cloud seeding, geoengineering, & manipulation,” Taylor tweeted. “If fake weather causes real tragedy, that’s murder. Pray. Prepare. Question the narrative.”\n\nSince it apparently wasn’t enough for one Georgia Republican to raise such alarming conspiracy theories, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene joined in on the action, continuing her proud tradition of blamingJewish space lasersand claiming that a certain “they” can “control the weather” in response to historic natural disasters. This time, she’s pushing legislation piggybacking off Taylor’s nods to cloud seeding and geoengineering (the basis of her prior lies about how “they can control the weather”),tweeting on Saturdaythat she had introduced a bill that “prohibits the injection, release, or dispersion of chemicals or substances into the atmosphere for the express purpose of altering weather, temperature, climate, or sunlight intensity.” But cloud seeding and geoengineering experimentsare severely limitedin scope andunable to power anything even resemblingthis weekend’s rains. So now we’ve ended up in a place where even alongtime climate denierlike Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is being forced to push back against Greene and Taylor’s disinformation, admitting that there’s “zero evidence” such “weather modification” could have caused this.\n\nYes, climate change is key to this tragedy. Weather analysts have observed that the flood conditions were exacerbated by adeadly, unlikely combination: northward-bound remnants of the tropical cyclone that flooded southeastern Mexico late last month, which traveled above thelong-steaming, constantly warming watersof the Gulf of Mexico (whose alarming temperaturesprovided fuellast year for ghastly HurricanesHeleneandMilton). A jet stream then carried all this moisture to an especially flood-prone region of Texas, with riverbeds and arid soil and hillsides. This was theworstpossible manifestation of this climate change–induced setup.\n\nThough the NWS isn’t thoroughly sabotaged, our federal systems are woefully unprepared for the summer. By the end of this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration willstop transmitting information from military satellitesthat have been deployed and used historically to measure the paths of extreme-weather disasters like hurricanes. So it’s only a matter of time before the Trump administration cutsdofail us. But we won’t be ready to take on the future if we don’t get straight what’s going wrongnow. We may find out how bad things are sooner than later: Tropical Storm Chantal is currentlyflooding North Carolina with inches of rain, and the water is making its way up through the northeast.",

    "News_text":"KERR COUNTY, Texas (KXAN) – In the aftermath of deadly Hill Country flooding, Texas’ junior Republican U.S. Senator is defending the National Weather Service, as questions surface over the agency’s forecast timing, urgency and communication.\n\n“I think there have been some eager to point at the National Weather Service and say cuts there led to a lack of warning,” Sen. Ted Cruz said during a press event with Gov. Greg Abbott Monday in Kerr County, where dozens died after the Guadalupe River tumbled over its banks July 4. “I think that’s contradicted the facts.”\n\nAlso on Monday, U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged the Commerce Department to investigate NWS vacancies and whether they contributed to the death toll and affected the agency’s ability to coordinate with local emergency officials.\n\n“This is a national tragedy which people across the country are mourning,” Schumerwrote to Duane Townsend, the Commerce Department’s acting inspector general. “The American people deserve answers.”\n\nThe Trump administration made cuts to the federal workforce an early priority in the president’s second term this year, and those reductions extended to the NWS.\n\nKXAN has previouslyreported six vacancies in the NWS Austin\/San Antonio, according to its online staff roster and the NWS Employees Organization. Those include three meteorologists, two technology staff members and a science officer. The office has 26 employees when fully staffed.\n\nLIVE BLOG: Search, recovery efforts continue for 4th day after deadly floods hit central Texas\n\n“They had additional manpower,” the Cruz said. “In fact, they had three additional people working that night, anticipating that it was going to be a very dangerous weather situation.”\n\nThe NWS Austin\/San Antonio office issued a flash flood warning at 1:14 a.m. Friday for a portion of the county. At about 4 a.m., the river rose over 30 feet in less than two hours,according USGS data.\n\nWhile the NWS has not answered KXAN’s specific questions about its timeline and staffing, it has provided additional details about notifications leading up to those critical hours:\n\nThe National Water Center Flood Hazard Outlook issued on Thursday morning indicated an expansion of flash flood potential to include Kerrville and surrounding areas.\n\nA flood watch was issued by the NWS Austin\/San Antonio office at 1:18 p.m. on Thursday, in effect through Friday morning.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center issued three Mesoscale Precipitation Discussions for the excessive rainfall event as early as 6:10 p.m. Thursday indicating the potential for flash flooding.\n\nThe National Water Center Area Hydrologic Discussion #144 at 6:22 p.m. on Thursday messaged locally considerable flood wording for areas north and west of San Antonio, including Kerrville.\n\nOn Monday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson responded to KXAN’s inquiries, calling NWS operations surrounding the flood “successful.”\n\n“The NWS leveraged advanced tools like the Amber Alert software to send critical flood warnings directly to wireless devices, ensuring widespread awareness,” Jackson wrote in an email. “While we mourn the tragic lives lost in this disaster, the NWS’s early and frequent warnings saved countless others.”\n\nCritics have questioned the effectiveness of those specific warnings in rural and remote areas of Central Texas. Representing the administration on Saturday, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem visited the area along the Guadalupe River, calling the amount of rain in the flooding event “unprecedented,” broadly referencing the administration’s goal to “fix” aging technology within NOAA – the parent agency to the NWS.\n\n“I do carry your concerns back to the federal government and back to President Trump,” Noem said, acknowledging the need for upgraded technology so “families have as much warning as possible.”\n\nWhat the NWS put out was also information used by the state and its emergency management team – alerts, or warnings, about heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding, Abbott said in a Sunday press event.\n\n“A problem with that is that to most people in the area flash flooding would mean one thing, not what it turned out to be; because they deal with flash floods all the time,” Abbott said.\n\nAbbott: Special session may address warnings after deadly Texas floods\n\nAbbott said he discussed NWS alerts with Noem during her visit over the weekend. In the upcoming special session – starting in two weeks – the Texas Legislature would address the response to weather events like this deadly flood, he added.\n\nKXAN has reached out to Abbott’s office to see if he has been briefed on the NWS’ staffing and has further comment. At the Sunday press conference, KXAN asked the governor if he had any concerns about NWS vacancies affecting warnings ahead of the recent flood.\n\nAbbott said he knew “nothing about the staffing,” but did know the chronology of alerts from that office.\n\nOn Monday, Cruz said the local NWS office actually had three additional people working during the time leading up to the flood but also acknowledged the “limits” of a flash flood making earlier detection challenging.\n\n“Everyone would agree, in hindsight, if we could go back and do it again, we would evacuate particularly those in the most vulnerable areas, the young children, the cabins closest to the water,” Cruz said. “We would remove them and get them to higher ground. If we could go back and do it again, obviously, everyone would.”\n\nHe also warned against “partisan” finger-pointing at this stage, suggesting a broader public safety review after rescue and recovery has wrapped would eventually be needed to “make sure that critical roles are maintained.”\n\n“I think it is reasonable overtime to engage in a retrospective and say at every level what could have been done better, because all of us would want to prevent this horrific loss of life,” Cruz said. “But I think just immediately trying to use it for either side to attack political opponents… that’s cynical and not the right approach, particularly at a time when we’re dealing with a crisis.”\n\nIn an interview with NBC, Tom Fahy, legislative director for the NWS Employees Organization, defended the Weather Service’s forecasting alerts leading up to the flood, while also acknowledging staffing cuts have significantly whittled down manpower in offices across the country.\n\n“The staffing that we had in both San Angelo and San Antonio offices, we had adequate amount of staff to get out the alerts and warnings to the public,” Fahy said. “The flood warning was issued 12 hours in advance of the event.”\n\nPredicting the exact severity, and that a 30-foot wall of water would come down Guadalupe, isn’t possible for a forecast, he said.\n\nWhile the NWS has faced staffing shortages for years, the level of losses this year is far more pronounced and concerning, he said.\n\nAbout 600 people have left their NWS posts from the beginning of the Trump administration to April 30, a change with “dramatic impact,” said Fahy. That’s as many people as the NWS lost in the last 15 years to retirement and attrition, but the agency was able to hire and fill those vacancies immediately, unlike now, Fahy said.\n\nWhen Trump came into office, he instituted a federal hiring freeze through July 15 of this year. NWS can’t immediately refill its vacancies, but they have asked for special consideration to get that done, Fahy said.\n\n“We’re a tightly knit organization delivering outstanding results for the American public,” said Fahy. “This comes down to the math. It comes down to budget numbers, and we are short staffed.”\n\nDr. Venkataraman Lakshmi, professor of engineering at the University of Virginia and president of the hydrology section of the American Geophysical Union, also said forecasting the number of feet the Guadalupe would rise near Kerrville would have been nearly impossible.\n\n“Predicting rainfall is more difficult than predicting the stock market,” Lakshmi said. “It’s based on physical equations. It’s based on atmospheric dynamics. It’s a very complicated mathematical model.”\n\nLakshmi said he had no knowledge of the staffing vacancies at NWS, but, for the past 40 years, the NWS has led worldwide progress on weather forecasting. While the storm was predicted in advance, the location of the Kerr County tragedy was so close to the source of the water it left little reaction time.\n\n“As hydrologists, we are very concerned about lead time, but if you’re sitting at the source of the water, it’s very difficult,” he said. “There is, sadly, no answer to the fury of rainfall and the fact that this fell right at the most terrible place.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"China extends visa-free entry to more than 70 countries to draw tourists",
    "News_text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign tourists are trickling back to China after the country loosened its visa policy to unprecedented levels. Citizens from 74 countries can now enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, a big jump from previous regulations.\n\nThe government has been steadilyexpanding visa-free entryin a bid to boost tourism, the economy and its soft power. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 — almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.\n\n“This really helps people to travel because it is such a hassle to apply for a visa and go through the process,” Giorgi Shavadze, a Georgian living in Austria, said on a recent visit to the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.\n\nWhile most tourist sites are still packed with far more domestic tourists than foreigners, travel companies and tour guides are now bracing for a bigger influx in anticipation of summer holiday goers coming to China.\n\n“I’m practically overwhelmed with tours and struggling to keep up” says Gao Jun, a veteran English-speaking tour guide with over 20 years of experience. To meet growing demand, he launched a new business to train anyone interested in becoming an English-speaking tour guide. “I just can’t handle them all on my own” he said.\n\nAfterlifting tough COVID-19 restrictions, China reopened its borders to tourists in early 2023, but only 13.8 million people visited in that year, less than half the 31.9 million in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.\n\n30 days for many in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Mideast\n\nIn December 2023, China announcedvisa-free entry for citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. Almost all of Europe has been added since then. Travelers fromfive Latin American countries and Uzbekistanbecame eligible last month, followed by four in the Middle East. The total will grow to 75 on July 16 with the addition of Azerbaijan.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the countries have been granted visa-free entry on a one-year trial basis.\n\nFor Norwegian traveler Øystein Sporsheim, this means his family would no longer need to make two round-trip visits to the Chinese embassy in Oslo to apply for a tourist visa, a time-consuming and costly process with two children in tow. “They don’t very often open, so it was much harder” he said.\n\n“The new visa policies are 100% beneficial to us,” said Jenny Zhao, a managing director of WildChina, which specializes in boutique and luxury routes for international travelers. She said business is up 50% compared with before the pandemic.\n\nWhile the U.S. remains their largest source market, accounting for around 30% of their current business, European travelers now make up 15–20% of their clients, a sharp increase from less than 5% before 2019, according to Zhao. “We’re quite optimistic” Zhao said, “we hope these benefits will continue.”\n\nTrip.com Group, a Shanghai-based online travel agency, said the visa-free policy has significantly boosted tourism. Air, hotel and other bookings on their website for travel to China doubled in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year, with 75% of the visitors from visa-free regions.\n\nNo major African country is eligible for visa-free entry, despite the continent’s relatively close ties with China.\n\nNorth Americans and some others in transit can enter for 10 days\n\nThose from 10 countries not in the visa-free scheme have another option: entering China for up to 10 days if they depart for a different country than the one they came from. The policy is limited to 60 ports of entry, according to the country's National Immigration Administration.\n\nThe transit policy applies to 55 countries, but most are also on the 30-day visa-free entry list. It does offer a more restrictive option for citizens of the 10 countries that aren't: the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Sweden, Russia, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Indonesia, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nAside from the U.K., Sweden is the only other high-income European country that didn’t make the 30-day list. Ties with China have frayed since the rulingChinese Communist Party sentenced a Swedish book seller, Gui Minhai, to prison for 10 yearsin 2020. Gui disappeared in 2015 from his seaside home in Thailand but turned up months later in police custody in mainland China.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu and video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published on Jul. 8, 2025.

Manhart’s Instagram post\n\nThune says the big beautiful bill extends the Trump-era tax breaks for working families; plus no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and reduces taxes on social security recipients.\n\nHe also says small businesses will benefit, too.\n\n“There are about 100,000 small businesses in South Dakota that would have seen their tax rate that would have seen their tax rate go up to 40% if we hadn’t acted,” Thune said.\n\nThe bill also modernizes our military, strengthens our southern border and adds more ICE agents, Thune said.\n\nWhen it comes to cuts to Medicaid, it’s estimated nearly 12 million people will be impacted. But Thune says this bill will kick people off Medicaid who shouldn’t be on it.\n\n“Medicaid spending will continue to go up, just not like this, as it has in the past and in most cases it will be because there were people on the program who shouldn’t have been on the program; illegal immigrants, people who aren’t eligible, and people who should be working,” Thune said.\n\nThune says the same goes for cutting SNAP benefits.\n\n“One of the changes we are making in SNAP, like in Medicaid is, if you’re going to benefit from this program there is some expectations; that you would attempt to find a job or volunteer in your community or go back to school or do something that will enable you to be able to at some point be able to support yourself,” Thune said.\n\nThune: Passing OBBB was ‘hardest thing I’ve ever done’\n\nThune says the bill, which the Senate Finance Committee started working on last summer, is unprecedented.\n\n“Honestly as hard as it is, it’s just overdue, we just can’t keep on the path we are on or this country is headed for a really bad train wreck,” Thune said.\n\nThe bill also expands the child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $2,200.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"China extends visa-free entry to more than 70 countries to draw tourists",
    "News_text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Foreign tourists are trickling back to China after the country loosened its visa policy to unprecedented levels. Citizens from 74 countries can now enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, a big jump from previous regulations.\n\nThe government has been steadilyexpanding visa-free entryin a bid to boost tourism, the economy and its soft power. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 — almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.\n\n“This really helps people to travel because it is such a hassle to apply for a visa and go through the process,” Giorgi Shavadze, a Georgian living in Austria, said on a recent visit to the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.\n\nWhile most tourist sites are still packed with far more domestic tourists than foreigners, travel companies and tour guides are now bracing for a bigger influx in anticipation of summer holiday goers coming to China.\n\n“I’m practically overwhelmed with tours and struggling to keep up” says Gao Jun, a veteran English-speaking tour guide with over 20 years of experience. To meet growing demand, he launched a new business to train anyone interested in becoming an English-speaking tour guide. “I just can’t handle them all on my own” he said.\n\nAfterlifting tough COVID-19 restrictions, China reopened its borders to tourists in early 2023, but only 13.8 million people visited in that year, less than half the 31.9 million in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.\n\n30 days for many in Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Mideast\n\nIn December 2023, China announcedvisa-free entry for citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. Almost all of Europe has been added since then. Travelers fromfive Latin American countries and Uzbekistanbecame eligible last month, followed by four in the Middle East. The total will grow to 75 on July 16 with the addition of Azerbaijan.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the countries have been granted visa-free entry on a one-year trial basis.\n\nFor Norwegian traveler Øystein Sporsheim, this means his family would no longer need to make two round-trip visits to the Chinese embassy in Oslo to apply for a tourist visa, a time-consuming and costly process with two children in tow. “They don’t very often open, so it was much harder” he said.\n\n“The new visa policies are 100% beneficial to us,” said Jenny Zhao, a managing director of WildChina, which specializes in boutique and luxury routes for international travelers. She said business is up 50% compared with before the pandemic.\n\nWhile the U.S. remains their largest source market, accounting for around 30% of their current business, European travelers now make up 15–20% of their clients, a sharp increase from less than 5% before 2019, according to Zhao. “We’re quite optimistic” Zhao said, “we hope these benefits will continue.”\n\nTrip.com Group, a Shanghai-based online travel agency, said the visa-free policy has significantly boosted tourism. Air, hotel and other bookings on their website for travel to China doubled in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year, with 75% of the visitors from visa-free regions.\n\nNo major African country is eligible for visa-free entry, despite the continent’s relatively close ties with China.\n\nNorth Americans and some others in transit can enter for 10 days\n\nThose from 10 countries not in the visa-free scheme have another option: entering China for up to 10 days if they depart for a different country than the one they came from. The policy is limited to 60 ports of entry, according to the country's National Immigration Administration.\n\nThe transit policy applies to 55 countries, but most are also on the 30-day visa-free entry list. It does offer a more restrictive option for citizens of the 10 countries that aren't: the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Sweden, Russia, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, Indonesia, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nAside from the U.K., Sweden is the only other high-income European country that didn’t make the 30-day list. Ties with China have frayed since the rulingChinese Communist Party sentenced a Swedish book seller, Gui Minhai, to prison for 10 yearsin 2020. Gui disappeared in 2015 from his seaside home in Thailand but turned up months later in police custody in mainland China.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu and video producer Liu Zheng in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published on Jul. 8, 2025.

    "News_title":"California governor makes controversial decision to overhaul decades-old landmark rule: 'This was too urgent, too important'",
    "News_text":"California has changed its environmental rules to tackle housing shortages and homelessness. Gov. Gavin Newsom said, \"This was too urgent, too important, to allow the process to unfold as it has for the last generation,\"reportedThe Guardian.\n\nThe California Environmental Quality Act has been around since the 1970s. Think of it like the Transportation Security Administration for construction; it checks every detail before letting a project take off. Developers had to see how new builds might affect air, water, and wildlife. Lawmakers just passed two bills so most homes and apartments built in cities won't require these reviews anymore.\n\nNewsom told lawmakers he wouldn't sign the budget without these changes, which the Guardian summarized as resolving what advocates considered to be \"bureaucratic roadblocks\" from rules that were \"well-intentioned at the time.\"\n\nAssemblymember Buffy Wicks called the update \"a long-overdue step to stop CEQA from being weaponized against housing.\" State Sen. Scott Wiener said, \"It isn't easy to make changes this big, but Californians are demanding an affordable future, and it's our job to deliver for them no matter what.\"\n\nHousing advocates say the changes will cut costs and delays. However, some environmental groups think they could hurt communities already facing pollution. Laura Deehan from Environment California said, \"We're in a nature crisis, we're seeing unprecedented loss of wildlife, and that's to be made worse with this bill.\"\n\nThe Western Center on Law & Poverty said these bills \"undermine the public-participation process and the right to protect their community from environmental and health risks.\" Some fear exemptions for high-tech manufacturing sites could lead to toxic runoff and dirtier air in places already struggling.\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom waived CEQA rules for wildfire victims in southern California. Housing advocates called this change \"the biggest housing legislation in a generation.\" A spokesperson for California Yimby said CEQA \"has been used to stop affordable housing projects for years.\"\n\nHousing costs in California have been painful to even think about for many in the state. Supporters argue that building homes closer to jobs and schools means shorter commutes, cleaner air, and less time spent searching for parking in a city that often treats it like a buried treasure.\n\nIn Utah, foldable tiny homes are being explored to shelter people without housing. In West Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill to force oil and gas companies to fill old wells and do so more quickly, using cement. In another move, federal officials protected sage grouse habitats, possibly sparing them from becoming strip mine mascots.\n\nSome cities in California are fast-tracking infill permits so families can stay near shops and public transport. Residents concerned about these changes can speak at city council meetings and public hearings to help maintain strong protections.\n\nShould the government be allowed to restrict how much water we use?\n\nDefinitely\n\nOnly during major droughts\n\nNo way\n\nI'm not sure\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThese new rules might help put roofs over more heads. However, the tug-of-war between affordable housing and environmental risks isn't packing up anytime soon.\n\nJoin ourfree newsletterforgood newsanduseful tips, and don't missthis cool listof easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "News_text":"After the death toll in the catastrophic flash floods in Texas reached at least 104 people, including 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic, an all girls camp, the Trump administration is explaining the series of warnings that were issued ahead of the floods.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to visit Texas on Friday, after signing a disaster declaration Sunday. Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, has already traveled to the region, the White House press secretary said Monday.\n\nOut of the six impacted counties, Kerr County, home to Camp Mystic, was hit the hardest.\n\nThe Trump White House’s Faith Office asked the nation to join in praying for the victims, their families and first responders, who are still conducting “rescue missions for those still missing,” according to a statement.\n\nThe Faith Office called on the nation “to join us in prayer for the precious lives lost.”\n\nAs the nation reels from this fatal disaster, many questions linger.\n\nDid the federal weather predicting agency fail to relay information on time?\n\nOr was this disaster a once-in-a-lifetime kind of calamity that couldn’t have been avoided despite timely warnings, as Trump suggests?\n\nEveryone at the White House “is praying for the victims’ families and friends,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the wake of this once in a generation natural disaster, we have seen many falsehoods pushed by Democrats such as Senator Chuck Schumer and some members of the media,” she said.\n\n“Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning,” she added.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer asked the Department of Commerce’s acting inspector general to investigate whether vacancies at the NWS contributed to “delays, gaps, or diminished accuracy” in forecasting the weather emergencies.\n\nIn the letter, addressed to Roderick Anderson, the acting inspector general, Schumer said, “These are the experts responsible for modeling storm impacts, monitoring rising water levels, issuing flood warnings, and coordinating directly with local emergency managers about when to warn the public and issue evacuation orders.”\n\nHe also cited a New York Times report that said major forecasting and coordination positions at the NWS offices in San Antonio and San Angelo were vacant at the time of the flooding.\n\nLeavitt responded to Schumer and the Times report by relaying a series of facts leading to the tragedy.\n\n“The National Weather Service did its job despite unprecedented rainfall,” she noted.\n\nThe federal weather agency’s Texas offices in Austin and San Antonio carried out “forecast briefings for emergency management in the morning and issued a flood watch in the early afternoon.”\n\nThe NWS’ timely and precise warnings came three hours before the flooding, as the agency issued warnings on the night of July 3 and early morning of July 4.\n\nMeanwhile, “the National Weather Service office in New Braunfels, which delivers forecasts for Austin, San Antonio and the surrounding areas, had extra staff on duty during the storms, despite claims of the contrary,” the White House press secretary said.\n\nTom Fahy, legislative director of the NWS Employees Organization, toldNBC News, “The (weather forecasting offices) had adequate staffing and resources as they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm.”\n\nThe warning systems were functioning that day, starting with the NWS’ initial alert about a flood watch at 1:18 p.m. on July 3.\n\nIf the staffing and alert system wasn’t a problem, then what went wrong?\n\nState officials in Texas said the NWS issued inaccurate rainfall predictions early on.\n\n“The original forecast that we received on Wednesday from the National Weather Service predicted 3 to 6 inches of rain in the Concho Valley and 4 to 8 inches of rain in the Hill Country,” said Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management,at a news conference Friday.\n\n“The amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of those forecasts nonetheless.”\n\nTrump defended the NWS, saying the flooding was “a 100-year catastrophe.”\n\nPlus, it’s tough to concretely predict the intensity or duration of thunderstorms days in advance, and the forecasts became more accurate closer to the weather event.\n\nKidd said some folks don’t have cell service and probably didn’t get any messages from the weather service.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how many alert systems you sign up for, you’re not going to get that.”\n\nIn April, the Trump administration laid off and encouraged workers to opt for early retirement across federal agencies. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the NWS, lost about 600 employees at the time.\n\nAt the time, five former NWS directors in alettersaid that the staffing cuts could negatively impact weather forecasting.\n\nThe letter noted the firing and retirements created a 10% staffing deficit at the NWS ahead of a busy season of weather forecasting, marred by tornadoes and hurricanes.\n\nThere were no indications that any of the vacancies affected forecasting or the issuance of warnings ahead of the Texas floods, and Trump didn’t conclusively say whether he would hire back any NWS staff.\n\n“This was a thing that happened in seconds — nobody saw it,\" Trump told reporters on Sunday.",

The unprecedented funding came from Governor Ron DeSantis’s $117 billion budget, which also includes $637 million to completely support the Bright Futures Scholarship Program and more than $4.1 billion for the State University System. Bethune-Cookman University, Florida Memorial University, and Edward Waters University will also receive funding in addition to Florida A&M.\n\nThe additional funds expand on previous state contributions, including the record-breaking grant to Edward Waters last year and ongoing operating assistance to Florida A&M.

This historical amount of funding comes shortly after Florida A&Mnames Marva Johnson as the 13th president of the university.\n\nHBCUs can engage in long-term growth while maintaining financial stability with this year’s budget. Florida’s financing represents a change in the way state institutions are maintained and supported, as the importance of HBCUs gains more national attention.\n\nLike the HBCUs in Florida, the $20 million given to Grambling State will also go toward academic, athletic, and campus infrastructure projects. The funding will be used for much-needed improvements to the Grambling State campus, such as new classrooms, student resources, and upgraded sports facilities.\n\nThe funding comes as the chronic funding disparity between HBCUs and their largely white rivals is becoming more widely recognized. For many years, state governments have consistently underfunded public HBCUs, in particular.\n\nRecent initiatives have put the spotlight on these issues, including lobbying by politicians, student leaders, and alumni. While the funding allocation for Grambling is a step forward, it also highlights the amount of work that remains for many schools.\n\nRelated:15-year-old starts HBCU journey alongside his brothers\n\nRelated:WNBA legend Sheryl Swoopes imitated as an honorary member of Sigma Gamma Rho",

Then they continued on with their tour guide.”\n\nCruz was back on the airwaves from Texas on Monday morning, telling reporters that he had been in contact with local authorities and the president within hours of the floods to seek support and resources for the community.\n\nHe also appeared live onFox & Friendsfrom Kerrville, Texas, in the area hardest hit by the disaster, and posted a number of messages to X.\n\n“There aren’t words to describe the grief that Texans are feeling. Pray for Texas and Kerr County,” he wrote.\n\nThe devastating floods dumped more than a month’s worth of rain in parts of central Texas, killing more than 100 people, including 27 children, according to officials.\n\nSome Democrats have questioned whether Trump’s cuts to the federal government could have impacted the human toll of the disaster.\n\nHowever, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called this a “depraved lie.” She said a flood watch was issued in the early afternoon of Thursday, July 3, followed by a flash flood warning that night and the early morning of July 4, “giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours before flash flooding conditions occurred.\n\n“Despite unprecedented rainfall, the National Weather Service executed timely and precise forecasts and warnings,” Leavitt said.\n\n“Many Democratic elected officials are trying to turn this into a political game.

    "News_title":"Indiana misses out on good ideas by caring more about politics than results | Opinion",
    "News_text":"The surprise New York City mayoral primary win by democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has sent the internet overreaction machine into overdrive.\n\nFolks on the left are heralding a new era of populist governance, where the people stick it to the oligarchy and the government takes an aggressive stance against economic inequality. Meanwhile, centrists and the right are apoplectic, warning that Mamdani’s socialist experiments — like city-owned grocery stores — could be the final blow to a city still fragile after the pandemic.\n\nWho’s right? No one knows. He might not even win the general election. But let’s say he does. His grocery store proposal is just a modest pilot: one publicly owned store in each of NYC’s five boroughs. He’s been up front about it being an experiment that he’s willing to end if it doesn’t work. Personally, I probably side with the critics, because grocery retail is a low-margin business that is hardly plagued by runaway profiteering.\n\nBut the response to this one idea reflects a larger and more frustrating pattern in how we talk about policy: the immediate need to sort everything into winners and losers. Positions are often staked out in advance, usually based on ideology or personal interest. And if we don’t learn to resist that impulse, we risk squandering a rare opportunity, because right now, all across the country, state and local governments are trying bold and potentially consequential things.\n\nFrom the left, several purple states with temporary Democratic trifectas are moving quickly to enact longstanding progressive priorities. Minnesota stands out. Historically a state with divided government that has recently been under unified Democratic control, Minnesota hasmoved quicklyand legalized cannabis, implemented paid family leave, expanded health insurance access (including for undocumented residents), increased voting access, made public college free, and ensured universal school meals.\n\nOf course, this hasn’t come without familiar (and sometimes fair) critiques about overspending and creeping socialism.\n\nRed states, for their part, are launching their own bold experiments. One of the most sweeping is the expansion of school vouchers. InArkansas, for example, eligibility now includes nearly all residents, even homeschoolers. Critics have responded with the usual warnings about undermining public education and funneling public money to religious institutions.\n\nBut taken together, these differing policy approaches form something extraordinary: what academics would call a “natural experiment.” States are testing sharply divergent ideas. If we can examine the outcomes without ideological blinders, we could learn a lot about what works, what doesn’t and what might be worth adapting elsewhere. There are plenty of examples from other states, as well: Idaho’s human servicesderegulation, or New Mexico’s universalfree childcare, to name a couple.\n\nBriggs:Mike Braun's tuition freeze for Indiana colleges is a marketing gimmick\n\nAnd here’s the crucial point:allof these experiments might fail. Maybe Arkansas’s voucher expansion accelerates inequality and further hollows out the public education system. Maybe Minnesota’s sweeping social investments prove to be too expensive or fall well short of promised outcomes.\n\nBut, like we all teach our children, failure is not something to avoid, but rather a necessary step in learning. If we’re serious about governing better, we have to treat policy more like science: formulate the hypothesis, test it, and adjust based on what happens.\n\nThat’s the theory, anyway. But here’s where reality gets in the way.\n\nI call it the hierarchy of persuasion. In red states like Indiana, the types of evidence that actually move policymakers follow a strict pecking order. At the top are personal stories of impact, ideally told by trusted local figures like a sheriff, school superintendent or judge. Just below that are hard numbers: not vague projections of long-term ROI, but specific, measurable cost savings. Then come in-state pilot projects or research. Below that, case studies from other red states.\n\nAnd at the very bottom — so low it might as well not exist — is evidence from blue states.\n\nThis is not written down anywhere, but anyone who’s spent time advocating at the Indiana Statehouse knows it well. One of the weirdest moments in my career came during a virtual town hall where I shared our vision for a comprehensive crisis response system. As part of the presentation, I referenced an example from Oregon. Someone asked, “Why are we looking at a program from a place that doesn’t share our values?” It caught me off guard because I hadn’t thought of crisis response as something that could be ideological. But the question reveals how the source of an idea can shape whether it’s taken seriously, regardless of its merits.\n\nOpinionIndiana's 'free market' rental laws are rigged in favor of landlords\n\nThis mindset is costing us because it cuts Indiana off from some of the most effective strategies to solve tough problems, just because they’re coming from places we’ve written off.\n\nSo yes, it’s good that states are trying new things. But if we want this moment of experimentation to actually lead somewhere, we need to stop askingwhois doing it, and start askingis it working?\n\nThe silver lining of our extremely polarized times is that people are trying new and unprecedented approaches to our toughest problems. But if we want to reap the benefits, we have to be open to good ideas, regardless of where they come from.\n\nJay Chaudhary is the former director of the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction and chair of the Indiana Behavioral Health Commission. He writes the Substack,Favorable Thriving Conditions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star:Indiana rejects good ideas from blue states over politics | Opinion",

    "News_text":"The Trump administration’s broadsides against scientific research have caused unprecedented upheaval at the National Cancer Institute, the storied federal government research hub that has spearheaded advances against the disease for decades.\n\nNCI, which has long benefited from enthusiastic bipartisan support, now faces an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers, some fired, others leaving in exasperation.\n\nAfter years of accelerating progress that has reduced cancer deaths by a third since the 1990s, the institute has terminated funds nationwide for research to fight the disease, expand care, and train new oncologists. “We use the word ‘drone attack’ now regularly,” one worker said of grant terminations. “It just happens from above.”\n\nThe assault could well result in a perceptible slowing of progress in the fight against cancer.\n\nNearly 2 million Americans are diagnosed with malignancies every year. In 2023, cancer killed more than613,000 people, making it the second leading cause of death after heart disease. But the cancer fight has also made enormous progress. Cancer mortality in the U.S. hasfallen by 34% since 1991, according to the American Cancer Society. There are roughly18 million cancer survivorsin the country.\n\nThat trend “we can very, very closely tie to the enhanced investment in cancer science by the U.S. government,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and a globally recognized expert on prostate cancer.\n\n“We’re winning,” Knudsen said. “Why we would let up, I really don’t understand.”\n\nThis article is based on interviews with nearly two dozen current and former NCI employees, academic researchers, scientists, and patients. KFF Health News agreed not to name some government workers because they are not authorized to speak to the news media and fear retaliation.\n\n“It’s horrible. It’s a crap show. It really, really is,” said an NCI laboratory chief who has worked at the institute for three decades. He’s lost six of the 30 people in his lab this year: four scientists, a secretary, and an administrator.\n\n“If we survive I will be somewhat surprised,” he said.\n\nAfter a mandate by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Government Efficiency to slash contract spending by more than a third, the cancer institute is cutting contracts to maintain precious biological specimens used in their research, according to three scientists. “The required contract cuts are going to be devastating,” a senior scientist said.\n\nOn the NCI campus in Bethesda, Maryland, scientists describe delays in getting essential supplies — “literally anything that goes into a test tube or a petri dish,” a recently departed clinician said — because of staffing cuts and constant changes in policies about what they can order.\n\nEven the websites that publish new evidence on cancer treatment and diagnosis aren’t being updated, because HHS fired workers who managed them. And when NCI scientists do communicate with outsiders, what they say has been severely restricted, according to documents viewed by KFF Health News. Forbidden topics include mass firings, President Donald Trump’s executive orders, and “DEIA” – diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\n\nThe turmoil at the National Institutes of Health’s largest arm could haunt the country and the world for years to come.\n\n“I really, really don’t understand what they’re trying to achieve,” said Sarah Kobrin, chief of NCI’s health systems and interventions research branch. “It just doesn’t make sense.”\n\n“Efforts that are lifesaving now are being curtailed,” one scientist said. “People will die.”\n\nInitially, some workers said, they thought the cancer institute might be spared. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called chronic disease — cancer is one —“an existential threat”to the country. Cancer research, with multiple NCI-funded breakthroughs in genetics and immunotherapy, has sidestepped the political minefields around other public health issues, like vaccination.\n\n“People who care about cancer might be the biggest lobby in the country,” said Paul Goldberg, editor and publisher of The Cancer Letter, which has monitored oncology science and policy since 1973.\n\nCount Mike Etchamendy, 69, of Big Bear Lake, California, as part of that lobby. Since 2013 he’s flown to the East Coast scores of times to participate in five clinical trials at the cancer wing of NIH’s Clinical Center.\n\n“They call it the House of Hope,” Etchamendy said. Between drugs, therapeutic vaccines, and expert treatment for his rare bone cancer, called chordoma, he said, he believes he’s gained at least 10 years of life. He’s proud to have served as a “lab rat for science” and worries about NCI’s future.\n\n“People come from all over the world to learn there,” Etchamendy said. “You cut funding there, you’re going to cut major research on cancer.”\n\nIn response to a list of detailed questions from KFF Health News about the cuts and chaos at NCI, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the reporting amounted to a “biased narrative” that “misrepresents a necessary transformation at the National Cancer Institute.” Nixon declined to elaborate but said research into cancer and other health conditions continues to be a high priority “for both NIH and HHS.”\n\n“We are refocusing resources on high-impact, evidence-based research — free from ideological bias or institutional complacency. While change can be uncomfortable for those invested in the status quo, it is essential to ensure that NCI delivers on its core mission,” he said.\n\nMuch of NCI’s work is authorized by the National Cancer Act of 1971, which expanded its mandate as part of President Richard Nixon’s “War on Cancer.” Three of four of the cancer institute’s research dollars go to outside scientists, with most of the remainder funding more than 300 scientists on campus.\n\nAnd Congress was generous. Harold Varmus,one of more than 40 Nobel laureateswhose work was funded by NCI, said budgets were usually handsome when he was NIH director from 1993 through 1999. President Bill Clinton “would say to me, ‘I’d like to give you a bigger increase, Harold, but your friends in Congress will bring it up.’ He’d offer me a 5% increase,” Varmus recalled, but “I’d end up getting more like 10%” from Congress.\n\nCongress appropriated $2 billion to NCI in fiscal 1993. By 2025, funding had risen to $7.22 billion.\n\nDuring a May 19 town hall meeting with NIH staff members, Jay Bhattacharya, the institute’s new director, equivocated when asked about funding cuts for research into improving the health of racial and ethnic minorities — cuts made under the guise of purging DEI from the government.\n\nAccording to a recording of the meeting obtained by KFF Health News, Bhattacharya said the agency remained “absolutely committed to advancing the health and well-being of every population, including minority populations, LGBTQ populations, and every population.”\n\nResearch addressing the health needs of women and minorities is “an absolute priority of mine,” he said. “We’re going to keep funding that.” But a study considering whether “structural racism causes poor health in minority populations” is “not a scientific hypothesis.”\n\n“We need scientific ideas that are actionable, that improve the health and well-being of people, not ideological ideas that don’t have any chance of improving the health and well-being of people,” he said. That comment angered many staffers, several said in interviews. Many got up and walked out during the speech, while others, watching remotely, scoffed or jeered.\n\nSeveral current and former NCI scientists questioned Bhattacharya’s commitment to young scientists and minorities. Staffing cuts early in the year eliminated many recently hired NCI scientists. At least 172 National Cancer Institute grants, including for research aimed at minimizing health disparities among racial minorities or LGBTQ+ people, were terminated and hadn’t been reinstated as of June 16, according to a KFF Health News analysis of HHS documents and a list of grant terminations by outside researchers.\n\nThose populations have higher rates of certain cancer diagnoses and are more likely to be diagnosed later than white or heterosexual people. Black people are alsomore likely to dieof many cancer types than all other racial and ethnic groups.\n\nJennifer Guida, a researcher who focuses on accelerated aging in cancer survivors, said she recently left NCI after a decade in part because of the administration’s DEI orders. According to several workers and internal emails viewed by KFF Health News, those included an HHS edict in January to report their colleagues who worked on such issues, and flagging grants that included DEI-related terms because they didn’t align with Trump’s priorities.\n\n‘I’m not going to put my name attached to that. I don’t stand for that. It’s not OK,” said Guida, who added that it amounted to a “scrubbing of science.”\n\nRacial discrimination isone factorthat contributes to accelerated aging. “There are a growing number of cancer survivors in the U.S.,” Guida said, and “a significant number of those people who will become cancer survivors are racial and ethnic minorities.”\n\n“Those people deserve to be studied,” she said. “How can you help those people if you’re not even studying them?”\n\nIn May, NCI informed leaders of the Comprehensive Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity, a program that links 14 large U.S. cancer centers with minority-serving colleges and universities, that their funding would be cut. The project’s Notice of Funding Opportunity — the mechanism the government uses to award grants — had been suddenly taken offline, meaning NCI staffers couldn’t award future funding, according to three sources and internal communications viewed by KFF Health News. These “unpublishings” have often occurred without warning, explanation, or even notification of the grantee that no more money would be coming.\n\nThe cancer partnerships have trained more than 8,500 scientists. They’re designed to address widely documented disparities in cancer care by having top medical schools place students from rural, poor, and minority-serving schools and community clinics in research, training, and outreach.\n\nResearch shows that patients from racial and ethnic minorities receive better medical care and have improved outcomes when their clinicians share their background.\n\n“I’m from an immigrant family, the first to graduate in my family,” said Elena Martinez, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California-San Diego, who leads one of the partnerships with colleagues at largely Hispanic Cal State-San Diego. “I wouldn’t be here without this kind of program, and there won’t be people like me here in the future if we cut these programs.”\n\nIn early April, when the dust settled after mass firings across HHS, workers in NCI’s communications office were relieved they still had their jobs.\n\nIt didn’t last. A month later, HHS fired nearly all of them, three former workers said. Combined with retirements and other departures, a skeleton crew of six or seven remain of about 75 people. “We were all completely blindsided,” a fired worker said. NCI leadership “had no idea that this was happening.”\n\nAs a result, websites, newsletters, and other resources for patients and doctors about the latest evidence in cancer treatment aren’t being updated. They includeCancer.govand NCI’s widely used Physician Data Query, which compile research findings that doctors turn to when caring for cancer patients.\n\nGary Kreps, founding director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University, said he relied on Physician Data Query when his father was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer, taking PDQ printouts when he met with his dad’s doctors. “It made a huge difference,” Kreps said. “He ended up living, like, another three years” — longer than expected — “and enjoyed the rest of his life.”\n\nAs of May 30, banners at the top of the Cancer.gov and PDQ websites said, “Due to HHS restructuring and reduction in workforce efforts, the information on this website may not be up to date and pages will indicate as such.” The banners are gone, but neither website was being updated, according to a fired worker with knowledge of the situation.\n\nOutdated PDQ information is “really very dangerous,” Kreps said.\n\nWiping out NCI’s communications staff makes it harder to share complex and ever-changing information that doctors and patients need, said Peter Garrett, who headed NCI’s communications before retiring in May. Garrett said he left because of concerns about political interference.\n\n“The science isn’t finished until it’s communicated,” he said. “Without the government playing that role, who’s going to step in?”\n\nFollowing court decisions that blocked some NIH grant cancellations or rendered them “void” and “illegal,” NIH official Michelle Bulls in late June told staffers to stop terminating grants. However, NCI workers told KFF Health News they continue to review grants flagged by NIH to assess whether they align with Trump administration priorities. Courts have ordered NIH to reinstate some terminated grants, but not all of them.\n\nAt NCI and across NIH, staffers remain anxious.\n\nThe White House wants Congress to slash the cancer institute’s budget by nearly 40%, to$4.53 billion, as part of a larger proposal to sharply reduce NIH’s fiscal 2026 coffers.\n\nBhattacharya has said he wants NIH to fund more big, breakthrough research. Major cuts could have the opposite effect, Knudsen said. When NCI funding shrinks, “it’s the safe science that tends to get funded, not the science that is game changing and has the potential to be transformative for cures.”\n\nUsually the president’s budget is dead on arrival in Congress, and members of both parties have expressed doubt about Trump’s 2026 proposal. But agency workers, outside scientists, and patients fear this one may stick, with devastating impact.\n\nIt would force NCI to suspend all new grants or cut existing grants so severely that the gaps will close many labs, said Varmus, who ran NCI from 2010 to 2015. Add that to the impact on NCI’s contracts, clinical trials, internal research, and salaries, he said, and “you can reliably say that NCI will be unable to keep up in any way with the promise of science that’s currently underway.”\n\nThe NCI laboratory chief, who has worked at the institute for decades, put it this way: “If the 40% budget cut passes in Congress, it will destroy clinical research at NCI.”\n\nKFF Health News Correspondent Rae Ellen Bichell contributed to this report.\n\nKFF Health Newsis a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Liberia's Boakai apologises to war victims, honours slain presidents",
    "News_text":"MONROVIA (Reuters) -Liberian President Joseph Boakai has launched what his office describes as an unprecedented reconciliation campaign, overseeing memorial services for two assassinated presidents and issuing the government's first apology to war victims.\n\nThe high-profile ceremonies come more than two decades after the end of civil conflicts that resulted in some 200,000 deaths and saw widespread atrocities including massacres, rape and the use of child soldiers.\n\nThey also coincide with calls by human rights groups for domestic war crimes prosecutions which have yet to start despite an executive order to establish a war crimes court last year.\n\nBoakai's apology came on Saturday at an event in the capital Monrovia, where he pledged to make July 5 an annual day of remembrance.\n\n\"To every victim of our civil conflict, to every family broken, to every dream shattered, we say: 'We are sorry',\" he said.\n\nIn the lead-up to that event, Boakai attended a service honouring President Samuel Doe, who took power in a coup in 1980 and died at the hands of fighters loyal to warlord Prince Johnson in 1990, less than a year after fighting broke out in Liberia.\n\nJohnson, who died last year, went on to become a senator and political kingmaker, highlighting what critics describe as entrenched impunity.\n\nBoakai also recently spoke at a reburial service for President William Tolbert, who was executed in the 1980 coup. That putsch also saw the public executions of 13 members of Tolbert's cabinet on a beach in Monrovia.\n\n\"It still hurts,\" said Charlotte Stewart, whose father, former budget director Frank J. Stewart, was among the 13 senior officials killed.\n\n\"I really do believe that it will bring some closure.\"\n\nCALL FOR TRIALS\n\nLiberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 issued a final report recommending war-related prosecutions at an extraordinary criminal court, but none have taken place on Liberian soil.\n\nLast year Boakai signed an executive order to establish a war crimes court, and in April he renewed the order as it had been due to expire.\n\nAlain Werner, director of the Geneva-based group Civitas Maxima that has successfully pushed for the prosecution of several Liberians in foreign courts, said Boakai should do more to make the local court operational.\n\n\"It is great he is apologizing. Others before him did not do that and it is important for the victims and survivors,\" Werner said.\n\n\"But he should also ensure the office for the war crimes court gets the money it needs to function as soon as possible for the work to start in earnest, finally.\"\n\nYvette Chesson Wureh, daughter of former Justice Minister Joseph Chesson who was killed in the 1980 coup, called on Liberia to confront its history.\n\n\"Justice was denied. And with it, the principles of fairness and humanity that should define us as a people.\"\n\n(Reporting by Carielle DoeWriting by Robbie Corey-BouletEditing by Gareth Jones)",

    "News_title":"Education Department dismisses thousands of civil rights complaints at an ‘unheard of’ pace",
    "News_text":"The Education Department dismissed civil rights complaints at such a rapid clip this year that former officials and advocates are concerned about a core agency function amid Trump administration plans to make deep staffing cuts.\n\nIn court documents filed last week, the department disclosed that its Office for Civil Rights dismissed 3,424 complaints between March 11 and June 27 “consistent with OCR’s Case Processing Manual.” The documents state that 96 complaints were \"resolved\" because of insufficient evidence during an investigation — and another 290 complaints with voluntary agreements, settlements or technical assistance.\n\nDuring that time period, OCR received 4,833 complaints, opened 309 for investigation and opened 26 directed investigations, according to a court declaration filed as part of acase that challenged the agency’s decisionto conduct a sweeping reduction in force. Unlike most investigations, directed or self-initiated investigations are launched by the agency without someone filing a formal complaint about a school, college or university.\n\n“The nation’s students and schools deserve a robust federal civil rights enforcement office that is fully equipped and prepared to enforce the full range of rights Congress guaranteed in law,” Catherine Lhamon, the department’s civil rights chief under former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, said in a statement to POLITICO. “The Trump Administration’s own data reporting shows it has decimated its ability to fulfill its statutory duties, to the detriment of rights in school.”\n\nThe department has focused its civil rights efforts on stamping out campus antisemitism, ending protections for transgender student athletes and eliminating all traces of diversity, equity and inclusion in education since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Colleges and universities that have not adhered to Trump's directives have had millions of dollars in federal aid frozen, become the focus of federal investigations and faced a torrent of public criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans.\n\nCivil rights advocates say they are concerned about the high number of dismissals because the Trump administration interprets federal civil rights laws that address sex-based discrimination and discrimination based on race, national origin and shared ancestry differently from the Biden administration.\n\nUnder Education Secretary Linda McMahon, discrimination in these categories no longer includes gender identity andLGBTQ+ challenges against book bans. They now include the Trump administration’srule on how schools must respond to sexual misconductand higher levels of scrutiny of antisemitism on campus andrace-inclusive programminglike affinity graduations.\n\nThe Education Department declined to answer a series of detailed questions about its civil rights work but said all of OCR’s actions align with federal law.\n\n“OCR has taken unprecedented steps to streamline its functions according to demand: for example, amid a growing volume of Title IX complaints, OCR partnered with the Department of Justice to expeditiously investigate sex-based discrimination claims,” agency spokesperson Julie Hartman said in a statement. “OCR’s daily accomplishments under the Trump Administration disprove the rampant fear-mongering by irresponsible media, and evince that OCR is vigorously upholding its responsibilities to protect all Americans’ civil rights.\"\n\nAdvocates fear this new policy agenda is taking a toll on the routine work of an office that is responsible for investigating a range of problems including campus sexual misconduct and claims of discrimination in special education.\n\nMcMahon has also pledged to enact Trump's policies even with a slimmed down staff. Seven of the department’s 12 regional civil rights offices across the country were eliminated during themassive reduction in force in March. Those offices are in Boston, Dallas, New York, Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco and Philadelphia. A federal judge in Massachusetts, however,ordered those workers be called back,saying the mass layoffs “leaves OCR with the capacity to address only a small fraction of the complaints that it receives.”\n\nBy contrast, during the last three months of the Biden administration, OCR dismissed 2,527 cases, resolved 449 with resolution agreements for change, secured 146 successful mediations, and determined there was no violation in 119 cases.\n\nThe difference between the number of mediated or voluntary resolution cases recorded in the last three months of the Biden administration, when compared to the number of resolutions disclosed by the Trump administration within three months earlier this year, “reflects a shocking diminution of work output from the office,” Lhamon said.\n\nOne former agency official, granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation from the Trump administration, was stunned by the new data.\n\n“That amount of dismissals in a three-month period is unheard of,” the former official, who worked in OCR and was at the department for about 20 years, said. “If they dismiss that amount of cases in a matter of three months, then they're not following the procedures. What it sounds like they're doing to me is they're just dismissing cases that they don't want to take the time to investigate, or put the resources into.”\n\nThere are few instances where the office will dismiss a complaint, they said. If the complaint doesn’t have enough information and OCR can’t get in touch with the person who filed it, that would be grounds for dismissal. They would also dismiss a case if someone were to complain about a school that doesn’t receive federal funding and therefore doesn’t fall within OCR’s jurisdiction.\n\n“But those types of complaints are very rare,” the former official said. “Maybe one in a thousand.”\n\nSimilarconcerns about the number of dismissalsemerged during the first Trump administration as the agency sought to reduce a massive backlog of cases in 2017. OCR at the time closed more than 1,500 civil rights complaints and dismissed more than 900 outright in roughly two months after issuing a directive to agency investigators.\n\n“We should be concerned about that amount, especially given the way that this administration has prioritized weaponizing civil rights laws and distorting these laws,” said Shiwali Patel, senior director of safe and inclusive schools at the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nShe said the number of dismissals signals that students and parents “can't rely on this administration to protect them from discrimination.”",

    "News_title":"Watching the world, one quintillionth of a second at a time",
    "News_text":"Just about anybody who played hide-and-seek as a kid remembers counting, with eyes (presumably) covered, in units of one-one-thousand. “One-one-thousand. Two-one-thousand. Three-one-thousand.” It’s one way to develop a feel for the duration of a second. If you live to be 80 years old, you will experience 2,522,880,000 seconds, not any one of which feels like a long time. When you think about time, it’s usually in many-second durations, like minutes, days and years. Unless you become a world-class athlete where differences measured in tenths, hundredths and maybe even thousandths of seconds can mean winning or losing Olympic gold, you might not think intervals shorter than a second are worth a second thought.\n\nBut what if you allow yourself to imagine what happens in the world at ever shorter time intervals? What if you had a temporal microscope for zooming in on time the way optical,electronand scanning tunneling microscopes let you zero in on ever finer spatial dimensions, even down to the atomic scale?\n\nKnowable Magazinewelcomes you to the world of a cadre of scientists, some of them Nobel Prize winners, who live in the fastest science lane possible right now — the realm of attoseconds. By leveraging the evolution of laser science and technology, they have trained their attention on molecular, atomic and electronic behavior of ever finer temporal durations — from millionths (micro) to billionths (nano) to trillionths (pico) to quadrillionths (femto) to quintillionths (atto) of seconds.\n\nIt’s in the attosecond-by-attosecond time frame that the sausage of physics and chemistry is made and can be probed. It is where light and electrons do much of the blindingly fast negotiation by which the energy they have to give and take redistributes as they interact. These are temporal realms that set the stage for many chemistry antics: things like electrons shifting between excited higher-energy states and lower-energy states and molecules morphing from reactants into products.\n\nIn these instants, a chemical ring might open, an electron might fly away, leaving a positively charged ion behind, or a photon might beam outward carrying spectroscopic intel that helps scientists figure out what just happened. These are the hidden micromatters that contribute to everything from photosynthesis in leaves to the photophysical basis of vision and the bond-making and -breaking that underlie themulti-trillion-dollar chemical industry.\n\nTo those who wield state-of-the-art laser systems and light detectors to capture glimpses of the exquisitely fast happenings in these tiny contexts, even a microsecond or nanosecond can seem like an awfully long time. When you can watch molecules and reactions in attosecond time frames, “there’s this vast other space that is open to you,” says Stephen Leone, a physical chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, whochronicled his lifelong research adventureas an “attosecond chemist” in an autobiographical essay in a 2023 issue of the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry. With short-enough pulses, he says, you can begin to observe the very movements of electrons that underlie the breaking or making of a chemical bond.\n\nHere is what one attosecond looks like when you write it out: 0.000000000000000001 s. That’s a billionth of a billionth of a second. An oh-wow factoid that attosecond aficionados sometimes roll out is that there are as many attoseconds in 1 second as there have been seconds ticking since the Big Bang. One tick on your kitchen clock amounts to an eternity of attoseconds. Here’s another head-shaking attosecond fact: In 1 attosecond, light — which moves at the incomprehensible sprint of 186,000 miles per second — travels the span of a single atom.\n\nAttoseconds are a natural time frame for atoms and their electrons, says John Gillaspy, a research physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and former program director of atomic, molecular and optical experimental physics at the National Science Foundation. “When you think about an electron orbiting a nucleus like a little planet moving around the Sun,” he says, “the time scale for the orbit is about 1 to 1,000 attoseconds.” He concedes that he often defers to this early 20th-century metaphor for atoms because, he says, in a spirit of commiseration, “if you try to envision them quantum mechanically, you’re liable to get quite confused and disturbed.”\n\nTo do attosecond science, you might start with a top-line femtosecond laser that produces millionths-of-billionths-of-a-second infrared pulses. Then, to produce even shorter-wavelength attosecond laser pulses, you likely will need a pulse-shortening technique, called high harmonic generation (HHG), which won some of its developers the2023 Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nLeone has put such tools and techniques to use in what are called pump-probe studies. These have two main parts. First, he and his team might vent a gas of, say, krypton atoms or methane molecules into the pathway of laser pulses. These pulses carry the photons that will interact with electrons in the sample particles. Then the scientists direct attosecond laser pulses at the sample at different delay times after the initial pulse, taking pains to measure the electromagnetic signals or electrons that emerge. The attosecond-precise monitoring of these signals can amount to a stop-motion movie of electrons, atoms or molecules.\n\nIn deep chemistry speak, Leone lists some of the attosecond- and femtosecond-fast shifts in electronic energy states and behavior that such techniques have opened to observations in unprecedented detail: chemical bond breaking, yes, but also more subtle yet influential energetic happenings that can thwart reactions or nudge molecules to change shape. These are phenomena in which theory has long outpaced experimental data. These subtler actions include “curve crossings” and “conical intersections,” which are terms reflective of the mathematical and geometric depictions of the energy-constrained behavioral “choices” electrons have to make in atoms and molecules.\n\nDoes this or that electron hold on to enough energy to cause a bond to break? Or does it vent that energy within the molecule or material more gently to elicit, say, a vibration between bonded atoms, or morph the molecule’s shape from one isomer to another?\n\nThese secret, on-the-fly choices made by electrons leave their traces all over in our biology and could have practical applications — such as repairing broken chromosomes, detecting diseases from chemical hints in the molecular brew of our blood, or engineering laser pulses to produce never-before-seen molecules. “We didn’t understand any of this detail previously and now, I think, it has come into much greater clarity,” Leone says. It suggests ways to elicit specific electronic motions that one needs to break this or that bond or to cause a desired reaction, he adds.\n\nThe hushed, darkened labs of these laser-wielding experimentalists have an otherworldly feel. A typical centerpiece is a vibration-suppression table with surfaces as still as any place on Earth. Painstakingly aligned, there are miniature Stonehenges of lenses and crystal elements that shift, split and recombine laser beams, compress or expand light pulses, and impart tiny delays into when pulses reach samples and detectors. Feeding into these optical pathways are the ultrashort laser pulses and, downstream, the sample atoms and molecules (supplied from nozzles attached to gas tanks or from heated crystals).\n\nMuch of these setups must reside in steampunk-esque vacuum chambers so that air molecules don’t sop up the precious data-bearing light or electron signals before they can make it to detectors and spectrometers.\n\n“It’s all a very complicated camera to produce some of the shortest events in time that humans can produce,” says theoretical chemist Daniel Keefer of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz, Germany, coauthor of a 2023 article in the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry onthe applications of ultrafast X-ray and HHG for probing molecules.\n\nKeefer’s primary tasks include calculating for experimentalists the laser-pulse energies and other conditions most suitable for the studies they plan to do, or helping them infer the electronic behavior in molecules hidden in the spectroscopic data they collect in the lab. But as elementary as these studies can be, some of the phenomena he has studied are as relevant to everyone as keeping their genes intact and functioning.\n\nConsider that the combination of ultrafast laser pulses and spectroscopic observation empowered him and colleagues to better understand how some of the celebrity molecules of biology, RNA and DNA, manage to quickly dissipate enough of the energy of incoming ultraviolet photons to prevent that energy from wreaking gene-wrecking, photochemical damage. It comes down to the way electrons within the molecules can benignly vent the UV energy by going back to their lowest-energy orbitals.\n\n“This is one mechanism by which potential photodamage is prevented in living organisms exposed to sunlight,” Keefer says. These genetic molecules “absorb UV light all the time and we’re not having a lot of photodamage because they can just get rid of the energy almost instantaneously, and that greatly reduces the risk of your DNA breaking.”\n\nTo generate attosecond laser pulses, scientists first ping a gas of atoms with an infrared laser. The laser beam gives a kick to every atom it passes, shaking the electrons back and forth in lockstep with its infrared light waves. This forces the electrons to emit new light waves. But they do so with overtones, the way a guitar string vibrates at not only a fundamental frequency but also a range of higher-frequency harmonic vibrations, or acoustic overtones. In the case of infrared laser light, the overtones are at much higher frequencies in the attosecond range, which correspond to ultraviolet or even X-ray wavelengths.\n\nThat’s a huge bonus for attosecond scientists. When packed into supershort pulses, light of these wavelengths can carry sufficient energy to cause electrons to migrate within a molecule’s framework. That influences how the molecule will react. Or the laser pulses can coerce electrons to leave the scene entirely, which is one of the ways atoms and molecules become ionized.\n\nGillaspy says that when he thinks of attosecond pulses of light, and yet-shorter pulses in the future (which would be measured in zeptoseconds), his science dreams diverge from spying on the private lives of electrons and toward what becomes possible by packing more energy into ever shorter pulses. Do this, Gillaspy says, and the power confined in the pulse can amplify, albeit ever so briefly, to astronomical levels. It’s akin to the way a magnifying glass can concentrate a dull, palm-sized patch of sunlight into a pinpoint of brilliant sunlight that can ignite a piece of paper.\n\nConcentrate enough laser power into a short-enough pulse, Gillaspy says, and you might gain access to the quantum vacuum, by which he means the lowest possible energy state that space can have. The quantum vacuum has only been indirectly measured and it sports a generous share of weirdness. Presumably, for example, the “nothingness” of that vacuum actually seethes with “virtual” matter-antimatter particle pairs that poof into and out of existence by the bazillions, in slices of time even faster than attoseconds.\n\n“If you could get the laser intensity strong enough you might rip apart the virtual particles from each other in the quantum vacuum and make them real” — which is to say, observable, says Gillaspy. In other words, it could become possible to separate, detect and measure the members of those transient pairs of virtual particles before they annihilate each other and disappear back into the vacuum. “This is where we could be ripe for fundamental discoveries,” Gillaspy says — although for now, he notes, the capability to produce the required laser intensities remains far off.\n\nJun Ye, a physicist at JILA, a joint research center of the University of Colorado and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is deploying attosecond physics in pursuit of another believe-it-or-not goal. He intends to tap HHG to detect that mysterious cosmic stuff known as dark matter.\n\nDespite never having directly detected dark matter in everyday life or in a laboratory, scientists presume its existence to make sense of the distribution and motions of matter on galactic scales. Without the presence ofdark matter— in far more abundance than ordinary matter — and its cosmic-scale gravitational influences, theuniversewould literally look and behave differently. If the theory is true, a tantalizing consequence is that dark matter — whatever it is — should be abundantly present all around us here on Earth, and so should be, in principle, detectable in a lab.\n\nYe is hoping to exploit HHG physics to develop a type of energy-measuring technique, called nuclear spectroscopy, that is especially suited to discern subtle energy shifts in the nuclei of atoms. In this context, it’s the multitude of wavelengths of light that HHG naturally produces that make this spectroscopic technique so revealing. This, Ye says, could enable him to monitor minute variations in regular-matter atoms that might be caused by previously unknown interactions with dark matter.\n\nAt the heart of his plan is a new type of clock, a nuclear clock, that he and colleagues at JILA and elsewhere have been developing. The ticks of these clocks are based on nuclear oscillations (in the bundle of neutrons and protons in thorium-229 nuclei) rather than the electronic oscillations atomic clocks have been based on.\n\n“If the dark matter out there interacts with regular matter, then potentially it will interact with neutrons and protons in atomic nuclei differently than with electrons,” Ye says. And if that is so, comparisons of spectroscopy data from the two types of clocks stand a chance of finally unveiling a dark matter influence on normal matter that has been in operation all along.\n\n“This is how a lot of things start,” says Gillaspy. “Breakthroughs can start with physicists and chemists just getting fascinated by some new thing, like attosecond phenomena, and then . . . you never know. You don’t even imagine what kind of capabilities are going to arise from that.”\n\nThis storywas produced byKnowable Magazineand reviewed and distributed byStacker.",

    "News_title":"Mysterious Guided Rocket Launcher Disguised In A Shipping Container At Fort Bragg Identified",
    "News_text":"An unknown containerized launcher able to fire the samesuite of artillery rockets and ballistic missilesas theM270 Multiple Launch Rocket System(MLRS) andM142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System(HIMARS) seen atthe U.S. Army’s Fort Bragg earlier this yearhas been identified. This comes as the Army’s top general in the Indo-Pacific region has highlighted the value of “boxes of rockets” hiding in plain sight as part of a broader strategy that “gives our adversary pause.”\n\nAs for the launcher seen at Bragg, it is a prototype launch system developed as part of the Palletized Field Artillery Launcher (PFAL) project that is said to currently belong to U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). PFAL presents a harder-to-spot and otherwise flexible strike capability, especially for launching ballistic missiles, which could be of interest to the regular Army if the service is not pursuing something in this vein already.\n\nTWZwas the first to reporton the container with the launcher inside at Fort Bragg after spotting it in videos, one of which is seen below, of President Donald Trump’s visit to the base back in June. Bragg is the Army’s main special operations hub, and is also home to the 82nd Airborne Division, among other units.\n\nPresident Trump arrives at the Holland Drop Zone—Fort Bragg…pic.twitter.com\/VQrOWoyata\n\n— Dan Scavino (@Scavino47)June 10, 2025\n\nLast year,Military Timesalso published a very brief video of the PFAL, seen below, but did not name the launcher and provided no further details.\n\nThis is “the Palletized Field Artillery Launcher or PFAL. These are prototype launcher platforms owned by SOCOM,” Darrell Ames, an Army spokesperson, toldTWZ. “This is not MLRS and the platform in the picture is not fielded to the Army. The prototype does launch the current MLRS family of munitions [MFOM] with the exception of PrSM.”\n\nMFOM currently includes 227mm guided artillery rockets, as well as anArmy Tactical Missile System(ATACMS) andPrecision Strike Missile(PrSM) short-range ballistic missiles, the latter of which the Army isin the process of fielding now. All the munitions come in standardized ‘pods’ that can each hold six rockets, a single ATACMS, or two PrSMs. The PFAL launcher can accommodate two of these pods at once.\n\nCurrent-generation 227mm artillery rockets in the Army’s inventory have a maximum range of some 50 miles (around 80 kilometers), and extended-range types that can reach out to just over 93 miles (150 kilometers) are now in production. The longest-range variant of the ATACMS short-range ballistic missile in Army service today can fly out to 186 miles (300 kilometers). The baseline version of PrSM has a demonstrated range of 310 miles (500 kilometers), but the Army is already lookingat multiple future versionswith greater reach.\n\nPFAL dates to at least 2020 and directly evolved from a demonstration program called Strike X, which the Pentagon’sStrategic Capabilities Office(SCO) had run. Strike X also included work on potential upgrades for ATACMS, including a seeker that would enable the missile tohit moving targets on land or at sea, a capabilitynow in development for PrSM.\n\nSince its creation in 2012, SCO has been focused on advanced and otherwise novel development efforts, often leveraging existing platforms and munitions. Prime examples arethe Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) effortthat led tothe B-21 Raiderstealth andthe transformationofthe SM-6 surface-to-air missileinto amulti-purpose weapon able to also strike targetson land and at sea. SM-6 has nowfurther evolved into an air-to-air missile, as well.\n\n“PFAL is a palletized erectable launcher that provides alternatives to deliver near-term innovative long-range strike capabilities to improve operational effectiveness for Combatant Commanders,” according topast Army budget documents. “The PFAL launcher is capable of firing from a fixed ground position, Palletized Load System (PLS) trailer, or maritime vessel.”\n\nThe budget documents also say the intent, at least, was to eventually certify the PFAL to fire PrSM.\n\nThe only funding the Army looks to have requested and received for the PFAL effort was $20.175 million that came in Fiscal Year 2021. Last year, the service said it hadleveraged work on PFAL in the developmentof an uncrewed derivative of the HIMARS launcher vehicle called theAutonomous Multi-domain Launcher(AML). Unlike HIMARS, AML can be loaded with two MFOM pods at once rather than just one. The M270 MLRS is also a two-pod launcher.\n\nWhen SOCOM acquired its prototype PFALs, and what its plans for those launchers are currently, are unclear. Explicit mention of the system does not appear to be present in any of the command’s budget documentation.TWZhas reached out for more information.\n\nGenerally speaking, asTWZnoted in our initial reporting on what is known to be a PFAL prototype:\n\n“Being able to launch this array of rockets and missiles already gives M270 and M142 immense flexibility. A containerized launcher would open up additional possibilities, including the ability to turn any truck that can carry a standard shipping container into a platform capable of firing long-range guided rockets and missiles. This, in turn, could help the Army more readily expand its available launch capacity as required.”\n\n“The containerized launchers could also be deployed in a fixed mode, offering forward operating bases the ability to hold targets at risk dozens, if not hundreds, of miles away. This can include providing an on-call form of organic air\/fire support for troops operating far from the forward base. The launcher inside the container cannot traverse laterally, but an array of them could be positioned in such a way to provide maximum coverage in all directions.”\n\n“Being a container-based design, whether deployed in a truck-mounted or fixed configuration, they would be readily relocatable from one location to another. The containerized launchers could also be loaded on rail cars and\/or employed from ships with sufficient open deck space.”\n\n“In any of these modes, the launcher would benefit from its unassuming outward appearance. This would present challenges for opponents when it comes to detection and targeting, since any container could potentially be loaded with rockets or ballistic missiles.”\n\nTrump’s visit to Fort Bragg in June, where the PFAL made its appearance, also came just over a week after Ukrainian forces had demonstrated the value of concealed launch capabilities, in general, with the unprecedented covert drone attacks on multiple Russian air bases. Several other countries,including Russia,China, andIran, have also been developing launchers for artillery rockets and\/or missiles concealed inside shipping containers.\n\nAll of this underscores the potential interest that SOCOM, specifically, might have in the capabilities that a containerized system like PFAL has to offer, coupled with its discreet appearance. The idea of special operations rocket artillery may appear unusual at first glance. However, regular Army HIMARS units, in particular, have been an important supporting asset for forward-deployed special operations forces for years now,especially in Syria. Special operators are also known to have made use of HIMARS batteries to execute targeted strikes onhigh-value individuals or groups thereofin Afghanistan.\n\nThe explicit mention in the past Army budget documents of potentially employing PFAL from a “maritime vessel” is also especially interesting to consider in the context of special operations missions. Special operations forces regularly operate fromsea base shipsandother types with open deck spacefor containerized capabilities. This includesthe secretiveOcean Trader, itself designed to have an outwardly civilian-looking appearance to aid in its use as an unassuming launch platform for covert and clandestine operations.\n\nPFALs, or a similar design, could be employed by regular ground units in support of non-special operations missions, as well. It could also give any ship with sufficient deck space an add-on precision strike capability.\n\nWhile the current status of the PFAL project is unclear, there are clear indications that the Army remains actively interested in a launcher that can be concealed among standard shipping containers for the same general reasons stated earlier in this story. Containerized launchers could be particularly relevant in future expeditionary or distributed operations, especially across the broad expanses of the Pacific during a future major conflict with China, or for trying to deter one.\n\n“I think, again, it aligns to our ability to operate in multiple domains,” Army Gen. Ronald Clark, head of U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC), said in response to a question about containerized launch capabilitiesat an eventthat the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) think tank in Washington, D.C., hosted on June 27. “Our ability to target our adversaries at scale and our ability to be able to be literally ubiquitous with boxes of rockets at different places, that look like boxes of something else, really gives our adversary pause, because it’s in real time providing deterrence.”\n\nThat same day, the Army put out a contracting notice outlininga potential family of uncrewed launcher vehicles, building on the prototype AML. The Common AML (CAML) ‘system of systems’ might include a ‘heavy’ type based on the 10×10M1075 Palletized Loading System(PLS) truck, which in turn could point to plans for a new containerized launcher. The CAML-H would be designed to fire munitions beyond the ones that come in MFOM pods, includingTomahawk land-attack cruise missilesand Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) surface-to-air missiles.\n\nIt is also worth noting here that the Army is already fielding the Typhon missile system, which includes tractor-trailer launchers capable offiring Tomahawks and SM-6s. The Army has been looking at smaller launchers that are easier to deploy as companions to Typhon. Typhon’s existing launchers have a containerized design, but do not have the outward look of an unmodified shipping container like PFAL.\n\nOther services might be interested in the capabilities that PFAL, or a further development of that design, offers. The Navy does alreadyhave its own containerized launchersforfiring Tomahawks and SM-6sthat are extremely similar, but not identical to the Army’s Typhon design. The U.S. Marine Corps also justrecently announced its intention to axea planned ground-based Tomahawk cruise missile capability in its latest budget request. The Marines made the decision after determining that the complete Long Range Fires (LRF) system, which includes uncrewed launcher vehicles derived from the 4×4Joint Light Tactical Vehicle(JLTV), could not be effectively used as part of its new expeditionary and distributed concepts of operations.\n\nIf nothing else, SOCOM still has at least one PFAL in its inventory sitting at Fort Bragg.\n\nHoward Altman contributed to this story.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "News_title":"Is Fashion Ready for Climate ‘Crunch Time’?",
    "News_text":"“We are playing Russian roulette with our planet,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned at the American Natural History Museum in New York City last month, citing a World Meteorological Organization that predicted even more record-breaking temperatures over the next five years. “We need an exit ramp off the highway to climate hell.”\n\nThe traffic metaphor could not have been more apt. With extreme heat currently gripping vast swathes of the United States and Europe, subjecting tens of millions of people to dangerous temperatures far above what is usual for this time of year, even Germany’s famed autobahn is buckling under the strain, requiring emergency repairs. Over in Greece, mandatory work breaks have been imposed in parts of the country where temperatures are expected to exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit. On Monday, scientists said that the Fourth of July flash floods in Texas that killed at least 100 people—27 of them children and counselors from a summer camp—were caused by “very exceptional meteorological conditions” that could not be explained by natural variability alone.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n\nAre Unionized Garment Factories Being Targeted for Closures?\n\nLong Excluded in Climate Conversations, Fashion's Suppliers Create Own Seat at Table\n\nEcuador Apologizes to Abused Abacaleros, Plantation Remains Silent\n\nIf humanity still has “control of the wheel,” as Guterres said, it may not be for long. Despite having “what we need to save ourselves,” he said, referring to technologies that can slash emissions and protections that can safeguard carbon-absorbing forests, wetlands and oceans, “the battle to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees will be won or lost in the 2020s—under the watch of leaders today.” The global financial system must be part of the climate solution, too, he added. Right now, for every dollar needed to adapt to extreme weather, only roughly five cents is available.\n\nFashion, a trillion-dollar industry, could also be accused ofdistracted drivingunder these conditions. While major brands such as Adidas, H&M Group, Lululemon, Zara owner Inditex andeven Sheinshow “promising signs of improvement” in their climate strategies, even raising their ambitions, according to a sectorial deep dive by the NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch in June, their credibility is being thwarted by limited transparency on implementation plans, a reliance on problematic substitutions and a failure to shift completely away from the fast fashion business model.\n\n“You can’t only set targets,” said Benja Faecks, expert on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch, which is based in Brussels. “You also need to substantiate them with measures. For the fashion sector, one of the biggest things is that you need to electrify your supply chain. And while all the companies are talking about how renewable energy is needed, there’s almost no talk about how other processes that are not yet electrified need to be electrified.”\n\nAmong those so-called “false solutions,” the report said, is replacing coal withbiomass as a power source. Companies like H&M and Inditex say they are sourcing biomass with the lowest risk of adverse impact to help bridge efforts where barriers such as unreliable grid connections make transitioning to renewable energy difficult. Faecks said, however, that doing so doesn’t substantially reduce emissions and, instead, risks locking in carbon-intensive technologies.Unbundled, stand-alone renewable energy certificates, or RECs, are another problem. Two decades of REC procurement, meant to help finance new renewable energy projects, have mostly failed to create additional capacity on the grid, creating a “misleading narrative” about progress, she added.\n\nFaecks said that it’s the same with overproduction. Despite increasing industry chatter about the need to curtail the constant churn, no company has set measurable targets to do so. Rather than changing tack, Faecks said, businesses are still leaning on overproduction as a default strategy, creating tens of millions of metric tons of textile waste every year as a direct consequence. There’s a climate corollary, too: One 2020 McKinsey study estimated that reducing the quantity of pre-consumer unsold clothing by 10 percent through more eﬃcient supply chains and more accurate forecasting tools could reduce industry-wide emissions by 9 percent by 2030. It’s why the French legislature is embracing new rules that could regulate fast fashion’seven speedier counterpart, emblematized by Shein.\n\n“And it’s not only for household brands like H&M and Inditex, but also for Gucci, Prada and the higher-value brands that are overstimulating customer demands,” Faecks said. “So I think we need a rethinking of what fashion is, and how we can go from cradle to grave without exceeding planetary boundaries.”\n\nOther key transitions listed by the NewClimate Institute and Carbon Watch report—lower-impact fibers and low-emission logistics—have likewise seen middling progress, though not to the extent that they could be accurately referred to as “transitions,” she said.\n\nA more recent McKinsey study found that nearly two-thirds of clothing and footwear purveyors are behind on their 2030 decarbonization goals, with many shunting sustainability down their list of priorities and scaling back their commitments by pushing back or rescinding their net-zero targets. Only 18 percent of fashion executives ranked sustainability as a top-three risk to growth in 2025 versus 29 percent in 2024, it noted.\n\nGlobal Fashion Agenda CEO Federica Marchionni alluded to this at theGlobal Fashion Summit in Copenhagenlast month, where she said that the only certainty in an uncertain world is and will be climate change. But the cold calculus is that companies, ponying up more for, say, the Trump White House’s increased tariffs, will see thinner profit margins with less wiggle room for long-term investments bearing less tangible returns.\n\n“As we adapt, countries and communities must be supported to respond to current and future climate change impacts,” she said. “As fashion is contributing to the climate crisis, too, it must not only mitigate its environmental impact but also support value chain adaptation to build long-term resilience.”\n\nIt’s not only brands that bear responsibility, Faecks said, but also standard setters such as the GHG Protocol and the Science Based Targets initiative, which could require transition alignment targets to better shepherd companies. Regulatory interventions are similarly crucial because otherwise companies would only be guided by voluntary initiatives.\n\nOne problem, she said, is that there’s too much finger-pointing about who’s to blame for the current predicament and too little seizing of the reins. This phenomenon could worsen as companies face more existential issues—immediate-term financial health, for one—amid proliferating economic and geopolitical challenges that make the material risks of global warming feel, well, less material.\n\n“You could also say that it’s the consumer’s responsibility to demand fewer clothes,” she said. “So I think instead of shifting the blame, it’s important to take leadership. Brands do have a role to play in engaging their suppliers. There are whole policy papers on how supplier engagement should work and should be encouraged. But without real frameworks and regulations, this game of blaming will continue.”\n\nIf fashion’s climate plans are riddled with half measures, there’s at least one area with a massively missing element: its workers. A June report by the Business & Human Rights Resource Center, which is headquartered in London and New York, found that while more than half of the 65 brands it examined have made commitments to reduce supply chain emissions by 2030, not one target involves engaging with or mitigating the impact on workers. Of the seven companies with the most ambitious climate goals, just one—Inditex—has a public climate transition plan that mentions workers. This despite the fact that climate breakdown willdisproportionately impactgarment-producing hubs in the global South.\n\nThat no brand has laid out a stand-alone “just transition” policy—defined by the United Nations as “leaving no person or country behind”—came as a surprise to Natalie Swan, labor rights program manager at BHRRC. She had assumed, going in, that it would have been an overutilized term, considering how often it’s bandied about.\n\n“I don’t think that it is acceptable for a fashion company, or any business for that matter, to have ambitious decarbonization targets and not link workers intrinsically to a just transition,” she said. “There is shared prosperity around this: there are rights holders along supply chains who are making the clothes that brands are selling, who absolutely have skin in the game on what a transition looks like.”\n\nNot mentioning workers beyond a throwaway line about engaging with stakeholders is a “wilful omission,” she said.  Speaking to workers in Bangladesh and Cambodia, it was clear to her that they understand the climate emergency and the implications thereof, including how the growing use of new technologies or machinery could dramatically alter their employment landscape without reskilling or upskilling support.\n\n“Their expertise was absolutely palpable on what the impact of heat was in factories, what they needed to feel safe at work and at home, and what they saw as the vision for a genuinely ‘green’ factory, rather than just an LEED-certified one,” Swan said.Existing heat standardsfor workplaces are vague, pithy, non-existent or subject to lax oversight regimes that render any modicum of guidance just a hair’s breadth above meaningless.\n\nWorkers are also the onesbearing the bruntof extreme heat and flooding that can create operational disruptions and drive respiratory illnesses, cardiac issues and infectious diseases. Between March and April, for instance, members of the Tamil Nadu Textile and Common Labour Union reported temperatures between 95 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit in garment factories across the South Indian state, or far above what a human body can reasonably tolerate under industrial conditions. If brands propel the transition with the current status quo of supply chain inequality “baked in,” they will only perpetuate the “unjust and self-defeating” power differential that undergirds current production systems by ignoring the people on the frontlines, she added.\n\n“There is an opportunity—a business opportunity—to have a shared agenda and vision for what the future of fashion means,” Swan said. “It’s an absolute requirement because these rights holders will be at increased risk if international brands don’t engage with workers and their representatives. They’re not outside their business models. They’re within and critical to their business models.”\n\nEven “stakeholder engagement” can mean very different things to different people. Swan broke it down: “Does it mean utilizing worker voice technology? Does it mean having a conversation with a few individual workers along your supply chain? Does it mean having a conversation with participation committees that do not make up stakeholder engagement, particularly when you do have the ability to have unionized workforce forces along your supply chains?”\n\nWriting in an article that BHRRC published last month, labor campaigners Nandita Shivakumar and Apekshita Varshney recounted how one factory employee told them that brands are writing their sustainability policies in air-conditioned rooms at 68 degrees Fahrenheit for people working in 104-degree Fahrenheit heat. Workers aren’t asking for luxuries, they said, just the “bare minimum to survive,” such as cold drinking water, a functioning fan for every five to 10 people and clean bathrooms to rinse off their sweat.\n\n“The cost of meeting these needs is negligible,” they wrote. “The question is not about affordability: it’s about willingness.” Brands, investors and multi-stakeholder initiatives, they said, must recognize heat stress as a human rights issue and incorporate it into human rights due diligence, occupational safety and climate adaptation plans. Equally important, they must share the financial burden of adaptation by funding infrastructure improvements, particularly for low-margin suppliers.\n\nBack in New York City, Guterres described the present as the “moment of truth” for climate action. Because every fraction of a degree of global heating counts, amounting to the “difference between minimizing climate chaos or crossing dangerous tipping points,” now is the time to mobilize, act and deliver, he said.\n\n“Our planet is trying to tell us something, but we don’t seem to be listening,” Guterres said. “It’s climate crunch time. The need for action is unprecedented but so is the opportunity—not just to deliver on climate, but on economic prosperity and sustainable development.”",

    "News_title":"Former Chicago Ald. Edward Burke released early from federal prison",
    "News_text":"Less than 10 months after reporting to federal prison, former Chicago Ald. Edward Burke on Tuesday was released early to spend the rest of his sentence in the Chicago area, according to federal officials.\n\nIn late September, Burke, 81, had checked himself into the low-security federal prison camp at Thomson, Illinois, tostart a two-year sentence on his corruption case. It was an ignominious moment for a onetime city leader who had wielded power for decades as the city’s longest-serving alderman.\n\nBut Burke apparently qualified to leave the facility early due to his age. The camp, which houses about 133 male inmates, is situated about 2 ½ hours west of Chicago, along the Mississippi River.\n\nIn a statement, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said Burke was transferred from the camp to community confinement, which is overseen by federal authorities in the Chicago area. Community confinement can be served either at home or in a residential reentry facility, the statement said.\n\nBurke’s projected release from community confinement is Feb. 20 of next year, officials said.\n\nMost federal inmates are required to serve 85% of their sentences, which originally would have seen Burke released in May 2026 at age 82.\n\nBurke lawyers Joseph Duffy and Charles Sklarsky were not immediately available to comment on the release.\n\nBurke is expected to serve a year on court-ordered supervision. He also was to pay $65,000 in restitution to the owners of the Burger King franchise he was convicted of shaking down, as well as a $2 million fine imposed by U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall.\n\nBurke, one of the last vestiges of the old Democratic political machine, was convicted by a jury in December 2023 of racketeering conspiracy, bribery and attempted extortion in a series of schemes to use his considerable City Hall clout to try to win business from developers for his private property tax law firm.\n\nAmong them were efforts to woo the New York-based developers of the $600 million renovation of the Old Post Office, extorting the Texas owners of the Burger King, who were seeking to renovate a restaurant in Burke’s 14th Ward, and intervening on behalf of a developer in Portage Park who wanted help getting the pole sign approved for a new Binny’s Beverage Depot location.\n\nEven in a state that has seen countless politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, handed prison terms for corruption, Burke has been among the most influential.

Mayor Brandon Johnson was asked about it at a news conference on another topic.\n\n“What I can say is that it is critical, though, that public servants, adhere and maintain … that every day that we have to work to earn the public’s trust,” said Johnson, who was asked about the precedent the early release could set.\n\n“To your question about the precedent, there’s no secret that the city of Chicago, the county of Cook, state of Illinois, has had its share of public servants letting the residents down,” the mayor said. “I’m just going to be hopeful that whatever the circumstances around how his sentence is being carried out … (it sends) the message, a strong message that (if you’re) violating the public trust, that you will be held accountable.”\n\nIn addition to the time behind bars, Kendall ordered the $2 million fine, finding that financial penalties for politicians who engage in corruption should be far higher and noting the money will go to help victims of crime in which the defendants are not as wealthy as Burke.\n\n“I think that really does send a message, if you want to commit public corruption by being greedy, then the disgorgement of your own funds will go toward the people,” Kendall said.\n\nBefore he was sentenced, Burke read an uncharacteristically brief statement to the court, saying he’d been blessed with a long career and was sorry to “see it end like this.” Then he asked the judge for mercy.\n\n“Whatever amount of time God has decided to leave me on this earth, I’d like to spend as much of it as possible with my devoted wife, my wonderful children and grandchildren,” Burke said.\n\nThe Thomson prison was not Burke’s first choice of places to serve out his sentence.

    "News_title":"Former Chicago Ald. Edward Burke’s release from federal prison expected Tuesday",
    "News_text":"CHICAGO — Less than 10 months after reporting to federal prison, Edward Burke was expected to begin spending the rest of his sentence in the Chicago area Tuesday, according to sources close to the once-powerful alderman who have knowledge of the matter.\n\nBurke was expected to report to a halfway house as soon as midday. It was not clear whether he would be there long before being placed on home confinement, sources said.\n\nBurke, 81, had checked himself into the low security federal prison camp at Thomson, Illinois, in late September to start a two-year sentence on his corruption case. It was an ignominious moment for a onetime city leader who had wielded power for decades as the city’s longest-serving alderman.\n\nThe camp, which houses about 133 male inmates, is situated about 2 1\/2 hours’ drive west of Chicago, along the Mississippi River. His original release date was expected to be in the first half of next year, but he apparently qualified to leave the facility early due to his age.\n\nMost federal inmates are required to serve 85% of their sentences, which originally would have seen Burke released in May 2026 at age 82.\n\nBurke lawyer Charles Sklarsky could not immediately be reached for comment on the imminent release.\n\nBurke is expected to serve a year on court-ordered supervision. He also was to pay $65,000 in restitution to the owners of the Burger King franchise he was convicted of shaking down, as well as a $2 million fine imposed by U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall.\n\nBurke, one of the last vestiges of the old Democratic political machine, was convicted by a jury in December of racketeering conspiracy, bribery and attempted extortion in a series of schemes to use his considerable City Hall clout to try and win business from developers for his private property tax law firm.\n\nAmong them were efforts to woo the New York-based developers of the $600 million renovation of the Old Post Office, extorting the Texas owners of the Burger King, who were seeking to renovate a restaurant in Burke’s 14th Ward, and intervening on behalf of a developer in Portage Park who wanted help getting the pole sign approved for a new Binny’s Beverage Depot location.\n\nEven in a state that has seen countless politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, handed prison terms for corruption, Burke has been among the most influential. The head of the vaunted Finance Committee, Burke not only worked the city’s purse strings but also was a shrewd ward boss, political tactician and judicial slate-maker.\n\nKendall had ordered a relatively light prison term for Burke, citing the dozens of letters she received from citizens of all walks of life extolling Burke’s acts of kindness and charity, even when they had nothing to do with his role as alderman.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing last June, Kendall said that the comparatively limited period of criminal conduct for which Burke was convicted at trial does not wipe away those decades of good works.\n\nShe also criticized the U.S. attorney’s office for its unprecedented deferred prosecution agreement with former Ald.

    "News_title":"US Supreme Court lifts order that blocked Trump's mass federal layoffs",
    "News_text":"By John Kruzel\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way on Tuesday for President Donald Trump's administration to resume carrying out mass job cuts and the restructuring of agencies, elements of his campaign to downsize and reshape the federal government.\n\nThe justices lifted San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Susan Illston's May 22 order that had blocked large-scale federal layoffs called \"reductions in force\" affecting potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs, while litigation in the case proceeds.\n\nTrump in February announced \"a critical transformation of the federal bureaucracy\" in an executive order directing agencies to prepare for a government overhaul aimed at significantly reducing the federal workforce and gutting offices and programs opposed by the administration.\n\nWorkforce reductions were planned at the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, State, Treasury, Veterans Affairs and more than a dozen other agencies.\n\nIllston wrote in her ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering the downsizing, siding with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments that challenged the administration.\n\n\"As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,\" Illston wrote.\n\nThe judge blocked the agencies from carrying out mass layoffs and limited their ability to cut or overhaul federal programs. Illston also ordered the reinstatement of workers who had lost their jobs, though she delayed implementing this portion of her ruling while the appeals process plays out.\n\nIllston's ruling was the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul being pursued by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, a key player in the Republican president's drive to slash the federal workforce.\n\nFormerly spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, DOGE has sought to eliminate federal jobs, shrink and reshape the U.S. government and root out what they see as wasteful spending. Musk formally ended his government work on May 30 and subsequently had a public falling out with Trump.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling on May 30 denied the administration's request to halt the judge's ruling.\n\nThe 9th Circuit said the administration had not shown that it would suffer an irreparable injury if the judge's order remained in place and that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in their lawsuit.\n\n\"The executive order at issue here far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution,\" the 9th Circuit wrote, calling the administration's actions \"an unprecedented attempted restructuring of the federal government and its operations.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit's ruling prompted the Justice Department's June 2 emergency request to the Supreme Court to halt Illston's order.\n\nControlling the personnel of federal agencies \"lies at the heartland\" of the president's executive branch authority, the Justice Department said in its filing to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The Constitution does not erect a presumption against presidential control of agency staffing, and the president does not need special permission from Congress to exercise core Article II powers,\" the filing said, referring to the constitution's section delineating presidential authority.\n\nThe plaintiffs urged the Supreme Court to deny the Justice Department's request. Allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its \"breakneck reorganization,\" they wrote, would mean that \"programs, offices and functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court in recent months has sided with Trump in some major cases that were acted upon on an emergency basis since he returned to office in January.\n\nIt cleared the way for Trump's administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they could face. In two cases, it let the administration end temporary legal status previously granted on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.\n\nIt also allowed Trump to implement his ban on transgender people in the U.S. military, blocked a judge's order for the administration to rehire thousands of fired employees and twice sided with his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Will Dunham)",

    "News_text":"By John Kruzel, Nandita Bose and Tim Reid\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way forDonald Trump's administration to pursue mass government job cuts and the sweeping downsizing of numerous agencies, a decision that could lead to tens of thousands of layoffs while dramatically reshaping the federal bureaucracy.\n\nTuesday's ruling stemmed from an executive order Trump issued in February ordering agencies to prepare for mass layoffs. At Trump's direction, the administration has come up with plans to reduce staff at the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human Services, State, Treasury, Veterans Affairs and more than a dozen other agencies.\n\nIn a brief unsigned order, the court said the Trump administration was \"likely to succeed\" in its argument that his directives were legally within his power.\n\nThe decision is the latest win for Trump's broader efforts to consolidate power in the executive branch. The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in several cases on an emergency basis since he returned to office in January, including clearing the way for implementation of some of his hardlineimmigrationpolicies.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday lifted San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Susan Illston's order in May that temporarily blocked large-scale federal layoffs while the case proceeded.\n\nIllston had ruled that Trump exceeded his authority in ordering the government downsizing without consulting Congress, which created and funded the agencies in question.\n\n\"As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,\" Illston wrote.\n\nWhile Tuesday's decision cleared one major legal obstacle for the White House, the court noted that it was not assessing the legality of any specific layoff plans at federal agencies.\n\nThose layoff proposals, some of which were submitted earlier this year, could still face legal challenges on a variety of grounds, including union opposition, statutory restrictions and civil service protections.\n\nThe White House said in a statement that the decision is a \"definitive victory for the president and his administration\" that reinforced Trump's authority to implement \"efficiency across the federal government.\"\n\nHowever, two White House sources familiar with the matter, who asked to remain unidentified, said the ruling did not permit agencies to execute layoffs immediately. One of the sources said additional delays or legal hurdles \"could alter the scope and timing of the cuts.\"\n\nA group of unions, nonprofits and local governments that sued to block the administration's mass layoffs said the ruling \"dealt a serious blow to our democracy and puts services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy\" and vowed to continue fighting as the case proceeds.\n\nThe plaintiffs had warned in court filings that Trump's plans, if allowed to proceed, would result in hundreds of thousands of layoffs.\n\nA Reuters\/Ipsos poll in April found that Americans narrowly favored Trump's campaign to downsize the federal government, with about 56% saying they supported the effort and 40% opposed. Their views broke down along party lines, with 89% of Republicans but just 26% of Democrats supportive.\n\nSome agencies whose downsizing plans had been put on hold said they would resume advancing those efforts.\n\n\"We will continue to move forward with our historic reorganization plan,\" the State Department, which has proposed laying off nearly 2,000 employees, said on X.\n\nDOGE CUTS\n\nUpon taking office in January, Trump launched a massive campaign to cut the 2.3-million strong federal civilian workforce, led by billionaireElon Muskand his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMusk and his mostly young lieutenants immediately moved into key government agencies, fired workers, gained access to governmentcomputer systemsand virtually shuttered two agencies – the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nTrump and Musk said the bloated federal bureaucracy needed to be downsized. Federal workers' unions and most Democrats say the cuts so far, and the plans for further mass layoffs, have been carried out haphazardly, leading to chaos inside many agencies and threatening important public services such as the processing of Social Security claims.\n\nBy late April, about 100 days into the effort, the government overhaul had resulted in the firing, resignations and early retirements of 260,000 civil servants, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nLiberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole member of the nine-person court to publicly dissent from Tuesday's decision, criticizing the \"court's demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this president's legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.\"\n\nTuesday's decision extended Trump's winning record at the Supreme Court since taking office. The court has let Trump's administration resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they could face and end temporary legal status previously granted on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.\n\nIn addition, it has allowed Trump to implement his ban on transgender people in the U.S. military, blocked a judge's order that the administration rehire thousands of fired employees and curbed the power of federal judges to impose nationwide rulings impeding presidential policies.\n\nMost of these decisions have been issued as emergency orders, known colloquially as the shadow docket, that respond to applications for immediate action from the court.\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel and Nandita Bose; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung, Courtney Rozen, Tim Reid and Nichola Groom; Writing by Joseph Ax; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Cynthia Osterman and Christian Schmollinger)",

    "News_title":"Texas flood rescue teams continue search for missing as death toll climbs",
    "News_text":"More than 130 people have been confirmed deadafter flash floods devastated Central Texasin the early morning of July 4, according to local officials and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The search for more than 160 people still missing was disrupted over the weekend byanother round of rain and flooding.\n\nThe catastrophicJuly 4 stormcaused the Guadalupe River to swell to near-unprecedented levels. More than 100 of those killed, and most of those missing, were in Kerr County, which bore the brunt of the disaster in the flood-prone Texas Hill Country west of Austin, the state capital.\n\nPresident Trump signed a federal disaster declaration at Abbott's request, allowing theFederal Emergency Management Agencyto deploy its own teams to support local rescue and recovery efforts as those operations press on. More storms after the initial flooding made efforts especially challenging, officials said.\n\nOn Friday, July 11, one week after the disaster struck, Mr. Trumparrived in the regionto meet with officials, rescue workers and the families of victims.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it, a little narrow river that becomes a monster, and that's what happened,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the first lady and I are here in Texas to express the love and support and the anguish of our entire nation in the aftermath of this really horrific and deadly flood.\"\n\nCamp Mystic tragedy\n\nA largemajority of the flooding deathsoccurred in Kerr County, where officials have confirmed at least 106 people died.\n\nAt Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp with cabins along the river in a rural part of Kerr County near Hunt,at least 27 campers and counselorsdied in what the camp described as \"catastrophic flooding.\" Some survivors said they woke up to water rushing through the windows.\n\nKerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said Wednesday that crews continued to search for five missing campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic.\n\nOne child not associated with the camp is also missing, Abbott said Tuesday.\n\nHundreds of rescuers, including teams from local, state and federal agencies, as well as volunteers, are involved in the search, Texas Game Warden Ben Baker said Tuesday during a news conference.\n\n\"It's very tragic whenever you see human life. But to see a child in that loss of life, is extremely tragic,\" Baker told a reporter who had asked about the impacts on rescuers' mental health.\n\nAbbott said Tuesday he received a text message from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that said the Department of Health and Human Services is set to declare a public health emergency for the Texas Hill Country flash floods.\n\n\"This will make it easier for health care and mental health providers from out of state to help both by traveling to the area and by telemedicine,\" Abbott said the message read.\n\n26 feet of water rose from Guadalupe River\n\nFriday, July 4, was the last time a missing person was found alive in Kerr County, according to authorities. But search crews continued to surveymiles of the Guadalupe Riverin the hope of locating others who may have been lost in the floods that inundated Kerr County, Baker told reporters.\n\nThe river runs for approximately 230 miles through a region that sits between Austin and San Antonio, starting in Kerr County and ending along the Gulf Coast. It'snicknamed \"Flash Flood Alley\"because the terrain makes it vulnerable to inundation.\n\nOfficials in five other Texas counties have also confirmed deaths in the flooding: Travis County, which includes Austin, as well as Burnet, Kendall, Williamson and Tom Green County.\n\nDuring the early hours of July 4, the Guadalupe River in Hunt, in Kerr County,rose to about 26 feet— roughly the height of a two-story building — over the course of just 45 minutes, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a news conference.\n\nCamp Mystic was \"horrendously ravaged,\" Abbott later wrote in a social media post after visiting the site. About 650 people were staying there, including around 550 children, according to inspection records released by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which were dated July 2 — just two days before the flood.\n\nAccording to the records, Camp Mystic had \"a written plan of procedures to be implemented in case of a disaster,\" which was \"posted in the camp's administrative on-site office.\" But exactly what the plan contained isn't clear. Unlike at least one other camp along the Guadalupe River whose employees spoke to The Associated Press, Camp Mystic did not evacuate to higher ground ahead of the floods.\n\nKerr County officials said Wednesday that evacuating from Hill Country is not always the best course of action during a storm, echoing an earlier statement released by a joint information center established in the wake of the floods, which said that disaster responses in the Hill Country terrain are complex.\n\nRural areas, like Hunt, are full of single-lane bridges known as \"low water crossings\" that easily flood and create scattered \"islands\" of land that are impassable, said Johnathan Lam of the police department in Kerrville, a city in Kerr County. Those same locations have inconsistent cell service and are hard to reach for first responders.\n\n\"In Hunt, Highway 39 crisscrosses the Guadalupe again and again and again,\" Lam said. \"And all of those low water crossings, when they flood, they create islands where you can't get in and you can't get out, trapping people in their homes, trapping people in their vehicles. And that's what happened on the morning of July 4.\"\n\nA makeshift crew consisting of two Kerville officers, an emergency room doctor and some volunteer firefighters did what they could to fulfill the duties of a robust response team for 13 hours that first day, until emergency workers in high-profile vehicles were able to reach them at around 5 p.m., Lam said.\n\nScrutiny over weather forecasts\n\nWhether communities in the path of the floodingreceived adequate warningshas been heavily scrutinized and is the subject of ongoing debate. Kerr County officials have largely declined to respond to reporters' inquiries on the matter during their daily news conferences.\n\nSome have questioned ifthe Trump administration's cuts earlier this year to the National Weather Serviceand its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, potentially prevented local forecast offices from sufficiently preparing the public for the extent of the flooding.\n\nMr. Trump and his team have repeatedly rejected any suggestions that federal firings impacted forecasting or emergency preparedness ahead of the floods.\n\nACBS News analysisfound that22 warningsfrom the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding, which used escalating language as time went on. But some local residents said they did not receive emergency alerts on their phones nor did they understand how serious the situation had truly become until it actually happened.\n\nThe San Antonio and San Angelo weather service offices issued warnings for the areas affected by flooding. Officials with the union representing National Weather Service workers told CBS News there are 23 meteorologists staffed between those offices, which together have 10 vacant positions.\n\nIn San Antonio, the office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a vital role that essentially liaises between forecasters and emergency management agencies in the region to plan how information about an extreme weather event will be disseminated to the public, and which steps to take to protect them.\n\nNim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his office received a forecast Wednesday that predicted several inches of rain, but \"the amount of rain that fell at this specific location was never in any of those forecasts.\"\n\nDalton Rice, the city manager for Kerrville, in Kerr County, said during the same briefing that the storm \"dumped more rain than what was forecasted.\"\n\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a news conference July 4 that the county does \"not have a warning system\" in place to alert the public about weather emergencies. County officials had previouslydiscussed a public alarm systembut did not proceed with it because of the cost. Former Kerr County commissioner Tom Moser told CBS News the county had applied for a grant in the past to build the system but the application was not approved.\n\n\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" Lt. Gov. Patrick said Monday, noting that the state could offer resources for Kerr County to implement a system. \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens. ... If there had been a siren, maybe that would have sparked people to say 'Oh, we have a massive disaster like five minutes away.'\"\n\nWhen asked about the emergency warnings on Tuesday, Abbott said everything would be discussed at the state Legislature session.\n\n\"We're going to address every aspect of this storm to make sure we're going to have in place the systems that are needed to prevent deadly flooding events like this in the future,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe board of the Upper Guadalupe River Authority had secured funding and a contract to begin developing a flood monitoring system for the area, with preliminary meetings about the project scheduled for mid-July, according to the joint information center set up since the floods. That project aims to create a \"centralized dashboard to support local flood monitoring and emergency response,\" a spokesperson for the center said in a statement to CBS News.\n\n\"While real-time streamflow and rainfall data are already available through various sources, this new tool will bring those datasets for Kerr County into one platform to enhance usability for emergency managers,\" the statement said, adding, \"This is not a public alert system, but a decision-support resource intended to complement existing infrastructure.\"\n\nSen.

    "News_title":"Pro-Cuomo super PAC still raising money as it looks to back ‘free-market candidate’ for mayor",
    "News_text":"NEW YORK — Fix the City,a super PACthat spent an unprecedented amount of money to boost Andrew Cuomo’s mayoral primary campaign, is continuing to raise cash despite his loss with an eye toward backing a “free-market candidate” in November’s general election, the Daily News has learned.\n\nThe PAC, which spent more than $22 million on ads and other messaging boosting Cuomo’s primary campaign, has taken in $300,000 in donations since the ex-governor’s stunning loss to socialist Zohran Mamdani in the June 24 Democratic mayoral primary.\n\nA rep for Fix the City said it has continued to accept cash since Cuomo’s loss because the PAC’s donor base has asked it to play a role in November’s general mayoral election, too. Specifically, the rep said there’s calls forthe PACto back “a free-market candidate” in the November race who has “the experience to govern effectively.”\n\nFix the City hasn’t decided on a specific candidate to back, however, or committed absolutely to get engaged in the general election.\n\n“Fix the City is currently assessing the evolving situation and has yet to decide what role it intends to play in the general election,” said spokeswoman Liz Benjamin.\n\nWord of the PAC’s continued operation comes asMamdani’s upset victoryhas set off a wave of anxiety among the city’s business leaders and centrist Democrats, who are scrambling to figure out a strategy to defeat him in November.\n\nSome wealthy New Yorkers have raised particular concern about Mamdani’s outspoken criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza and the viability of his plans to raise taxes on millionaires in order to fund proposals to expand subsidized childcare, make public buses free and freeze the rent for stabilized tenants.\n\nDespite losing the primary, Cuomo’s name will be on the November ballot on an independent line. However, his campaign says he is still evaluating whether to actually mount a genuine campaign after his bruising loss to Mamdani.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, who’s reeling from record low approval ratings and fundraising struggles amid fallout from his federal corruption indicment, will also run in November’s race as an independent. He didn’t run in the primary.\n\nDespite the cloud of controversies around him, Adams has endeared himself to some political powerplayers in the city since Mamdani’s victory, including former Cuomo supporters like billionaire hedge fund managerBill Ackman, who endorsed the incumbent for reelection last week.\n\nAckman and a number of other prominent billionaires, like former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, donated heavily to Fix the City during the primary campaign.\n\nPACs can by law raise and spend limitless amounts of money as long as they don’t coordinate with the candidates they support. PAC spending for Adams could have a significant impact, given that his campaign continues to be denied public matching funds due to his indictment.\n\nAmong the post-primary donations to Fix the City is a $100,000 contribution on July 3 from David Rosen, who works in the financial sector. Rosen could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAibff Inc., a financial services company, donated another $75,000 to Fix the City on June 30 and before that, AECOM, a tech firm, threw the PAC $125,000 on June 26.\n\nSpokespeople for Adams and Cuomo didn’t immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nAlso running in the general mayoral election are Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and independent Jim Walden.\n\nBoth Adams and Cuomo have called on each other to drop out of the race, but it doesn’t appear likely that either will.\n\n“He had his opportunity,” Adams said of Cuomo on Fox Business Tuesday morning. “Give me an opportunity. I’m going to win this race.”\n\nCuomo, though, has said the candidatewho polls the best in head-to-head matchups with Mamdanishould stay in the race while the other ones should drop out. So far, Cuomo has mustered the most support out of all the anti-Mamdani hopefuls.\n\nIf Cuomo and Adams both wage general election campaigns, Mamdani is likely to benefit. That’s because Cuomo and Adams both appeal to the same base of moderate Democrats.\n\nMamdani, a relatively inexperienced State Assembly member, defeated Cuomo by 12% in the primary, in part because he drove huge turnout among young voters.\n\n_____",

    "News_title":"Local leaders believe ‘equity’ focus of federal program may be behind loss of Emerald Trail funding",
    "News_text":"The future of the Emerald Trail project is now uncertain, and some local leaders believe the decision that put the project’s future into flux may have come down to one word in a federal grant program’s name: “Equity”.\n\nWhat would have been the largest influx of federal grant dollars in the city’s history…is now history.\n\n$147 million awarded to the City of Jacksonville to help complete the Emerald Trail through the Federal Highway Administration Neighborhood Access and Equity Program was slashed in the federal reconciliation bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on Friday.\n\n“Exhalation when we knew we were getting it, and I would now say majorly disappointed now that it’s been rescinded,” said Groundwork CEO Kay Ehas.\n\nEhas explained that while the funds had not been disbursed yet, they were expected to be used to build half of the 30-mile urban trail.\n\nThe project aims to connect neighborhoods, schools, parks, and more throughout the City of Jacksonville.\n\nThere is partial funding to move forward with two of the five impacted segments, but Ehas said state, local, and private dollars, along with other possible grants, will be needed to make up the difference.\n\n“The fact that we’re moving forward with the next two segments gives us time to figure out how to fund the rest of it,” said Ehas.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the loss of funding may impact the project’s 2031 completion date, but Mayor Donna Deegan said the city is already looking to reapply for new federal grants.\n\n“We are told we can reapply under an economic development grant, which we will work with our partners, Representatives Rutherford and Bean, to get done,” said Deegan.\n\nThe cuts to the federal grant program went beyond Jacksonville.\n\nNearly 80 projects across the country totaling $3.1 billion were nixed in President Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill”.\n\nEhas told Action News Jax the inclusion of the word “Equity” in the grant program’s title may have been the Achilles Heel that sealed its fate.\n\n“I think it did, but that’s my personal opinion,” said Ehas.\n\n[DOWNLOAD:Free Action News Jax app for alerts as news breaks]\n\nEhas said while she was extremely disappointed, she wasn’t completely surprised to hear the grant was axed.\n\n“With the election of the new President, I think we all were cautiously optimistic that we knew potentially something might happen. I think it’s unprecedented what’s happened,” said Ehas.\n\nCongressman John Rutherford (R-FL 5th District), who was supportive of the grant, said there are likely other opportunities to secure federal dollars for the Emerald Trail.\n\n“Because I think the project has got merit,” said Rutherford.\n\nHe also agreed the program’s title and the fact it was created as part of former President Joe Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act” likely didn’t do it any favors.\n\n“I think we need to rework the application. You know, I would stay away from neighborhood access and equity,” said Rutherford.\n\nBut he doesn’t expect any future grant award to be a one-stop-shop like the now-canceled grant would have been.\n\n“I don’t think we can afford all that at one time. I think piecemealing it may be the way to go,” said Rutherford.\n\nAnd Mayor Deegan acknowledged any new grant application will need to be reconfigured to reflect the change in priorities in the nation’s capital.\n\n“Because of this new priority for the new administration, we’re gonna have to rewrite that grant under a new program and try to go back and get those funds,” said Deegan.\n\nBoth Congressman Rutherford and Congressman Aaron Bean (R-FL 4th District) committed to help recoup the lost dollars.\n\n“The Emerald Trail project is designed to improve connectivity and boost Jacksonville’s economy. Despite the claw back of unspent funding, JTA’s vision is far from over,” Congressman Bean told Action News Jax in a statement.\n\n>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<\n\n[SIGN UP:Action News Jax Daily Headlines Newsletter]",

    "News_title":"Opinion | Why this group of medical professionals are taking RFK Jr. to court",
    "News_text":"A former patient recently sent me a message asking, “Did the government hide all the problems with vaccines for the last decade just to fatten up pharma’s profits and should I stop getting them-are they really necessary??” In light ofthe opioid crisis, which laid bare serious flaws in how government agencies and drug companies operate, the doubts she voiced are hardly surprising. What troubled me was that now thatRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading the Department of Health and Human Services, for the first time in the more than 15 years I’ve known her, my former patient has begun to question the benefit of vaccines.\n\nStories like hers are why America’s leading medical organizations took the extraordinary step Monday ofsuing their own government, including Kennedy and HHS.\n\nA coalition that includes the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American Public Health Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Massachusetts Public Health Alliance and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine is challenging Kennedy’s May directive removing Covid-19 vaccination recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization schedule. Kennedy made that decision without input from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the independent expert panel that has guided such decisions for decades.\n\nRichard Hughes, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said at a news conference Monday that the groups are “asking the court to order the secretary to announce on X that those immunization recommendations are now reinstated to the CDC immunization schedules.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filedin the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. AnHHS spokesperson told NPR in a statementthat “The Secretary stands by his CDC reforms.”\n\nObjections to Kennedy’s leadership aren’t based on mere procedural violations. Kennedy, who spent years promoting debunked theories that vaccines aren’t safe, is systematically dismantling evidence-based medicine and imperiling the public’s health. Kennedy’s decision tofire all 17 ACIP membersand install eight new members — several of them with anti-vaccine viewpoints — sends a chilling message to health care providers across America.\n\nWhat makes the current American situation particularly troubling is that Kennedy isn’t just changing policy; he’s attacking the very foundation of how medical decisions should be made. When physicians review immunization schedules with their patients, they’re not just following government recommendations; they’re drawing on decades of rigorous scientific research, peer review and expert consensus. Kennedy’s actions force physicians into an impossible position: follow federal guidance that contradicts established medical evidence or provide what they consider standard care while potentially facing insurance and regulatory complications.\n\nThe legal strategy employed by the medical organizations is particularly noteworthy. By alleging violations of theAdministrative Procedure Actand decrying what they call the arbitrary nature of Kennedy’s decisions, they’re establishing a framework that could protect scientific integrity across multiple health policy domains. This approach mirrorsinternational caseswheremedical organizations have successfully challengedgovernment overreach by emphasizing procedural protections and professional autonomy.\n\nWe shouldn’t need lawsuits to protect evidence-based medicine. The fact that America’s leading medical organizations feel compelled to take this unprecedented step speaks to how far we’ve strayed from the scientific principles that have guided public health policy for generations.\n\nDirect legal challenges by medical organizations against federal health officials are extraordinarily rare in American history. The foundational case remainsJacobson v. Massachusettsfrom 1905, which established the government’s authority to enforce vaccination during public health emergencies. Since then, the medical establishment and federal health agencies have largely worked in concert, with scientific evidence guiding policy decisions.\n\nAs the note I received from my former patient illustrates, the consequences of what Kennedy has been doing are already proving to be problematic. Social media is filled with questions and suggestions around vaccine travel from people who’ve been confused by mixed messages from federal authorities. Insurance companies have had to either reinforce coverage for vaccines removed from recommended schedules or remain silent in the absence of clear policy. Health care providers are struggling to maintain consistent messaging about preventive care, which diminishes the time available to address patients’ other concerns.\n\nThis extends far beyond vaccines. Kennedy’s broader assault on public health infrastructure — fromgutting CDC staff and data systemstosharing patient informationwith Immigration and Customs Enforcement — represents a fundamental threat to the trust that underpins effective health care delivery. When patients can’t trust that their government is providing evidence-based guidance, or that their private health information will be protected, the entire system suffers.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher. If Kennedy succeeds in politicizing vaccine policy, then what’s next? Will climate change denial influence environmental health regulations? Will political ideology override scientific evidence in drug approvals? The precedent being set threatens to undermine not just vaccination programs, but the entire edifice of evidence-based health care.\n\nAs physicians, we took an oath to “first, do no harm.” That obligation extends beyond individual patients to the broader public health. The medical organizations filing this lawsuit aren’t just defending vaccination policy; they’re defending the principle that health care decisions should be grounded in science, not politics.\n\nThe outcome of this case will determine whether American medicine can maintain its scientific integrity in the face of political pressure. For the sake of every patient I treat, I hope the courts recognize what’s at stake.\n\nThis article was originally published onMSNBC.com",

    "News_text":"KERRVILLE, Texas — Lucy Kennedy said it was about midnight when she woke up to the sound of thunder.\n\n“I couldn’t go back to sleep,” Lucy, 10, said Tuesday in an interview, her mother sitting by her side. “I just had a feeling that something really bad was about to happen.”\n\nLucy had been asleep Thursday night in her bunk at Camp Mystic, a roughly 750-person summer camp in Hunt. Rain had begun to pound an areaknown to be at severe risk of flash floods.\n\nOn“Here’s the Scoop,”podcast co-host Morgan Chesky takes listeners on the ground to hear from survivors of Texas’ catastrophic flooding.\n\nAs water began to inundate her campsite, girls from her cabin were told to grab blankets, pillows and water bottles and line up single file, Lucy said. They moved to the second floor of a rec hall for safety, where they sat in soaking wet pajamas before they migrated to a campsite on higher ground.\n\nIn the light of day, survivors were airlifted Friday to safety by helicopter — a sight Lucy said was “pretty, but also not pretty at the same time.”\n\n“Everything looked flooded and broken, so it was also kind of sad,” she said.\n\nAfter the helicopter ride, Lucy was shuttled to an elementary school where her mother, Wynne Kennedy, waited with other parents in the gym, hoping to hear their children’s names called out.\n\n“When I saw her, she was wrapped up in a blanket, had a teddy bear,” Wynne Kennedy said. “We just held each other tight, and I held her all night.”\n\nDays after floodwaters swept through Texas’ Hill Country, rescue workers continue to comb the region. More than 100 people are dead across six counties, and Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday that161 people are known to be missing. Few places, if any, were hit as hard as Camp Mystic, a private Christian summer camp for girls that has been around since 1926.\n\nAt least 27 attendees and counselors at Camp Mystic are either dead or missing. Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said Tuesday that five campers and a counselor are still unaccounted for.\n\nOn Tuesday, a sign that reads “Jesus Wept” was propped up on debris by the riverbanknext to the camp.\n\nOfficials in Kerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, said over the weekend that they were caught off guard by the onslaught of floodwaters, noting that parts of the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. But some crucial questions remain unanswered, particularly around whether adequate warnings were issued. At a news conference Tuesday, local authoritiesdodged questions about the local alert system.\n\nIn a statementon its website, Camp Mystic said it had been in communication with state and local authorities in efforts to find those still missing.\n\nWynne Kennedy, who used to work at the camp, said she felt her daughter “was in the safest place she could be because of the extensive flood evacuation plans that they trained us on.” Last week’s devastation felt unprecedented, she said, saying that “the water never got near any of those cabins, ever, before, when we would have a little flooding.”\n\nDestruction from the flooding was not contained to Camp Mystic. The Kennedys’ house in Kerrville was destroyed overnight. Doors were ripped from the hinges, a storage shed was swept away and a tree crashed into Lucy’s bedroom. Wynne Kennedy said the family was used to flash flooding in the area but could never have predicted the “wall of water” that washed over their home. The river, which could be seen sparkling on a sunny day from their kitchen, is now brown and filled with debris.\n\nShe said she is optimistic that it will sparkle again. And she looks forward to the reopening of Camp Mystic, which was due to celebrate its 100th anniversary next year.\n\n“We’re just trying to keep the spirit of Mystic alive,” Wynne Kennedy said.\n\nLucy recalled her favorite memories from camp over the last three years — horseback riding and fishing, the latter of which earned her a silver charm last year for her skills. Her favorite meal was the chef’s salad, she said, served Mondays for lunch.\n\nSummer camps can be familial traditions in Texas, with some familieshaving sent their children to Camp Mystic for generations.Wynne Kennedy’s mother was a camper and a grandmother was a counselor, she said. She described the other campers and their parents as a “big family.”\n\n“Unfortunately, I do have loved ones that have girls that are still missing or unaccounted for and loved ones who have lost their daughters,” Wynne Kennedy said, adding: “Some parents said things like, ‘They’ll be forever playing at their favorite place in the world, at Camp Mystic.’ And I think that is beautiful.”\n\nThis article was originally published onNBCNews.com",

    "News_text":"The Lord of the RingsdirectorPeter Jacksonis stepping into uncharted territory, but it is not Middle earth this time.\n\nThe Oscar-winning filmmaker has joined a groundbreaking project that aims to revive the South Island Giant Moa, an extinct bird native to New Zealand.\n\nIn an unprecedented collaboration with Māori leaders and cutting-edge scientists, Jackson is helping rewrite the future of wildlife conservation.\n\nIn a partnership that sounds like it belongs in one of his epic fantasy films, Jackson has teamed up with Colossal Biosciences and the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre to bring the massive, long-extinct moa back to life.\n\nThe South Island Giant Moa, which stood up to 12 feet tall, vanished hundreds of years ago.\n\nHowever, if this new alliance succeeds, it might once again roam the wild landscapes of New Zealand.\n\nColossal Biosciences, the same company leading efforts to revive the dire wolf, is providing advanced genetic engineering and computational technologies to make this dream a reality.\n\nBut it’s not just science powering this effort; it is deeply rooted in culture.\n\n“We are honored to contribute our advanced computational and genetic engineering capabilities under the direction of the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre,” Ben Lamm, CEO of Colossal Biosciences told The Blast. “This partnership represents a new model where Indigenous leadership guides scientific endeavors, recognizing that traditional ecological knowledge and cultural context are essential to responsible de-extinction and species preservation efforts. There is so much knowledge that will be unlocked and shared on the journey to bring back the iconic moa.”\n\nFor Jackson, the project is personal and powerful.\n\nKnown for showcasing the awe-inspiring natural beauty of New Zealand in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit,\" Jackson is now helping protect and restore that very environment.\n\n“I’m delighted to partner with the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre and Colossal Biosciences on a mission to save some of our most precious taonga,” Jackson said, using the Māori word for “treasures.”\n\nHe added, “With the recent resurrection of the dire wolf, Colossal has also made real the possibility of bringing back lost species. There’s a lot of science still to be done—but we can start looking forward to the day when birds like the moa... are rescued from the darkness of extinction. Exciting times lay ahead!”\n\nThe Ngāi Tahu Research Centre is leading the project with a vision that goes beyond revival.\n\nMāori families will participate in every phase, from genetics to habitat planning, ensuring their ancestral wisdom plays a central role in each decision.\n\nThis is more than just a de-extinction experiment; it’s a cultural renaissance.\n\nThe Ngāi Tahu Research Centre envisions the project as a springboard for creating opportunities in ecotourism, education, and conservation, all while celebrating Māori sovereignty and knowledge.\n\nFamilies from the Ngāi Tahu tribe will be involved in the scientific work while the surrounding communities prepare to welcome the moa back home.\n\nFrom building research facilities to restoring habitats, it’s a full-circle initiative that puts Indigenous leadership at the core of futuristic science.\n\nImagine visiting New Zealand and seeing a South Island Giant Moa stroll across the landscape, guided not just by lab data but by centuries of environmental stewardship.\n\nThat’s the vision Jackson, Ngāi Tahu, and Colossal Biosciences are turning into reality, one gene at a time.\n\nPeter Jackson may have been quiet on the film front, but the visionary director has now confirmed he is far from done with cinema.\n\nIn a recent interview withScreen Rant, Jackson shared an exciting update, revealing that he is currently developing three different screenplays.\n\n“No, no. I’m certainly not retired,” Jackson said when asked about his future in filmmaking. “We are currently working on three different screenplays. I'm at the moment writing three different scripts.”\n\nWhile he didn’t reveal specific details about these projects, Peter Jackson hinted at the return of one of \"The Lord of the Rings\"'s famous characters, Gollum, in \"The Hunt for Gollum.\"\n\nThe film is a \"Lord of the Rings\" continuation that Andy Serkis, who portrayed the character in the movie, will direct.\n\nMeanwhile, Jackson is involved in producing and writing the highly anticipated film.\n\nJackson also spoke fondly of his recent work on documentaries, particularly the Beatles’ \"Get Back project.\"\n\n“I’ve enjoyed doing various things with The Beatles, which is great, and that'll probably carry on,” he added.",

    "News_title":"Senate Democrats press ICE on uniform, mask protocol",
    "News_text":"A group of Senate Democrats are pressing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on the masking of officers not in uniform during its operations.\n\nIn the letter, sent to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, the group of Democrats argued the masks and lack of uniforms have led to chaos in Los Angeles as agents have looked to make arrests. The letter also accused ICE of seeking to meet “arbitrary quotas” set by Stephen Miller, a key adviser to President Trump widely seen as demanding huge increases in ICE detentions.\n\n“We write regarding the apparent widespread violations of historical norms and traditions in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (“ICE”) operations in Los Angeles and across the country by engaging in law enforcement activities—including arrests—without wearing identifying uniforms and while masked,” the lawmakers wrote.\n\n“As ICE engages in unprecedented numbers of immigration raids across the country, reportedly in response to arbitrary quotas set by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, it is crucial that ICE personnel not engage in conduct that is all but guaranteed to sow chaos and confusion and put law enforcement officers in danger,” the group added.\n\nThe Monday letter is signed by Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla (Calif.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Jacky Rosen (Nev.), Adam Schiff (Calif.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Ron Wyden (Ore.), Patty Murray (Wash.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), Peter Welch (Vt.), Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Tina Smith (Minn.), Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Raphael Warnock (Ga.).\n\nThe Hill has reached out to ICE and the White House for comment.\n\nSince his return to office a few months ago, Trump’s administration has cracked down intensely on immigration, resulting in backlash from Democrats and those on the American left.\n\nIn their letter, the group of Democrats questioned ICE on its “policies with regards to wearing masks while on duty” and its “policies with regards to wearing uniforms or other identifiable markers while on duty.”\n\n“Storming courthouses, grabbing students off the street, raiding places of work, and sweeping through restaurants at prime dining hours are in and of themselves tactics clearly designed to engender fear and sow chaos in the population,” the senators said.\n\n“Doing so in plainclothes, with no identification of their name or agency, while wearing a mask designed to obscure the agent’s face, represents a clear attempt to compound that fear and chaos – and to avoid accountability for agents’ actions.”\n\nWhen reached for comment about the letter and the comments in it about Miller, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said, “heroic ICE officers are simply doing their jobs and enforcing federal immigration law, with the utmost professionalism.”\n\n“Dangerous smears and misinformation from elected Democrats radicalize their supporters to violently attack and obstruct federal law enforcement,” Jackson added. “This letter is just another attempt to demonize law enforcement officers. Because of comments from the left, assaults against ICE agents have increased by nearly 700% this year.”\n\nUpdated at 8:06 p.m. EDT.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_text":"AUSTIN (KXAN) — In the aftermath of the Kerr County flooding, there are growing questions about how the response was handled as leaders at all levels continue looking for answers.\n\n“I think there’s certainly a lot of questions that need to be answered, you know, the how and the why are always something that we’re going to look at in the wake of a tragedy,” said State Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso. “And that’s something we owe to the people of Texas, to those families who have suffered immensely, we owe that to them.”\n\nFederal leaders spar on NWS flood warning response, pose safety review after Texas disaster\n\nMoody wants to see long-term and immediate changes that could include funding for outdoor warning sirens.\n\n“When we’re talking about short-term solutions, like these flood warning systems,” Moody said. “Those are things we can do right now.”\n\nOn Tuesday, State Rep. Drew Darby, R-San Angelo,shared a letter he sent Gov. Greg Abbott on social media.Darby wants to see a failed bill co-authored by Moody,House Bill 13, resurface.KXAN first reportedon the bill over the weekend. If passed, it would have developed a statewide strategic plan that included “the use of outdoor warning sirens.” A newly formed council would have been asked to “develop and implement, as advisable, emergency alert systems and incorporate as necessary communication technologies into the emergency communications network of this state.”\n\n“While we cannot change the past, we must act now to better prepare our communities for future natural disasters and ensure our neighbors have the resources to rebuild,”Darby wrote on X. “This includes, among other things, investing in a more robust and comprehensive alert system, as well as ensuring a coordinated, long-term recovery effort that leaves no community behind.”\n\nHis letter asked the governor to urgently consider adding “strengthening the ability of our state and local communities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters” to the July 21 special session.\n\nOn Tuesday, Abbott said “at the top” of the agenda will be helping communities impacted.\n\n“We’re going to start a special session two Mondays from now. A special session that will have at the top of its agenda helping communities like in Kerr County, Kendall County, as well as in Central Texas and the Big Country — all areas affected by the floods of the past week — those issues are going to be on the agenda for the state to address, from top to bottom,” Abbott said. “We want to make sure that when we end that session, we end it making sure these communities are better, more resilient and have the resources that they need for the next chapter of their lives.”\n\n“You’re going to see a bipartisan group of legislators lock arms and work on solutions to these problems,” Moody said.\n\nFollowing Texas floods, warning sirens get renewed attention\n\nREAD: Congressman Doggett’s letter to NOAA sent July 8Download\n\nOn the federal level, elected leaders are looking for lessons.\n\n“Most people at 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. are asleep,” said U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. “And, so, I think we will have a reasonable conversation about A, are there any ways to have earlier detection?”\n\nOn Monday,Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz told NBC Newsthat flood sirens, and resources for smaller counties to respond and prepare for disasters, will likely be discussed at the federal level.\n\n“Look, I think that’s certainly a discussion that will flow in the weeks and months ahead,” Cruz said. “I think we need to look at what happened, what transpired and how we could have moved more quickly to get people who are vulnerable out of harm’s way in particular those kids in the cabins by the river.”\n\n“How we make that happen, I think, is a very reasonable discussion,” he added. “It should be a bipartisan discussion. And, I expect it to happen at the local level, the state level and the federal level.”\n\nA day afterKXAN highlighted cities, like San Marcos, that have outdoor warning sirens, Congressman Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, said he is “certainly in favor” of discussing the issue on a federal level.\n\n“It’s amazing that a county [Kerr County] that encourages people from all over the state and the country to come there for camping did not have sirens of the type we have in San Marcos,” Doggett said.\n\nIn a letter sent Tuesday, first obtained by KXAN, Doggett asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to answer 14 questions. He is asking for details about any communication between the National Weather Service Austin\/San Antonio office and Kerr County or camp leaders before the flooding began.\n\nDoggett also wants to know how staffing cuts have impacted operations.KXAN previouslyfound six vacancies in the NWS Austin\/San Antonio office, according to its online staff roster and the NWS Employees Organization. Those include three meteorologists, two technology staff members and a science officer. The office has 26 employees when fully staffed.\n\n“I think we need that information,” Doggett said. “We need to know the impact of these cutbacks and hiring freezes not just to find out the results of the disaster but to prevent other disasters from occurring.”\n\nThe White House said the NWS “did its job” and, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas,joined Cruz in pushing back against the criticism.\n\n“Based on the briefing I’ve received, all of these sort of political finger pointing and blame game is totally out of line,” Cornyn said. “There was not shortage of resources available. Unfortunately, this was a 100-year flood in a very vulnerable area, with a very vulnerable population.”\n\nCornyn said Congress will do “everything we can to prevent tragedies like this from occurring in the future.”\n\n“We would try to learn from this and say, ‘What can we do to maybe prevent or mitigate something like this from happening?,'” he said.\n\nOver the weekend,Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem visited the areaalong the Guadalupe River, calling the amount of rain in the flooding event “unprecedented,” broadly referencing the administration’s goal to “fix” aging technology within NOAA – the parent agency to the NWS.\n\n“I do carry your concerns back to the federal government and back to President Trump,” Noem said, acknowledging the need to upgrade “ancient” technology so “families have as much warning as possible.”\n\nOn Tuesday, officials said the NWS “fulfilled its public safety mission” by issuing more than 60 warnings before the flooding occurred.\n\n“The simple fact is most government systems are antiquated and running on legacy technology — that’s been the norm across nearly every agency, under both Republican and Democrat administrations, for decades,” a DHS spokesperson said. “It’s simply not realistic to overhaul every outdated system at once. That’s why this administration is taking a hard look at these longstanding issues as part of our broader push to protect taxpayer dollars, strengthen accountability, and modernize where it makes the most sense.”\n\nAmid the state and national recoil, President Donald Trump plans to visit Texas Friday to see the damage firsthand.\n\n“This is a 100-year catastrophe,” Trump said. “And it’s just so horrible to watch.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Crypto taxpayers are in for a rude awakening.\n\nWe’re 16+ years into Bitcoin, yet taxpayers and CPAs still pretend that tax guidance remains unclear or even nonexistent. The IRS is gearing up for a historic wave of compliance audits targeting the crypto space, and taxpayers have no idea what they’re in for.\n\nLast year, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2024-28, fundamentally changing how crypto should be tracked from a tax perspective. Providing crystal clear guidance, safe harbors for taxpayers to get compliant, and deadlines to migrate by. The rules are clear, the expectations set, with the IRS quietly positioning itself to issue a wave of compliance audits for those still with their head in the sand.\n\nThe reckoning is already beginning as we’re seeing an unprecedented amount of 6174, 6174-A, and 6173 letters being sent out by the IRS.\n\nTypically, this time of the year is quiet. But for the past several weeks, our phone has been ringing non-stop from taxpayers receiving these notices from the IRS demanding they get compliant “or else.” And it’s not just us – crypto tax firms across the board are reporting the same activity, indicating the IRS knows taxpayers have casually engaged in crypto tax evasion, and they are here to collect what they’ve failed to collect for the past decade.\n\nStrategically pairing Rev-Proc 24-28 with the release of the new Form 1099-DA, the IRS is positioned to blindside taxpayers and CPAs who have neglected getting compliant. The 2025 tax year will be pivotal as the IRS now has an abundance of ammunition to use in audits. Gone are the days where taxpayers could defer to defenses like “well, the guidance was unclear, so I just did my best.” The IRS has been explicit, the guidance is clear, and the penalties for non-compliance have been outlined, yet taxpayers and CPAs still assume we’re in the Wild West.\n\nOn top of this, Form 1099-DAs will be issued to both taxpayers and the IRS alike by brokers, but there’s a major catch: the form won’t include cost basis for the 2025 tax year, and will almost certainly include incorrect cost basis for years after.\n\nThat means when you transfer assets into an exchange and later sell them, the sale gets reported — but the exchange has no idea what you originally paid. In the absence of that information, the form defaults to showing a $0 cost basis. To the IRS or a traditional CPA, it looks like pure profit.\n\nSay you buy 1 ETH for $2,200, move it to Coinbase, and sell it for $2,500. If Coinbase doesn’t have the cost basis, the form shows a $2,500 gain. Your actual gain was $300 — but unless you’ve tracked that basis yourself, the IRS won’t know. And they’ll assume the worst.\n\nThis isn’t a one-off scenario. It’s going to affect hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.\n\nIf those inflated gains go uncorrected, they’ll either result in unnecessary tax owed or trigger an audit. And many CPAs won’t catch it, because most still aren’t equipped to handle crypto properly. They don’t understand how wallets work. They confuse transfers with sales. They miss staking rewards and DeFi activity entirely. Clients think their CPA is on top of it. CPAs assume the 1099 is accurate. No one’s double-checking.\n\nThat’s where things go wrong. And that’s exactly what the IRS is counting on.\n\nThe old defense — that the guidance wasn’t clear — doesn’t hold up anymore. The IRS has been direct. The expectations are spelled out. The time to fix things is NOW, before an enforcement letter is received.\n\nCrypto isn’t some edge case anymore. Tens of millions of Americans have bought, sold, staked, lent, or transferred digital assets. Most have done a poor job keeping records. Some haven’t even tried. The result is a tax system full of underreported gains, misclassified income, inconsistent filings, and the taxman looking for revenge.\n\nThe most common mistakes aren’t complex. Transfers between wallets are flagged as sales. Assets appear on exchanges with no cost basis attached. Staking rewards and airdrops go unreported. DeFi activity is missing entirely. And year after year, taxpayers and professionals rely on CSV exports that were never designed for tax reporting in the first place.\n\nThese aren’t edge cases. They’re pervasive amongst crypto investors. And at scale, they add up to a compliance problem the IRS is now fully equipped to pursue.\n\nThis is no longer about gray areas or technicalities. It’s about a growing mismatch between how taxpayers think crypto taxes work — and how the IRS now expects them to be handled. That gap is where the risk lives, and with the established guidance, the IRS won’t be pulling any punches.",

    "News_text":"Two young children of a U.S. Army soldier stationed at Fort Bliss were among the three people killed in a record-breaking flash flood that swept through a village in New Mexico on Tuesday, local officials said.\n\nThe three were \"swept downstream by the unprecedented floodwaters that struck\" the Village of Ruidoso, village officials said in a statement.\n\n\"The biggest catastrophe of all are the lives that we lost,\" Mayor Lynn Crawford said during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe two children were identified as Charlotte Trotter, 4, and Sebastian Trotter, 7, according to their aunt Tiffanie Wyatt. She said their father, Sebastian Trotter, a solder based at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, and their mother, Stephanie, both suffered serious injuries but survived and were receiving medical treatment at a hospital in Texas.\n\n\"We want everyone to know that the kids were full of life and always laughing,\" Wyatt told ABC News in a statement. \"Sebastian was an avid Pokémon card collector, loved to play sports, but was a huge soccer fanatic. He wanted to be a professional soccer player when he got older. Charlotte loved to be the center of attention. She loved to sing, dance, and make jokes. She also loved to give people makeovers with her play makeup.\"\n\nShe added, \"The kids knew nothing but love and we believe they felt it to the very end.\"\n\nThe family also lost two dogs in the flood, a 4-year-old German Shepherd named Ellie and a 9-year-old husky named Zeus.\n\nThe third person who died in the flooding -- a man in his 40s or 50s -- has not been publicly identified.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy with grief following this devastating loss.

Three individuals were transported to the hospital for treatment, but all are in stable condition, officials said. Preliminary findings show that around 35 to 50 homes were damaged or lost in the floods, officials said.\n\nOfficials said they were prepared for potential flooding due to their \"multi-alert system,\" which includes a traditional siren, door-to-door knocking and \"opt-in\" notifications for residents to receive alerts on their phones.\n\n\"We always urge citizens to not rely on one emergency alert system,\" village officials said on Wednesday. \"Layers save lives.\"\n\nThe Rio Ruidoso rose \"to a record-breaking 20 feet -- 5 feet higher than the previous record,\" officials said. The area was pummeled with 3.5 inches of rain in about 90 minutes, which impacted the community \"head on,\" officials said on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the rescues, officials said they found people in trees, in the water or trapped in their homes.\n\n\"The flash flooding occurred Tuesday afternoon when heavy monsoonal rains fell on burn scar areas from last year's South Fork and Salt fires, creating dangerous conditions that led to rapid water rise throughout the village,\" the village said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Albuquerquesaidearly data placed the river's crest at 20.24 feet on Tuesday afternoon, which would break the record of 15.86 feet that was set on July 20, 2024.\n\nThe highest measured rainfall was 3.29 inches on the southwest side of the South Fork burn scar. But generally speaking between 1.5 and 3.5 inches of rain fell on the burn scar and up to 1.5 inches fell in the village of Ruidoso.\n\nPrior to the floods, the National Weather Service issued a flash food watch on Tuesday at 8 a.m., which was followed by a flash flood warning at 2:20 p.m., officials said. Less than half an hour later, a flash flood emergency was issued at 2:47 p.m., officials said.\n\n\"As you can tell, it came on pretty suddenly,\" Crawford said Wednesday.\n\nBut officials said they were not just relying on alerts, with the National Guard already in place before the flooding began.\n\nThe threat for rain and flooding is not over in the area.\n\nMORE: Texas flooding victims: From young campers to a dad saving his family, what we know about the lives lost\n\nA flood watch is in effect over this specific area -- Ruidoso and Capitan -- for Wednesday afternoon because there is a chance for 1-inch per hour rainfall rates with isolated downpours possible in the region. Another round of rain is possible in the evening as well. If another downpour happens, flash flooding can begin rapidly just like Tuesday.\n\nVillage officials said they are in \"close contact\" with state officials and the request for federal disaster assistance has already been issued.\n\nThere have been multiple flash flooding events in the same region since the South Fork Fire in June 2024 burned more than 17,000 acres. Prior to Tuesday's event, Ruidoso suffered serious flash flooding as recently as June 26.\n\nA full damage assessment is underway but will take \"several days\" to complete, officials said on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials said anyone with information on those missing in the floods should call their missing persons hotline at 575-637-0328.",

    "News_title":"Geothermal survives in 'big, beautiful' budget bill — but hurdles remain",
    "News_text":"Geothermal energy was spared in President Donald Trump’ssweeping tax and spending law, which made deep cuts to incentives for other forms of clean energy. But developers of the resurgent energy source may still face difficulties ahead due to complex stipulations folded into the new law, among other Trump administration policies.\n\nThe “big, beautiful” Republican legislation largely preserves investment and production tax credits for geothermal power plants — as well as battery storage, nuclear, and hydropower projects — established by the Inflation Reduction Act. Incentives for wind and solar, however, aresharply curtailed, and subsidies for residential clean energy projects will abruptly end after this year.\n\nGeothermal advocates celebrated the outcome for their industry, which they say will be vital to scaling the resource in the United States to meet the nation’s soaring power demand. The sector hasattracted a lot of attentionin recent years because it can provide carbon-free power around the clock — something solar and wind can’t do — and technological advances are making it possible to deploy geothermal in places that conventional plants can’t go.\n\nThis “policy milestone highlights the geothermal industry’s role in fortifying grid resilience and national security,” Vanessa Robertson, director of policy and education for Geothermal Rising, an industry association, said in a statement. “With certainty in place, we look forward to seeing projects advance and innovative partnerships flourish.”\n\nStill, the industry isn’t immune to the broader market challenges created by Trump’s policies, despite its more favorable treatment from Congress.\n\nNew tariffs on things like steel and aluminum haveincreased the costof drilling equipment, heat exchangers, and other key components. A provision in the budget bill aimed at restricting Chinese companies and individuals from accessing tax credits will make it harder for developers to prove compliance,increasing the risk for investorswho finance clean energy projects.\n\n“We’re making an ugly layered cake of barriers to quick and clean project development,” said Advait Arun, a senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, a nonprofit think tank.\n\nGeothermal plants, whichharness Earth’s heatto generate power, have for decades represented less than 1% of the U.S. electricity mix. That’s because conventional plants tend to be viable only when located near natural formations like hot springs, where the heat is easier to reach, but which only occur in a handful of places in the United States.\n\nNew tools and techniques are emerging that make it possible to put geothermal plants in more parts of the country.\n\nThe startup Fervo Energy completed America’s first “enhanced geothermal system” in late 2023 — a3.5-megawatt pilot plantin Nevada backed by Google. Now, the Houston-based company is building the world’s first large-scale enhanced geothermal plant in Utah’s high desert. Fervo has raisedhundreds of millions of dollars in capitalto drill dozens of wells for the 500-megawatt Cape Station, with the first 100 MW slated to start delivering power to the grid in 2026.\n\nIn June, the startup XGS Energy announcedplans to builda 150-MW next-generation geothermal project in New Mexico by 2030 to support Meta’s data center operations. Meta, which owns Facebook and WhatsApp,signed a similar agreementlast year with Sage Geosystems to build 150 MW of geothermal power at an unspecified site east of the Rocky Mountains. The first phase of that project is set to come online in 2027.\n\nGeothermal has long drawn bipartisan support and has so far dodged Trump’s broader attacks on renewable energy. It helps that the new geothermal wave has considerable overlap with the oil and gas industry, sharing the same drilling equipment, workforce, and investors. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, previously the CEO of a fracking company that invested in Fervo,played an active roleduring budget negotiations to shield geothermal from sweeping cuts to Inflation Reduction Act incentives.\n\nUnder the new law, geothermal and other baseload clean power sourcescan qualifyfor the full 48E investment tax credit or the 45Y production tax credit if they begin construction by 2033, after which point the credits will gradually decrease to zero in 2036. The concrete phase-out schedule differs from the IRA, which allowed more flexibility and could’ve kept the incentives in place for several more years, according to Geothermal Rising.\n\nWind and solar facilities, meanwhile, must either start operating before the end of 2027 or begin construction by next summer to obtain credits.Geothermal heat pumps, which heat and cool buildings, will lose access to residential tax credits after 2025.\n\nFor next-generation geothermal firms, the tax incentives are crucial to getting the first slate of projects up and running. Developers use the promise of future tax credits as collateral to raise the many millions in financing they need to explore suitable project sites and deploy novel drilling technologies. The credits also help to attract major customers, including tech giants that are looking for a variety of baseload power sources to run their sprawling data centers.\n\n“They help the market to develop,” said Mehdi Yusifov, the director of data centers and AI at Project InnerSpace, a geothermal advocacy group. “Tax credits of this kind can … help get infrastructure built on a mega scale.”\n\nYusifov and Nico Enriquez, a principal at Future Ventures, studied the potential cost of serving a “hyperscale” data center with power from a 1-gigawatt enhanced geothermal project in a place like the Western U.S. In anew analysis, they found this novel project could achieve alevelized cost of energyof $119 per megawatt-hour without the investment tax credit — significantly better than estimated costs for nuclear power. With the tax credit, the hypothetical geothermal system could achieve $88 per megawatt-hour, which is competitive with the upper range for a fossil-gas power plant.\n\n“It seems like there’s a dam that would break if it could be proven that [geothermal] can produce power anywhere in the range below Three Mile Island,” said Enriquez, referring to the shuttered nuclear plant in Pennsylvania that isexpected to restartto serve Microsoft’s growing energy appetite.\n\n“That’s another reason why this investment tax credit is so important, because it makes it possible to have the dam break,” he added. “And suddenly you can flood the market with these projects that are giving us critical infrastructure.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether the budget bill will undermine some next-generation projects due to the anti-China provisions attached to these key incentives. The rules, known as “foreign entity of concern” restrictions, will require companies to scrutinize their supply chains to an unprecedented degree, with potentially onerous and costly legal implications that make it harder for projects to claim incentives.\n\n“It remains to be seen how developers of these really innovative technologies can navigate this, because it’s not going to be the easiest process from here on out,” said Arun of the Center for Public Enterprise.\n\nEven as the headwinds swirl, geothermal developers continue to make significant strides to improve their technologies. Both Fervo and the federal Utah Forge initiative have said they’ve dramaticallyincreased drilling speedsandefficienciesin just a handful of years, with Fervoreducing its per-well costsby millions of dollars. For startups, access to tax incentives allows them to get to work to make such advances in the field, Enriquez said.\n\n“There’s an amount we save long-term if we invest upfront in these tax credits, because of the learning curve,” he said. “If we can maintain [the momentum] for the next five years, I think this industry will be one of the key power sources for the U.S.”",

    "News_title":"China Opens Up to Tourists as Trump’s U.S. Closes Itself Off",
    "News_text":"International travelers walk through an immigration checkpoint at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in China on May 30, 2025. Credit - VCG\/Getty Images\n\nAs the U.S. under President Donald Trump increasingly closes itself off from the world, denying entry to tourists amid a crackdown on border controls and migration, its geopolitical rival China, which has long been known for its relative isolation, has loosened its travel restrictions to unprecedented levels.\n\nBy July 16, China will have expanded visa-free entry to 75 countries as part of a broader campaign to boost inbound tourism, which has already seen a surge. Last year, over 20 million foreigners visited China without a visa, doubling that of the previous year, according to China’s National Immigration Administration. Shanghai alonereceived 2.6 million overseas visitsin the first half of this year, around half of which were visa-free entries, a 45% year-on-year increase. China has been steadily pushing for more people to visit since reopening its borders in early 2023, after its“Zero-COVID” policiesappeared for a time as though they mightdrive the countryinto alasting isolation.\n\nIt’s also part of China’s effort to boost its soft power, especially at a time when the Trump Administration appears to be withdrawing the U.S. from the global stage. In recent months, Trump hasmovedto restrictinternational studentsfrom the U.S.,impose sweeping tariffson the rest of the world, andshutter USAID, whilereportsof tourists beingdetainedordenied entryby Immigration and Customs Enforcement havedeterredsome from visiting the U.S.\n\nChina’s response to U.S. actions—including thetargeting of Chinese international studentsandU.S. interventionin theIsrael-Iran War—has been relatively restrained, signalling the country’s desire to maintain cordial diplomatic ties to the U.S., especially amidtrade negotiations, while also advocating for multilateralism like never before.\n\nThe U.S. has “demonstrated its military capabilities, its commitment to allies, and its influence in crisis management” through Trump’seffortstobrokerpeace dealsaround the world, at times wielding the threat of force, but “these are not the metrics by which China measures its global role,” says Lin Jing, a research fellow at the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore. “Instead, China continues to showcase its consistency and stability, its non-aligned posture, and its support for a U.N.-centered international order.”.\n\n“There’s recognition that when you don’t have people-to-people exchanges, you lose an important bulwark against populist rhetoric on both sides,” David Weeks, co-founder and chief operating officer of Sunrise International, a consulting firm that advises overseas universities on recruiting Chinese students,previously told TIME. “China thinks that we need more, not less, exchange if we have disagreements.”\n\nIn May, Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng emphasized the importance of people-to-people exchanges to U.S.-China relations, just as the U.S. announced enhanced screenings of student visa applicants from China and Hong Kong. “It is people-to-people ties that invigorate China-U.S. relations,” hesaidat his embassy. “We warmly welcome all American friends to travel in China, shop in China, succeed in China and take part in Chinese modernisation. Come and see the country with your own eyes.”\n\nInbound tourism could also help to rejuvenate China’s domestic economy, which the Chinese government hasprioritizedto mitigate against the worst effects of Trump’s tariffs as well as highyouth unemploymentand apersistent real estate crisis. China isopeningmore duty-free shops around the country in an effort to bolster spending within the country. Meanwhile, Chinese businesses, like‘Labubu’ toy retailer Pop Mart, havegained global popularity, boosting China’ssoft powerand interest around the world in visiting the country.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nMuch of Europe, Asia, and parts of the Middle East are able to travel to China without a visa.\n\nChina began expanding its visa-free scheme after reopening its borders in 2023 after inbound travel plummeted during the pandemic. The countrysawjust 14 million visitors in 2023 as compared to 32 million in 2019.\n\nSince then, Beijing hasintroduced or resumed visa-free entryfor visitors from nearly every European country, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and most Asian countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea. Citizens of five Latin American countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay—and Uzbekistan wereaddedto the scheme in June. Four countries in the Middle East—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia—were alsograntedvisa-free entry last month. Azerbaijan willbecomeeligible on July 16, bringing the total to 75. (By comparison, nationals from 42 countries have visa-free access to the U.S. for tourism or business stays up to 90 days under theVisa Waiver Program.)\n\nChina’s scheme allows citizens of eligible countries to enter without a visa for up to 30 days.\n\n“Our inbound tourism has already recovered to 70 to 80 per cent of pre-Covid levels. It could be fully recovered this year,” James Liang, chairman of China’s leading online travel service Ctrip,reportedly toldShanghai-based outlet The Paper. “There are still some bottlenecks to be addressed. If they are tackled, China’s inbound tourism could reach the world’s top tier in 10 or 20 years.”\n\nChina has alsoexpanded its transit policythat allows travellers from 55 countries to enter China without a visa for 10 days if they then depart for a different country from where they came. The transit policy includes 10 countries that are not part of the visa-free scheme: Canada, the Czech Republic, Indonesia, Lithuania, Mexico, Russia, the U.K., Ukraine, and the U.S.\n\nChina is also aiming toopen up Xinjiang—the Uyghur autonomous region that is under Western sanctions overhuman-rights concerns—to more domestic and foreign tourists. Earlier this year, local officials announced goals of bringing in at least 400 million annual visits to the region by 2030.\n\nChina’s opening up is happening against a backdrop of the U.S. tightening its visa rules.\n\nTrump has targeted international students in hiscrackdownon universities across the U.S. His punitive moves have included attempting toremove Harvard’s abilityto enroll international students,targeting foreign-born studentsfor removal from the country, and quietly revoking the visas of thousands of international students (beforereversingthe move). He’s also heightened screening requirements for student visa applicants—especially those from China—including requiring applicantsmake their social media accounts “public” for vetting.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Trump alsovowed to reinstate his travel banon travellers from Muslim countries, and in June heannounced a new travel banon nationals from 12 countries and tightened restrictions on nationals from seven more. And he isreportedlyconsidering adding 36 countries to the travel ban list.\n\nSeveral countries have issued advisories about travelling to the U.S., including China, whichadvisedits citizens to “fully assess the risks” before travelling to the U.S. because of “the deterioration in China-U.S. trade relations and the domestic security situation in the U.S.”\n\nSome European countries, including the U.K. and Germany,issued warningsafter multiple European travellers were detained at the U.S. border, some for weeks. Others, including Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands,cautionedtransgender and nonbinary travellers about U.S. travel after Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, and several states have targeted trans people. Canada, too,warnedits citizens about potential delays, denial of entry, and device seizures. Some Canadians have alsolaunched a travel boycottof the U.S., after Trump repeatedly threatened to use “economic force” tomake Canada the 51st stateof the U.S.\n\nOverseas travel to the U.S. has dropped 2.5% through April this year as compared to a year ago, Bloombergreported, with the largest drop of 10% happening in March after Trump announced tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. The World Travel & Tourism Councilestimatesthat the U.S. will lose out on $12.5 billion from tourism this year, although some suggest theshortfall could be as high as $29 billion.\n\nContact usatletters@time.com.",

    "News_text":"PARIS (AP) — French police raided the headquarters of far-right partyNational Rallyon Wednesday and seized documents and accounting records, the party's leader said, as part of a sweeping campaign finance inquiry.\n\nProsecutors said they are investigating allegations of illegal financing of longtime party leader Marine Le Pen’s 2022 presidential bid, and the party's European Parliament and French parliamentary campaigns. The National Rally, which seeks to sharply curtail migration and restrict Muslims' rights, is the biggest single party in France's lower house of parliament.\n\nJordan Bardella, 29, whotook over the presidencyof the popular party in 2022, said that police seized “all files relating to the party’s recent regional, presidential, legislative, and European campaigns — in other words, all of its electoral activity.\"\n\nBardella slammed the raid in a message on X. “This spectacular and unprecedented operation is clearly part of a new harassment operation. It is a serious attack on pluralism and democratic change,” he said.\n\nThe raid came after Le Pen — runner-up to incumbent President Emmanuel Macron in 2022 — wasconvicted of embezzlementin April and barred from seeking office for five years. She and 24 other party officialswere accused of having used moneyintended for European Union parliamentary aides to instead pay staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, violating the 27-nation bloc’s regulations.\n\nBut Wednesday's raid stems from a different, more recent case.\n\nThe Paris prosecutor’s office said in a statement to the AP that searches were carried out at the National Rally's headquarters, at the headquarters of unidentified companies and at the homes of people leading those companies.\n\nThe searches were prompted by a judicial inquiry opened a year ago into a raft of allegations, including fraud, money laundering and forgery, the prosecutor's office said.\n\nThe inquiry aims to determine whether Le Pen's 2022 presidential campaign, and the party's campaigns for European Parliament in 2024 and French parliamentary elections in 2022, were financed by “illegal loans from individuals for the benefit of the party or National Rally candidates,” the statement said.\n\nThe inquiry is also investigating allegations that the National Rally overbilled for services or billed for fictitious services in order to artificially augment the amount of state aid provided to the party for its electoral campaigns.\n\nThe prosecutor's office says no one has been charged in the case.\n\nBardella said on X that the investigation targets National Rally members who loan money to the party because banks won’t, calling the raids a ″spectacle″ serving political ends.\n\nFormer party treasurer Wallerand de Saint-Just told reporters outside the headquarters, ’’We did nothing wrong.″\n\nLe Pen has not commented publicly.\n\nThe National Rally was born from a party withracist and antisemitic rootsfounded by Le Pen's father.\n\nIn recent years, the party has broadened its messaging and seen its support rise steadily. It has longstanding ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and took out a loan from a Czech-Russian bank in 2014 because it said it could not get credit elsewhere.\n\nLe Pen had been considered a top contender for France's 2027 presidential election before her March conviction.\n\nWhile her appeal in that case is pending, she asked the European Court of Human Rights for emergency action to suspend the ban on running for office. The court rejected her request Wednesday, arguing that there was no ‘’imminent risk of irreparable harm'' to her human rights.\n\n——\n\nAssociated Press journalists Alex Turnbull and Oleg Cetinic in Paris and Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report.",

It risks leaving some government services and capabilities so depleted that they won’t be able to be restored even if the workers ultimately prevail in court.\n\nJackson appears to be the only justice cognizant of those risks, and she let loose in a howl of a dissent that pegged the historical moment just right: “In my view, this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground.”\n\nThe decision by the other justices, Jackson warned, will “allow an apparently unprecedented and congressionally unsanctioned dismantling of the Federal Government to continue apace, causing irreparable harm before courts can determine whether the President has the authority to engage in the actions he proposes.”\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Department of Energy has hired three scientists well known for their contrarianism about anthropogenic climate change, theNYT reports:\n\nphysicistSteven E.

She ordered the administration to facilitate Cristian’s return, but it has continued to provided vague and non-responsive status reports pointing the finger at El Salvador for not providing more information.\n\nIn a stern letter to the attorneys in the case, Gallagher wrote:\n\nIn status reports submitted pursuant to this Court’s June 5, 2025 Order, Defendants have repeatedly skirted this Court’s directive to provide information regarding the steps they have taken and will take to facilitate the return of Cristian to the United States. Instead, Defendants have repeatedly made oblique references to their request of “assistance” from the U.S. Department of State (DOS), which has “enter[ed] into negotiations to facilitate Cristian’s return” and “assumed responsibility on behalf of the U.S. Government for…diplomatic discussions with El Salvador.”\n\nGallagher ordered the Trump administration to explain to her by next Tuesday why, in light of the UN report, it keeps insisting that diplomacy by the State Department is required to facilitate Cristian’s return.\n\nIn the meantime, another new development suggests that the United States does have control over the detainees it sent to CECOT.

    "News_text":"More than 90 Democratic lawmakersfiled a briefwith a federal court this week telling it to block an agreement between the IRS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that would give the immigration agency access to private taxpayer data.\n\nThe group of 93 senators and representatives called the data sharing agreement “unprecedented” and said it violates U.S. tax law.\n\n“Despite clear congressional intent and decades of consistent IRS policy, the Trump administration is attempting to weaponize our tax code to meet arbitrary and draconian immigration enforcement quotas,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement along with the amicus brief, filed in Centro de Trabajadores Unidos v. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nIn the U.S., workers who are in the country illegally still often pay income and other types of taxes, as their wages can be subject to the same withholding and tax filing obligations U.S. citizens and other authorized workers are subject to.\n\n“It’s no accident that the IRS and Congress for decades allowed all workers to pay into our system — it is an obvious and indisputable benefit for our nation,” Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said in a statement.\n\n“The Trump administration seeks to upend a successful and proven policy for no discernible gain whatsoever. It’s expensive, it’s inhuman and it further erodes trust in our institutions.”\n\nIn May, a federal district court let the information-sharing agreement between the IRS and ICEgo into effect.\n\nThe agreement allows ICE to access information provided on federal tax returns for the purposes of immigration enforcement.\n\nIt references a Jan. 20 executive order from President Trump meant to deliver “enhanced vetting and screening across agencies.”\n\nThe order directs the secretary of State and other top officials to “vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.”\n\nUnder the agreement, ICE can request information from tax returns for criminal investigations unrelated to tax compliance.\n\nA district court approved the agreement after a legal challenge, which has since been raised to the appellate level, though a date for an oral argument has not been scheduled yet.\n\nMany immigration and legal groups have voiced concerns about the agreement.\n\nThe American Immigration Council said it “blurs the distinction between criminal and civil immigration enforcement.”\n\n“It remains unclear how broadly ICE will interpret its authority under the agreement,” attorneys for law firm Fox Rothschild wrote in a May analysis.\n\nPrivacy issues about taxpayer information at the IRS have been a concern for Republicans in recent years as well, following the leak of billionaires’ tax returns to the publication ProPublica.\n\n“The leak or hack of private taxpayer information and unauthorized disclosure by advocates at ProPublica cannot be ignored or swept under the rug,” Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said in a 2021 letter after the tax returns of Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and others were published by the outlet.\n\nThe Trump administration has been carrying out a wide-ranging migrant crackdown in different states that migrant groups have said are violating the law.\n\n“Recent weeks have seen intensified ICE raids in immigrant-rich communities … with families reporting early morning arrests, racial profiling, and detentions without legal support,” the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts said in a statement in May.\n\nOne worker, identified only as Isabel in the LUCE statement, described violent actions being carried out by ICE.\n\n“ICE is breaking car windows, forcibly exploiting people, breaking down doors without a criminal record, and taking away hardworking people whose only crime is seeking a better life,” the woman said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"'Gaza remains main obstacle to regional peace deal,' leading Saudi journalist tells 'Post'",
    "News_text":"Saudi and Syrian nationals spoke at a rare conference in the Knesset, with one telling the 'Post' that \"Gaza is the main obstacle to regional peace\".\n\nThe Gaza Stripremains the main obstacle to a regional peace deal, Saudi journalist and researcher Abdulaziz Alkhamis said to The Jerusalem Post following a conference in the Knesset on Wednesday. “If [the] Gaza war finishes and there is a peace deal and some stable solution, we will go to the next step with the Americans to do a peace deal for the region,” he said.\n\nBut this needs to be a “full solution” that involves the entire region, including Iran and Turkey.\n\n“It is very hard, because some countries have their own interests … [Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali] Khamenei loves war and wants war to continue, but there is a change. The Iranians suffered from this war … there is a change in the Iranian mentality, and they have come to the table,” Alkhamis said.\n\nThe Americans also wanted to “stop Gaza” and bring people to Washington in order to negotiate a “full solution.”\n\n“The Americans and Saudis have the same interest – a two-state solution. The problem is [Prime Minister Benjamin]Netanyahu,” Alkhamis said.\n\nAlkhamis spoke to the Post following a conference at the Knesset on Wednesday titled “Opportunities for a Regional Agreement Following the ‘Swords of Iron War’ and ‘Rising Lion’ Operation.” The conference served as the launch of a Knesset caucus called “The Caucus to Promote a Regional Security Agreement.” An organization called “The Coalition for Regional Security” helped organize the event.\n\nThe Coalition, according to its website, represents a “wide and diverse group of public figures and opinion leaders in the security, diplomacy, business, hi-tech, and research fields who joined together to ensure the security of the State of Israel through the promotion of the ‘Abraham Shield Plan.’”\n\nThe Abraham Shield Plan, according to the website, is a “new Israeli political-security initiative that paves the way for the State of Israel to emerge from wars of attrition to a reality of security, stability, and prosperity – based on the current regional opportunity.”\n\nAlkhamis, a native of Saudi Arabia and based in the UAE, is a journalist and researcher and a host on SkyNews Arabia. He has been involved in discreet conversations on Gaza’s future and normalization with Israel. In his remarks during the conference, Alkhamis argued that normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia cannot come at the expense of “Palestinian dignity.”\n\nAccording to Alkhamis, Gaza was not just a “humanitarian tragedy” but also a “strategic failure by all those who believe in a peaceful, flourishing region.” He explained that normalization between the two countries would not be just a dual agreement but would include a regional “realignment” including the Palestinians.\n\nThe “bare minimum,” according to Alkhamis, was the creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state “built in partnership with regional stakeholders,” with a technocratic government in place for an interim period, and a “clear Israeli commitment not just to security but to coexistence.”\n\nSpeaking “frankly and directly,” Alkhamis acknowledged that “Israel today holds unprecedented military dominance, regional deterrence, and – after Iran’s setback – a window of strategic leverage.” But “power unused for peace is power squandered,” and “victory on the battlefield must translate into a vision at the table,” Alkhamis said.\n\nHe added, “You now have an opportunity – perhaps the last one in a generation – to move beyond managing conflict to shaping a region … and let me be equally frank: should Israel ignore this moment – should it establish occupation, humiliate Gaza further, or treat regional normalization as a zero-sum equation – it will not only lose Saudi Arabia. It will lose the Arab world’s new consensus for integration.”\n\nAt the “edge of a new era,” the “choice is stark,” Alkhamis said. “Do we cling to the 20th century – with its borders soaked in blood and ideologies stuck in time? Or do we redraw the map – geopolitically, economically, morally?”\n\n“Normalization is not surrender. It is a bold claim that the future belongs to builders, not bombers, that diplomacy is not weakness – but the highest form of strength. Let this be our region’s October 7 moment – not a day of descent into darkness, but the point at which we chose the light,” the Saudi journalist concluded.\n\nParticipation by notable Saudi activists in the Knesset is rare. An even rarer occurrence is the appearance of Syrian nationals. One such participant was Shadi Martini, the Chief Executive Officer of the Multifaith Alliance (MFA) and a former General Manager of a hospital in Aleppo.\n\nMARTINI WAS involved in the Syrian war and played a key role in creating a cross-border partnership between Syrians and Israelis, which was later incorporated into the “Good Neighbors” project. Following the transition in Syria, Martini returned to Damascus, where he met with top Syrian officials to discuss ties with Israel.\n\nIn his speech at the conference, Martini said that many Syrians were “wondering” what Israel’s endgame was regarding Syria. Syrians were encouraged by Israel’s success against Hezbollah, which he said was the catalyst for the fall of the Assad regime. They viewed this as the fall of a “common enemy.”\n\nHowever, subsequent Israeli actions, including operations in border areas in which Syrian farmers were killed, led to confusion as to what Israel’s ultimate goals were.\n\nMartini said that he met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa several weeks ago. The president said that the current situation was an “opportunity of once every 100 years” and that the window of opportunity will “not always stay open.” Martini expressed hope that children in the region will “live in dignity and prosperity” and that the conference was a step in that direction.\n\nThe conference was backed by the Coalition for Regional Security, the Darkenu movement, and Commanders for Israel’s Security, and participants included current and former politicians, diplomats, and businesspeople. The Knesset Caucus that hosted the conference is chaired by Democrats MK Gilad Kariv, Yesh Atid MK Ram Ben-Barak, and Blue and White MK Alon Schuster.\n\nKariv said at the start of the meeting, “What must begin with a comprehensive deal to end the war and return all the hostages could and must continue with bold agreements that will transform the region. These agreements would establish a coalition of moderates against the axis of Iran and its proxies and bring hope to both peoples in this land and to all the nations descended from Abraham.”\n\n“The movement toward such agreements – and the lessons of October 7 – require the understanding that we cannot strive for a different reality in the Gaza Strip or for separation from the Palestinians through an agreement without a broad, intensive, meaningful, promising, and prosperous regional framework of accords between Israel and the surrounding countries,” Kariv said.\n\nOpposition leader MK Yair Lapid argued that peace with Syria was possible, on one condition.\n\n“I told the Emirates in Abu Dhabi – we will know how to build an entire regional coalition around [Syrian president] al-Julani that will assist in rehabilitating Syria if he drops the issue of the Golan Heights,” Lapid said.\n\nAccording to IDF Brig.-Gen. (res.) Udi Dekel, a founding partner of the Coalition for Regional Security, Director of the Conflict to Agreements research program (INSS), and a former head of a negotiation team with the Palestinians, “Opportunities don’t just fall from the sky – they also vanish. If we don’t act correctly and swiftly, we’ll miss the opportunity. What are the advantages of the regional coalition we’re trying to advance? A bloc of moderate and responsible nations aiming to counter the radical axis of states.”\n\n“The threat of a nuclear Iran and the proxies in the region has not ended,” Dekel said. “We urgently need this cooperation to stabilize the area. We can reach agreements with Lebanon and Syria. Arab states have placed a plan on the table in which they are prepared to take responsibility for the Gaza Strip – and the State of Israel has rejected this plan.”\n\nLianne Pollak-David, founding partner of the Coalition, former advisor at the Prime Minister’s Office and National Security Council, and a member of negotiating teams with Palestinians, added during the conference, “Since the horrific massacre of October 7, Israel has risen from the ruins and led tectonic changes. This must be said very clearly – the transformation is happening thanks to the military strength of the State of Israel.\n\n“At the same time, it’s clearer than ever: military power alone is not enough. The next challenge is to realize our diplomatic strength as well … The regional agreement must be the compass for the entire pragmatic camp in Israel,” Pollak-David concluded.\n\nA Darkenu poll conducted by Panel4All ahead of the caucus’s launch revealed that a large majority of the Israeli public was already looking toward the day after. The poll found that 70% of Israelis support a US-backed regional security arrangement and a two-state solution in the long term – including a surprising 63.6% of coalition voters.\n\nSome 65.7% of the Israeli public said they believed that Israel had achieved the objectives of the war in Gaza and could end the fighting. Some 67.7% said they believed that Iran remained a significant threat to Israel, and 75% thought that Israel was dependent on the US in dealing with this threat.",

Joy Boyd helps out her elderly parents and has worked on getting them an appointment for weeks. Boyd’s parents, 88 and 92, need theirs due to potential travel to see a hospitalized family member. They have passports, but they expire in August, and they’re scared to send them in to renew, as they may not get the new ones in time.\n\n“So, I kept going online, day after day, and all times of the day,” said Boyd. “They were upset, they were frustrated with the system, not really knowing what they were going to do.”\n\nBecause they’re older, Boyd says, her parents aren’t very tech savvy, and they had difficulty navigating the system. So, they asked her to help. She says she was looking as far as September and still wasn’t finding anything.\n\nUltimately, she has one warning for others. “Don’t wait because of that bottleneck,” she said. “I know people have known. I know it’s a national security issue.

    "News_title":"How can families handle anxiety around summer camp after the Texas floods?",
    "News_text":"When tragedies are in the news — natural disasters, plane crashes, fires — parents naturally and unavoidably react by thinking about what might happen to their own children. And children worry in turn about what might happen to them.\n\nTheflash floodinglast week that killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River in central Texas, including dozens of campers and counselors at Camp Mystic, was a family nightmare come true. Every summer, kids hug their parents goodbye for camp, with both sides full of anxiety about what it means for children to be away from home and family.\n\nNow that those normal worries are being amplified by the news from Texas, what should parents and kids do?\n\nChildren who have been planning for camp should still go to camp, even if it feels difficult, saidDr. Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill-Cornell Medical College. “When we don’t do a behavior that makes us anxious, it restricts us further and actually tends to make us more anxious.”\n\nFear is understandable but it’s important to recognize when it becomes irrational and unnecessarily limiting, potentially even threatening formative experiences in children’s lives, Saltz said. The devastation at Camp Mystic feels especially distressing because summer camps are places people choose to go, that often hold their fondest memories.\n\nThe very nature of overnight camp removes the sense of control many parents feel when their children are home. “It’s a transition to something new and different. That evokes separation anxiety for both parents and kids, even in older kids,” Saltz said.\n\nWatching an unfolding tragedy of this magnitude can trigger what Saltz calls “irrational, catastrophic fears” and deep feelings of helplessness — and just at the moment when families across the country are dropping off camp trunks or waiting for messages home.\n\nNo matter how unprecedented an incident, hearing about it makes it feel as if it’s likely happen again, “certainly in the immediate aftermath,” Saltz said. “It’s important to remember it’s bizarrely rare.”\n\nThe deadly flooding occurred after drought conditions and a massive amount of rain — another example ofextreme weather eventsthat are becoming more frequent amid rising global temperatures.\n\n“It adds this element of helplessness — the same kind of helplessness, for example, that many people feel about guns and school shootings,” Saltz said. “And so that feeling of being stuck adds to that distressing, helpless feeling, not being in control.”\n\nBob Ditter, a clinical social worker for the American Camp Association, said stories fromCamp Mystic alumnireflect a place that has been around for nearly 100 years and where people feel safe and a strong sense of belonging.\n\n“The reason that this has resonated with so many people is the specter of having our safe, happy space swept away from us is just unimaginable,” he said.\n\nDr. Leslie Paris, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia who studies American childhood, said that camps have historically been treated as safe havens from crime and disease. They encourage tradition and nostalgia, too, drawing generations of parents “eager to provide similar opportunities to their own children.”\n\nGoing to camp has never been perfectly safe. Deadly drownings, disease outbreaks, and lightning strikes have happened through the generations, but not so widely or frequently that they drove campers away.\n\n“The scale of the tragedy at Camp Mystic is particularly significant,” Paris said. “I think that we are collectively shocked because these are deaths so deeply out of order, so fundamentally wrong.”\n\nParents and caregivers should acknowledge their fears but resist the temptation to avoid anxiety or discomfort. They can do their due diligence about safety, including asking camps about theiremergency plansand how they can communicate with their children.\n\nBut they’ll have to accept that some degree of uncertainty will always exist. Parents acknowledging and tolerating that uncertainty is a model for their children, Saltz said.\n\n“You’re operating as a family. There are a million things in life that you cannot do if you can’t tolerate any risk at all,” Saltz said. “You can’t cross the street, you can’t fly to a vacation. Everything has some modicum [of uncertainty] so it is important in the world of resilience, experience, managing new tasks, to be able to tolerate that.”\n\nFor parents with anxious children, Saltz suggests leaving the news out of family discussions or letters to camp.\n\n“There’s no reason for a child in a camp in Vermont to be hearing about this camp in Texas,” she said. “In pre-internet days when camps were around, they wouldn’t have.”\n\nStill, word will spread. And when it does, “the most important thing to do is to point out how rare it is to tell them that they can absolutely talk with you about it,” Saltz said. “They can ask you any questions. You may not know the answers, but you’ll try to find out for them.”\n\nDitter from the American Camp Association said that parents should emphasize “that there’s a difference between something that has happened to somebody else that resonates with us, but that hasn’t happened to us. It’s our empathy that makes us frightened and makes us feel these things deeply. In fact, we even have a name for it. We call it empathic distress.”\n\nSaltz emphasizes that neither parents nor children should immerse themselves in the news.\n\n“I would advise parents who have learned about the story not to keep watching the news story over and over again,” she said. “There’s no benefit, but there is repeated triggering.”\n\nEven if it feels uncomfortable, children with mild anxiety disorder, mood issues or separation anxiety still benefit from taking risks and developing away from the normal routines of home.\n\nBut sleepaway camp may not be for everyone, including children with a panic or mood disorder, phobia, or who have experienced a recent tragedy or trauma.\n\n“If you send them somewhere where they can’t get any treatment, you may be doing them a disservice,” Saltz said.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Opinion - Trump put a target on the University of Virginia — now its president is gone",
    "News_text":"The Trump administration has dramatically escalated itswar on higher education, using the threat of withholding federal funding toforce the resignation of Jim Ryan, the University of Virginia’s president of seven years.\n\nThe purported crime warranting this unprecedented demand? Not moving quickly enough to roll back the decades of progress the school has made in becoming a more diverse and welcoming environment to students, faculty and staff of all backgrounds.\n\nThe ninth president in the university’s history, Ryan has been an effective and highly regarded leader, shepherding the university through challenges and tragedies with a steady hand. Under his leadership,research fundingandapplicationsto the university have hit record highs, and it has maintained thehighest graduation ratesof any public university.\n\nToday, UVA is rankedNo.1 in the nation for free speechby the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, andNo. 2 for best value among public universities, according to the Princeton Review. Ryan has made open dialogue about how to make the university better a hallmark of his presidency, welcoming good-faith input from across the ideological spectrum.\n\nThis legacy of thoughtful and effective leadership is now reportedly being muscled aside by a bad-faith act of stunning executive overreach. We must be clear-eyed about what it is to coerce an ouster under threat of financial ruin — it is an assault not only on UVA, but on the very principles of academic freedom, institutional autonomy and democratic governance.\n\nThere is no justifiable basis for this action. The move appears to be rooted in President Trump’s Januaryexecutive orderseeking to purge diversity, equity and inclusion programs from public and private institutions across the country. The underlying demand, of course, is itself a staggering act of presidential overreach. Executive orders are not laws, and they are not royal decrees. They are strongly worded suggestions with force that stops at the borders of the executive branch. They are in no way intended to compel private or state entities to reorder themselves according to the preferences or whims of any one president.\n\nYet now the Justice Department seeks to usurp the independence and governance of both UVA and the Commonwealth that oversees it. In so doing, it is relying on a perverse reading of the laws of our country that treats any gesture toward a more inclusive society as ipso facto illegal, ignoring the plain meaning of American civil rights statutes and decades of case law. And in the process of pursuing its own rogue interpretation of those laws, the Justice Department is placing an overtly unconstitutional curb on both free expression and state sovereignty.\n\nThis is also a profoundly troubling sign the Trump administration is willing to sabotage American global leadership in pursuit of narrow political goals. Federal funds for higher education are not gifts or acts of charity. They are disbursed through grants and contracts that institutions often earn through fiercely competitive processes that have for decades played a central role in making American colleges and universities the envy of the world in research and academics. There could be few actions more short-sighted and self-defeating for the future of the country than taking a sledgehammer to higher education to flex power and impose a top-down ideology. Yet that is precisely what the Justice Department seeks to do here.\n\nIn the face of this threat, it is incumbent on leaders in Congress and in the Commonwealth of Virginia to stand up and speak. Regardless of political persuasion, Virginians and the American people should not and cannot tolerate any administration unconstitutionally seeking to bend the institutions that have made the country great to its will and ideology.\n\nGov. Glenn Youngkin (R), the university’s Board of Visitors, and lawmakers across Virginia and the country must make it absolutely clear that it is unacceptable for American taxpayers’ money to be used as a cudgel or bargaining chip to cow our institutions into obeisance. As has already been seen through the Trump administration’s actionstargeting other universities, failure to forcefully push back will only fuel more and more overreach.\n\nIn the earliest days of the republic, Thomas Jefferson wrote in hisNotes on the State of Virginiathat “public money and public liberty,” intended to be spread across the branches of government “but found inadvertently to be in the hands of one only, will soon be discovered to be sources of wealth and dominion to those who hold them.” Cautioning the Virginia General Assembly to “look forward to a time” when corruption “will have seized the heads of government,” Jefferson continued: “The time to guard against corruption and tyranny is before they shall have gotten hold of us. It is better to keep the wolf out of the fold, than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons after he shall have entered.”\n\nThe wolf is now at the door of the university that Jefferson founded. Those with the power to keep it out of the fold must speak now.\n\nAnn Brown, who was a member of the University of Virginia’s first undergraduate co-ed class and a UVA law graduate, practiced commercial finance law for 45 years. Chris Ford, who graduated from Virginia’s Engineering School in 1987, has practiced commercial transactional law for major firms for over 30 years.

    "News_title":"Federal forecast concerns surface in Texas’ deadly flooding debate",
    "News_text":"KERR COUNTY, Texas (KXAN) — State and local officials are calling out federal forecasters amid deadly flooding in the Texas Hill Country over the extended Fourth of July weekend. The criticism comes, as funding cuts and staff shortages plague the National Weather Service and other emergency management agencies nationwide.\n\nTexas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd told reporters Friday original forecasts from the National Weather Service predicted 4 to 8 inches of rain in that area, “but the amount of rain that fell in this specific location was never in any of those forecasts.”\n\n“Listen, everybody got the forecast from the National Weather Service, right?” Kidd said. “You all got it, you’re all in media, you got that forecast. It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw.”\n\nConflicting officials, social posts leave evacuation delay questions in Kerr County flooding\n\nKidd added TDEM “worked with our own meteorologist to finetune that weather statement” but did not elaborate on any updated interpretation that would have led to more urgent warnings for evacuations.\n\nThe area actually received a much more significant amount of rain that night, with NWS observed totals exceeding 10 inches just west of Kerrville, near where dozens were killed or remain missing – includingseveral children at a summer camp.\n\nLocalized LCRA rainfall totalsin the region have exceeded 18 inches in some places.\n\nThe Guadalupe River in Kerrville measured just under a foot on Thursday, leading up to midnight. At about 4 a.m. Friday, the river rose over 30 feet in less than two hours,according USGS data.\n\nOn Friday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also said during a separate press event that TDEM Region 6 Assistant Chief Jay Hall “personally contacted the judges and mayors in that area and notified them all of potential flooding.” KXAN has requested record of that communication to verify that statement and its level of urgency.\n\n“Yesterday morning, the message was sent,” Patrick added. “It is up to the local counties and mayors under the law to evacuate if they feel a need. That information was passed along.”\n\nNWS issued a flash flood warning at 1:14 a.m. Friday for a portion of Kerr County – where the majority of flood-related deaths have been reported. But it would be at least four hours before any county or city government entity posted directions to evacuate on social media.\n\nCity and county officials have yet to fully explain the timing of their Facebook posts surrounding the height of the flood or other ways they might have notified people near the water. Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring, Jr., said Saturday the city had done an “admirable” job making sure all information was available to the public. KXAN is awaiting responses after requesting records of communication between city, county and state officials to better understand decisions regarding their public warnings.\n\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly has claimed officials “didn’t know this flood was coming.”\n\n“This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States, and we deal with floods on a regular basis – when it rains, we get water,” Kelly said to reporters Friday. “We had no reason to believe this was going to be anything like what has happened here, none whatsoever.”\n\nKerrville City Manager Dalton Rice reiterated that apparent lack of awareness, telling the media Friday: “This rain event sat on top of that and dumped more rain than what was forecasted.”\n\nFollowing those statements, the NWS provided additional details on its notification timeline for the Kerr County flood, including:\n\nThe National Water Center Flood Hazard Outlook issued on Thursday morning indicated an expansion of flash flood potential to include Kerrville and surrounding areas.\n\nA flood watch was issued by the NWS Austin\/San Antonio office at 1:18 p.m. on Thursday, in effect through Friday morning.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center issued three Mesoscale Precipitation Discussions for the excessive rainfall event as early as 6:10 p.m. Thursday indicating the potential for flash flooding.\n\nThe National Water Center Area Hydrologic Discussion #144 at 6:22 p.m. on Thursday messaged locally considerable flood wording for areas north and west of San Antonio, including Kerrville.\n\nAt 1:14 a.m. Friday, a flash flood warning with a considerable tag (which denotes high-damage threats and will automatically trigger Wireless Emergency Alerts on enabled mobile devices and over NOAA Weather Radio) was issued for Kerr County.\n\nThe flash flood warning was upgraded to a flash flood emergency for southcentral Kerr County as early as 4:03 a.m. Friday.\n\nThe 5:00 a.m. National Water Center Area Hydrologic Discussion #146 on Friday included concern for widespread considerable flooding through the day. The Flood Hazard Outlook was also upgraded to considerable and catastrophic.\n\nA flash flood emergency was issued for the Guadalupe River at 5:34 a.m.\n\nKXAN is awaiting additional responses from the NWS on that timeline. KXAN also requested comments from Kidd and from NWS Austin\/San Antonio Meteorologist in Charge Pat Vesper regarding how recent federal funding cuts might have impacted weather forecasting abilities in Texas.\n\nTDEM responded but did not answer KXAN’s questions or indicate when Kidd would be available to speak directly about those issues. An NWS spokesperson said Vesper’s office “is focused on forecast operations right now, as flash flooding is ongoing.”\n\nWhile state and local officials have not publicly – nor outright – blamed the Trump Administration’s financial decisions for any possible forecasting issues, public accusations on social media and elsewhere point to their timing during severe weather season.\n\nFor instance, directly under Vesper at the local NWS office is a key position – warning coordination meteorologist (WCM) – that has remained vacant since April. The role was most recently held by longtime employee Paul Yura, who took an early retirement package offered to agency workers as the administration worked to reduce the budget and personnel number at the NWS and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nYura, who KXAN recently reported spent more than half of his 32-year career at the local NWS office, gained tremendous experience understanding local weather patterns while ensuring timely warnings get disseminated to the public in a multitude of ways. The importance of his role as WCM cannot be understated.\n\n‘Today will be a hard day’: Search ongoing for missing kids, adults in Kerrville\n\nEnsuring ample and timely warning to Central Texas counties was among the chief responsibilities. According to NOAA, “The WCM coordinates the warning function of the office with the outside world. This would include heading the Skywarn Program, conducting spotter training and being a voice to the local media for the office.”\n\nFollowing the Kerr County flood, KXAN reached out to Yura – who referenced a hiring freeze in his retirement message to the media – but he referred questions to an NWS public affairs official.\n\nAlong with Yura’s job, five other vacancies in the local NWS office have stacked up, according to its online staff roster and the NWS Employees Organization. Those include two meteorologists, two technology staff members and a science officer. The office has 26 employees when fully staffed.\n\nThe administration made cuts to the federal workforce an early priority in Trump’s second presidential term this year, and those reductions extended to the NWS.\n\nIn May,NBC News reportedthe agency was working to shuffle employees to cover 150 positions that were vacated by the firings of probationary employees and early retirements of other longtime workers.\n\nSome forecasting offices were left without overnight service, though no Texas offices were mentioned among those.\n\nTom Fahy, the NWSEO legislative director, thentold NBCthe staff cuts could increase risk and damage the agency’s ability to respond to a disaster.\n\nFahy told KXAN on Saturday the Central Texas flooding “was indeed a flash precipitation event,” leading to massive rainfall – something the local NWS office still had “adequate staffing and resources” to handle, despite its vacancies.\n\n“They issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,” he said, also referencing flood watches “out well in advance” the day before the waters rose.\n\nIn early June, the NWS was seeking to hire at least 126 people across the country, including meteorologists, following previous staff cuts,The Hill reported. A NOAA spokesperson told the outlet the NWS would be conducting “short term temporary duty assignments” and providing “reassignment opportunity notices” to fill field offices with the “greatest operational needs.”\n\nThe NWS Austin\/San Antonio Weather Forecast Office currently has a 15% vacancy rate for meteorologists. The office’s total vacancy rate was 12% at the beginning of the year, but that increased to 23% by the end of April when employees took buyouts, Fahy confirmed to KXAN.\n\nPresident Trump posted on Truth Social he is “working with State and Local Officials on the ground in Texas in response to the tragic flooding,” ahead of U.S. Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemvisit to represent the administration in Kerrville Saturday.\n\nDuring a press conference after surveying the area, Noem told reporters the amount of rain in this flooding event was “unprecedented,” underscoring the reason Trump is working to “fix” aging technology within NOAA.\n\n“I do carry your concerns back to the federal government and back to President Trump,” she said, acknowledging the need for upgraded technology to give “families have as much warning as possible.”\n\nCentral Texas and the Hill Country are broadly known for major floods. With one of the highest risks for flash flooding in the country, the area has earned the nickname “flash flood alley,”according to LCRA.\n\nThis weekend’s tragedy isn’t the first.\n\nIn 1987, a flood hit the Guadalupe River, pushing the waterway up 29 feet and catching a church camp bus,according to the NWS. The bus, which was being used to evacuate dozens of children, was swept away and 10 children were killed.\n\nAgain, in 1998, flooding struck the region. On Oct. 17 and 18 that year a storm dropped roughly 30 inches of rain near San Marcos. Homes along the Guadalupe River near Canyon Lake and down to Seguin were washed off their foundations,NWS reported.\n\nCloser to Austin, the Blanco River experienced catastrophic flooding in 2015 during theMemorial Day holiday weekend. Houses and bridges were washed away, and 13 people were killed across the region.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

A top admiral told Business Insider the unprecedented port call sent a message to American foes.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind visit to the Nordic island nation by the Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Newport News came as the US and NATO allies look with increasing concern at thegrowing Russian military activityacross the Arctic and High North.\n\nAdm. Stuart Munsch, the commander of US Naval Forces Europe-Africa, said there's value in having different options throughout the region whereAmerican submarinescan make port visits.\n\nSpeaking with BI in a phone interview from Iceland's capital, Reykjavík, Munsch said the submarine port call was \"also important for the strategic signal it sends to adversaries about our presence in the area\" and for the reassurance it provides to US allies.\n\nThe US views Iceland as a centerpiece within itsArctic strategybecause of its strategic location. The country joined NATO as a founding member in 1949, but unlike other members of the alliance, it doesn't have a military. It did, however, host Western troops during the Cold War, including a major American presence.\n\n\"The US, for many decades, maintained a naval air base here,\" and relied on assets stationed in the country \"to track Soviet submarine operations, then Russian submarine operations,\" the admiral said of Iceland.\n\nMunsch said that \"it's important to us to have additional options for where we can make strong port calls\" and maintain a strong presence in the region that stretches from Greenland to Iceland and the United Kingdom. That's a key point made in the Pentagon's 2024 Arctic strategy.\n\nWhile the strategy outlines Russia's increasingmilitary and economic interestin the Arctic, it also draws attention toChina's effortsto expand its influence in the region. The US sees Iceland as a key element of its security and deterrence efforts, as these two US rivals seek to project power into the strategic area.\n\nErin Sawyer, the chargé d'affaires at the US Embassy in Iceland, said in astatementon Wednesday that Washington and Reykjavik \"maintain the shared goal of low tension in the Arctic, with full awareness of Russia's efforts to build its military presence in the region.\"\n\nThe Navy has been working with the Icelandic government for years, but mainly from a distance. For instance, anAmerican vesselwould pull up off the coast and maybe change out personnel or bring aboard supplies.\n\nIn 2023, Iceland welcomed the first US nuclear-powered sub into its territorial waters. But Newport News' arrival in port this week — tied up to a pier and sending crew members ashore — marks a new moment in the relationship, Munsch said.\n\nJust over 40 Los Angeles-class submarines are in active service, making up a significant portion of the Navy's fast-attack submarine fleet. Newer Virginia-class vessels have, however, taken on an increasingly central role. The USS Newport News, a late-1980s Los Angeles-class sub, is armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and torpedoes and has conducted missions around the globe.\n\nUS undersea capabilities are considered a cornerstone of American naval power. \"The submarine force has been operating globally for many decades now,\" Munsch said, \"and there's really no region that we have ever ceded to anyone else.\"\n\nRead the original article onBusiness Insider",

They have not made any confirmed advances.\n\nDonetsk: Russian forces continued their offensive operations in the Siversk direction as of July 8, but had not advanced. Here, the overarching Russian objectives remain the capture of the entirety of the Donetsk region, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas, and possibly an advance into the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nZaporizhzhia: Russian forces continued their offensive operations in this region as of July 8. A deputy commander for a Ukrainian battalion operating in the Zaporizhia direction reported on July 7 that Russian forces were attacking in groups of three to four soldiers, usually without equipment but sometimes with motorcycles and buggies.\n\nKherson: Neither Ukrainian nor Russian sources reported any ground activity in the Kherson direction on July 8.\n\nA remarkable battlefield account purportedly from a Russian soldier (serving in a penal battalion) was published on a pro-Kremlin Telegram account, after they were posted as missing in action. The account takes the form of a letter, addressed to President Putin, outlining various grievances, including the equipment his unit was provided with. He writes:\n\n“I’m not a career military man, and not an officer, so maybe I don’t understand something, but I’ve always thought that assault is a complex offensive operation, which includes aviation, artillery, and intelligence support. What do I see with my own eyes? We are put in a UAZ or Niva without a roof, or on motorcycles, even on horses, and sent on the road in groups of two to three or six to eight people. After one kilometer, we are starting to get attacked by drones, artillery, and mortars, while we still have to drive for another seven kilometers. Naturally, there is no artillery preparation for suppressing enemy artillery or countering dozens of deadly drones.

    "News_title":"\"Big, beautiful bill\" gives ICE unprecedented funds to ramp up deportations",
    "News_text":"The \"big, beautiful bill\"signed into lawby President Trump last week will allow him to dramatically expand his immigration crackdown, giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement an unprecedented pool of funding to bolster its efforts to arrest and deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe money allocated by the law amounts to the largest infusion of funds Congress has given the federal government for immigration enforcement, at a time when the Trump administration has vowed to oversee a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions.\n\nOverall, the Republican-led Congress set aside roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts through the legislation, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE, making it by far the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.\n\n\"The bill will supercharge immigration enforcement,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.\n\nHere's a look at what the new funds will be used for:\n\n$45 billion for ICE's detention system\n\nThe law gives ICE $45 billion to expand its already sprawling detention system over the next four years, letting officials use the money to hold both single adults and families with children facing deportation.\n\nBased on cost estimates, the money could allow ICE to hold more than 100,000 detainees at any given time, roughly doubling the current capacity. On Wednesday morning, ICE was holding just over 58,000 individuals in its detention network, which was previously funded for 41,500 beds, according to internal agency data obtained by CBS News.\n\nICE's detention network mainly consists of facilities operated by for-profit prison companies and county jails. The Trump administration has also been exploring using military facilities in the U.S. to hold detainees before they are deported. The naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been housing some ICE detainees since February.\n\n$30 billion for ICE's arrest and deportation efforts\n\nICE is also receiving nearly $30 billion in additional money to fund every single stage of the deportation process.\n\nCongress said ICE can use the money to hire additional deportation officers and other staff; retain current personnel through bonuses; increase transportation assets supporting deportation efforts; and expand and facilitate agreements that allow state and local officials to enforce federal immigration laws.\n\nThe funds can also be used to modernize ICE's fleet of deportation planes and hire more agency prosecutors whose job it is to persuade immigration judges that unauthorized immigrants should be deported.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said the money could pave the way for ICE to hire 10,000 deportation officers. The agency currently has fewer than 6,000 officers in its deportation branch, though the Trump administration has tasked other federal law enforcement agencies, like the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, to support immigration arrests throughout the country.\n\nTens of billions of dollars for other immigration and border efforts\n\nThe \"big, beautiful bill\" allocates tens of billions of dollars for other types of immigration-related enforcement, including along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMore than $46 billion is allocated for Customs and Border Protection to build walls, barriers and related projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. The agency received an additional $12 billion to fund Border Patrol agent vehicles, facilities, training, hiring and bonuses.\n\nWhile the money is allocated for CBP, the Trump administration has been using hundreds of Border Patrol agents in the interior of the country to help ICE arrest unauthorized immigrants inplaces like Los Angeles. That deployment has come amid historically low levels of illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe law also gives the Department of Homeland Security a catch-all pool of $10 billion to support its \"mission to safeguard the borders of the United States.\" Another $13.5 billion was set aside to reimburse states for their immigration enforcement and border security actions, including for efforts under the Biden administration.\n\nThat money for states could allow Texas to be paid back for Operation Lone Star, under which the state deployed National Guardsmen to fortify the southern border and bussed thousands of migrants to Democratic-led cities. It could also fund actions taken by states like Florida to aid the Trump administration's deportation campaign by deputizing state officials as immigration agents and offering facilities, like the so-called \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" to hold detainees awaiting deportation.\n\nICE heads hails funds; but critics have concerns\n\nIn a statement, Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, hailed passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\"\n\n\"The unprecedented funding for ICE will enable my hard-working officers and agents to continue making America safe again by identifying, arresting and removing criminal aliens from our communities,\" Lyons said.\n\nBut critics of the administration have denounced Republican lawmakers for giving billions of dollars to an agency under fire in many parts of the country over concerns that its enforcement operations have been too aggressive and indiscriminate.\n\nAndrea Flores, a former Biden administration immigration official, warned that the money given to ICE would lead to dire humanitarian, legal and economic consequences, including \"inhumane\" conditions at detention facilities.\n\n\"The administration now has the resources it needs to carry out more deportations than we have ever seen in modern history,\" said Flores, who now serves as a vice president at FWD.US, a bipartisan group that supports liberal immigration policies.\n\nSocial media content creator shows his hustle\n\nUdemy Is Powering Enterprise AI Transformation Through Skills\n\nDebate over Trump plan to increase logging on federal lands",

    "News_title":"Jackson County voters sue to stop Frank White, election boards from delaying recall",
    "News_text":"As Jackson County officials go back and forth debating who gets to schedule a looming vote torecall County Executive Frank White, Jr.— and when they get to do it — a new bipartisan lawsuit seeks to block White, a Democrat, from interfering with the timeline of the vote.\n\nThe lawsuit — brought by former chairs of both the Democratic and Republican parties of Jackson County and two other county residents — seeks a court order upholding theproposed August 26 datefor a recall election.\n\nIt argues that the county charter mandates that a recall vote take place no later than 60 days after the necessary number of signatures are submitted to the relevant election boards.\n\nThe lawsuit asserts that — regardless of whatcounty legislators, executives or election officialssay or do about it — the election’s timeline was already set the moment voterssubmitted their petitionwith enough signatures at the end of June and is now non-negotiable. It asks a county judge to tell the election boards for Jackson County and Kansas City to proceed with the vote.\n\nThe Jackson County Board of Elections declined to comment on the lawsuit or the current status of preparations for the August 26 election, citing legal advice to avoid further public statements about the recall election.\n\n“Our attorneys are reviewing the lawsuit,” Republican director Tammy Brown said.\n\nAfter months of effort from grassroots organizers and ashadowy political action group, Jackson County voters collected 43,011 valid signatures, which is 109 more than the 42,902 needed to compel a recall. Organizers submitted the signatures on June 27, and the election boards certified them three days later.\n\nThe last day a recall vote could take place per the county charter would be either August 26 based on the day the signatures were submitted, or August 29 based on the day the signatures were certified, the lawsuit reads.\n\n“It takes time to plan and conduct an election, and in this unprecedented time, the Election Boards should be given the most time to be able to plan and hold an election but it must be before August 29, 2025,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nJackson County legislators voted unanimously Monday on an ordinance set the recall election for August 26. Like White, seven of the nine legislators are Democrats.\n\nWhite has 10 days to veto the ordinance, or it becomes law. It takes six votes to override a veto.\n\nBut the lawsuit argues that the timing of the election ultimately does not depend on Monday’s ordinance and should go forward no matter what White or the legislature do.\n\nIt says that different from other kinds of elections, the county charter is clear that voters petition the county’s election boards directly to prompt a recall election and that the process should not involve the legislature or executive at all.\n\nAlong with the county charter, the lawsuit references an ordinance passed by the legislature in 2023 detailing the procedure for an election to recall the county executive. That ordinance allows recall elections to be triggered directly by election board approval of submitted signatures, the lawsuit reads.\n\nWhite said Monday that the special election could cost taxpayers $2 million and hinted at taking legal action to block the legislature’s effort to schedule the vote. He has said that an August election would violate his interpretation of the 2023 ordinance.\n\nTo justify his reasoning, White referenced a line near the end of that ordinance that reads, “If no legal election date is available within sixty days, the election will occur at the next available election after certification of the Petition.”\n\nDaRon McGee, chair of the Jackson County Legislature, issued a statement Wednesday accusing White of implementing “delaying tactics and creating imaginary conspiracies” around the recall vote process.\n\n“To delay or obstruct that vote isn’t just unnecessary—it’s a disservice to the very people we’re supposed to represent,” McGee wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by Kansas City attorney Phil LeVota, former chair of the county Democratic party, and former county Republican chair Mark Anthony Jones, along with two other residents: Fawn Collins and Jay Perry.\n\nIt names as defendants White, the county legislature, county clerk Mary Jo Spino and the Kansas City and Jackson County election boards. In a statement issued Wednesday, White accused LeVota of being motivated by revenge after White declined to create a vacancy for him in the county’s municipal court.\n\n“I declined because expanding the government to create a job for a political insider is exactly what I was elected to stop,” White wrote. “Even more concerning, Mr. LeVota has been openly lobbying legislators to name him interim County Executive if a recall succeeds, and at the same time, doing the bidding of the teams in the press.”\n\nThe Star’s Mike Hendricks contributed reporting.",

    "News_title":"Turkey detains hundreds of Erdogan opponents in pursuit of 'octopus' of corruption",
    "News_text":"(Amends paragraph 4 to state the government rejects not refutes the CHP's argument)\n\nANKARA (Reuters) -Tayyip Erdogan's main political opponents have faced an unprecedented crackdown that has seen more than 500 detained in just nine months, according to a Reuters review of a sprawling investigation that has accelerated dramatically in recent days.\n\nTurkey's president says the probe tackles what he calls a corrupt network that is like \"an octopus whose arms stretch to other parts of Turkey and abroad.\"\n\nThe investigation, which began in Istanbul but has spread across the country, has targetted only municipalities run by the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, the party of modern Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.\n\nThe CHP denies the corruption allegations and calls them a naked attempt to eliminate a democratic alternative for Turks, a charge the government rejects.\n\nThe crackdown tightens Erdogan's two-decade grip on power at a time that Turkey's influence in the Middle East and Europe has grown. For this reason, diplomats and analysts say, it has garnered only muted criticism from Western allies as a threat to democracy even as street protests erupted in the spring.\n\nAccording to the review of legal filings and state disclosures, 14 elected CHP mayors, including Istanbul's Ekrem Imamoglu - Erdogan's main rival - and more than 200 party members or local officials have been jailed pending trial.\n\nNot since a series of coups in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s have such high-profile political leaders been removed from office on the basis of as yet unpublished evidence, which suspects' lawyers dismiss as fabricated.\n\n\"These investigations are being used as a tool for political attrition rather than objective investigation of concrete events,\" said Ertugrul Gunay, a former culture and tourism minister in Erdogan's cabinets between 2007 and 2013.\n\nHe resigned from the ruling AK Party (AKP) after thousands of Turks were arrested over the anti-government Gezi Park protests of 2013. The latest legal drive, though smaller in scale, has gone further in targetting a would-be future government, riding high in the polls.\n\nIt reflects \"anxiety and panic that (Erdogan's) ruling party has for the next elections,\" Gunay told Reuters.\n\nErdogan and his ministers have repeatedly rejected as unfounded critics' accusations of judicial interference, saying the independent courts need time to sort through evidence.\n\nThey say such criticism reflects an opposition party reckoning with its illegal practices and internal strife, and undermines public trust.\n\n\"This is a legal process, not a political one. We are not involved in any aspect of this process,\" Erdogan told his AKP MPs in parliament on Wednesday.\n\nMORE THAN 220 IMPRISONED\n\nAt the centre of the investigation is Imamoglu, mayor of Istanbul's 17 million people, who was jailed in March pending a court hearing on corruption charges he denies.\n\nHe is the CHP presidential candidate in any future election, and his arrest sparked the biggest protests since Gezi and a sharp lira selloff, both of which have since abated.\n\nBut beyond Imamoglu - who from behind bars still leads Erdogan in some polls - the Reuters review found that more than 500 people were detained and questioned since the probe began in October last year, including at least 202 since last week alone.\n\nOf those, more than 220 were imprisoned or put under house arrest, according to the review, which was based in part on a compilation of reports by state-run Anadolu Agency.\n\nErdogan's office and the Justice Ministry did not respond this week to a detailed request for a tally of detentions and arrests, and for a comment on the Reuters review's findings.\n\nReuters further found that at least 36 people, mostly those in the private sector doing business with municipalities, provided a second statement to prosecutors from prison under the \"effective repentance\" provision of Turkish law - after which 32 of them were released from prison under judicial control measures.\n\nThese statements have identified more suspects, disclosures from prosecutors and others show.\n\nSince Tuesday last week the investigation has spread to Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city, as well as Antalya, Adana and Adiyaman - all won by the centrist CHP over Erdogan's ruling conservative AKP in last year's March municipal elections, the party's biggest ever electoral defeat.\n\nTENTACLES\n\nErdogan has in recent months predicted, correctly, that more charges and detentions were to come, further stoking concerns over political interference.\n\nDays after his octopus comment in May, five district mayors from Istanbul and Adana were arrested on corruption charges.\n\nErdogan's office and the Justice Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on critics' claims that authorities' public comments about the probe harm judicial independence, and that it unfairly targets only the CHP for political gain.\n\nTurkey's Directorate of Communications released a list of past AKP mayors who were convicted on similar charges in separate probes, saying claims that the CHP is exclusively targetted are \"entirely unfounded\".\n\nMost of those listed were investigated after leaving office and were not jailed pending trial.\n\nThe Reuters review of the latest probe shows no legal actions were taken in the 14 of Istanbul's 39 districts run by the AKP.\n\nMehmet Pehlivan, Imamoglu's lawyer who was also jailed last month on criminal-membership charges he denies, told Reuters from prison that the investigation seeks for the first time to criminalise the right to practice law and to a legal defence.\n\nHe said the mayor faces \"not a single concrete piece of evidence\".\n\nProsecutors have not yet issued indictments.\n\nIn one window into the probe, a 121-page transcript of police questioning seen by Reuters shows that Imamoglu faced one claim that he colluded with a group of men who allegedly met at a cafe to discuss bribe payments.\n\nPolice asked how his phone connected to the same cellular tower as those of the men at least 150 times, the documents show. He responded that his home at the time was close to the cafe so his phone would naturally use the same tower.\n\nA spokesman for the prosecutor did not immediately comment on the police questioning.\n\nThe CHP has rejected all corruption allegations against its municipal officials but has said it will investigate after Turkey's TRT state broadcaster released footage of the deputy mayor of Manavgat, in the southern Antalya province, allegedly accepting bribes.\n\nFUTURE ELECTION\n\nTurkey has in the past seen waves of mass arrests of pro-Kurdish leaders, civil society members, military officers and outlawed groups, especially during Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian tenure.\n\nThe CHP had been relatively spared in the Erdogan era, in which it lost a string of elections to his AKP since 2002.\n\nThough the next presidential vote is not scheduled until 2028, it will need to come sooner if Erdogan wants to run again. He could also seek to amend the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nThe CHP mayors, including 14 in jail and one under house arrest, all deny the corruption, bribery and terrorism-related charges for which they await a court decision. Some have been suspended from duty.\n\nCHP Chairman Ozgur Ozel said the mayors \"have fallen prisoner to this coup against Ataturk's party\" in a speech on Sunday, that itself prompted a separate probe on charges including insulting the president.\n\n(Reporting by Huseyin Hayatsever and Jonathan Spicer; Additional reporting by Ece Toksabay in Ankara and David Gauthier-Villars in Istanbul; Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

But they said since Tuesday’s flooding was isolated to one area of town, those sirens were not used.\n\n“So as you can tell it came on pretty sudden,” said Mayor Lynn Crawford, Village of Ruidoso.\n\nTuesday 8 a.m., Ruidoso residents were sent an alert on their phone from the National Weather Service, warning them of flash flooding later that day.\n\nBut, residents have gotten used to seeing these alerts over and over again, all summer long. “We have so many issues that unfortunately sometimes when we all hear those alerts, we ignore them,” said Crawford.\n\nThat’s why the village said they have a multi-layered alert system in place.\n\nResidents and visitors can also “Opt-in” to the Call Me Ruidoso System,’ where alerts come from local agencies to your cell phone, on top of the integrated public alert system or IPAS, sending alerts straight to your phone.\n\nHere’s a timeline of when those alerts were sent Tuesday.\n\n8:00 a.m. – The National Weather Service sent out an alert to cell phones.\n\n2:15 p.m. – Another alert from the National Weather Service was sent to cellphones, saying flash flooding was expected to begin shortly affecting areas along the Rio Ruidoso and those downstream of the Ruidoso Downs.\n\n2:47 p.m. – Another National Weather Service alert was sent, upgrading the warning to an emergency. This alert ordered residents to seek higher ground.The Lincoln county office of emergency services also put out an alert warning flash flooding was imminent in the cedar creek area.\n\n3:00 p.m. – Two more alerts went out from the weather service and Ruidoso’s Office of Emergency Management (OEM) saying flash flooding had been observed along the Rio Ruidoso.\n\n3:30 p.m. – A US Geological Survey gauge along the Rio Ruidoso, recorded a water level increase from one and a half feet to nearly six feet. Another alert from Lincoln County Emergency Officials was sent to cellphones in the Ruidoso Downs area.\n\n3:55 p.m. – That same gauge shows the Rio Ruidoso rise to more than 20 feet.\n\n“We had public works, we had fire and we had police and parks and rec folks going along the Rio Ruidoso and evacuating communities as the wall of water was heading this way,” said Eric Queller, Emergency Manager with OEM.\n\nAnd, if people still hadn’t left their homes, response teams also went door-to-door along the Rio Ruidoso. “We did not have accurate data in terms of actual populations moving. There was no evacuation orders given, there were just ‘move to higher ground’ orders,” said Queller.\n\nBut around 65 people didn’t follow the warnings and had to be rescued. The mayor said it was unprecedented flooding that they’ll learn from.\n\n“So it’s not just that we’re relying on the alerts to let people know ‘you have to get out’. We understand that some people have alert fatigue,” said Michael Martinez, Deputy Village of Ruidoso Manager.\n\nThe Village of Ruidoso is urging residents look out for phone alerts and to get to higher ground as more weather is expected to come. They are also reminding residents that burn scar flooding is expected to impact the village for at least the next three to five years.\n\nRuidoso is also encouraging residents to opt in to their ‘Call me Ruidoso’ alert system.

    "News_title":"‘The NHS is crying out for nurses, so why won’t they hire us?’",
    "News_text":"As a little girl, Eleanor Pattison dreamt ofbecoming a nurse. “I’m a caring person and I enjoy looking after my family and three brothers,” says Pattison, 22. “My grandmother was a nurse, and I couldn’t wait to follow in her footsteps. I’ve always known this was where my heart was at.”\n\nPattison did work experience at the Cynthia Spencer Hospice in Northampton during the second year of her degree. “I loved it,” she says. “It was very moving to provide people with the best possible experience at the end of their lives.”\n\nBut now, at the end of a demanding three-year course in adult nursing, Pattison finds herself without a job – and with no immediate prospect of one.\n\n“Earlier this term, the university told us there was a recruitment freeze on jobs at band 5, which is where graduate nurses start,” says Pattison. “I had a meeting with my mentor in the spring: she told me that this was because ofNHSbudgets and that I should ‘hang in there’.\n\n“But for what? We’ve all gone into thisto care for people and to be compassionate, but we aren’t being met with the same attitude by our employers.”\n\nOf the 140 students in herUniversity of NorthamptonWhatsApp group, says Pattison, not one of them has a job yet. They join thousands of graduating nurses from around the country who find themselves in this unprecedented position – all the more baffling as it’s against a backdrop of staff shortages and growing NHS waiting lists.\n\nThe shortage of jobs comes asmany trusts are facing financial pressures, thus reducing or even halting recruitment. Patricia Marquis is the executive director of RCN (Royal College of Nursing) England and a former specialist orthopaedic nurse. “The procedure used to be that nurses were guaranteed a job at the end of their training and were given a list of positions to choose from,” she says.\n\n“But this has changed. Finances are tighter and so there are recruitment freezes: when a nurse moves on, their vacancy isn’t filled. Some trusts over-recruited last year because they knewnurses were leaving the NHS, so we are still feeling the knock-on from that.”\n\nAt the RCN Congress held in Liverpool in May, student ambassadors were sharing their stories about being “met with silence” during their job searches. “This isn’t an isolated experience; it’s becoming the norm,” said Alex Knight, an RCN student ambassador. “There are simply no jobs.”\n\nKnight revealed that some graduating nurses are being forced to find work in coffee shops.\n\nEven junior assistant roles are being affected. Millie Holley, 21, from Taunton in Somerset, is in the final year of her nursing foundation degree, which will qualify her for band 4 nursing jobs. “After two tough years on this course, I assumed I would leave with employment,” she says. “But if you look on the intranet, there isn’t a single job for my nursing band.\n\n“The Somerset Foundation Trust haven’t given us a reason, but the lack of support is disappointing and feels personal,” Holley continues. “I’ve really started feeling upset, and led on. I’d like to say to the Government: we’ve done all this training with nothing at the end. What are we supposed to do with it? It’s not like we don’t want to work. Why is this happening?”\n\nAccording to Marquis, there was also a lot of anxiety among college leavers in 2024. “Most of that cohort eventually got jobs,” she says. “But I’m sorry to say that this year will probably be different.”\n\nMarquis reveals that recently she visited the NHS website for a “snapshot” and saw there were only 500 jobs for 20,000 graduating nurses. “I have to admit I was shocked,” she says.\n\n&ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;The situation has been exacerbated bythe announcement last month that the Government is cutting funding for nursing courses– a move that risks undermining its pledge to end the NHS’sreliance on foreign workers.\n\nMarquis points to a cycle of “boom and bust” within the NHS. “When I qualified in 1986, there were more jobs than there had ever been – and the year after: nothing,” she says. “Sadly, we do run the risk of some recently qualified nurses leaving the profession this year.”\n\nThe notion of a “job for life” in nursing seems to be a thing of the past. Holley first started working on a hospital reception at the age of 17. “When I told the nurses working at the clinic I fancied training to become a nurse myself, they told me to go for it,” she says. “They said I would never be without a job, that I’d be able to travel the world. But a lot has changed in four years.”\n\nSimilar difficulties have been experienced by Tabitha*, a trainee paediatric nurse who is coming to the end of her three-year training in the south-east of England.\n\n“Jobs are normally advertised on the NHS website, but there’s been a lack of ads this year,” she says. “I’ve had one interview and was meant to hear back mid-May, but there’s only been silence.\n\n“I’m now on placement in the same trust, which makes things awkward. When this finishes at the end of August, I’ve no idea what I’m going to do. I’ll have done the 2,300 hours of training that nurses have to do – what happens next? I can’t plan my future or look at housing until I’ve found a job, so I may have to move back in with my parents. A few of my friends are looking at taking a year out – maybe I’ll have to do the same.\n\n“I’ve been trained to do nursing, and this is what I want to do with my life. The fact I’m having to consider switching careers because there aren’t any jobs in nursing is absolutely heartbreaking.”\n\nIn the past, nurses and healthcare assistants without permanent jobs could do “bank” – or temporary – shifts, but even these are now being limited, or are taken by nurses from countries such as India. “People are also having to accept work below their qualification level – for example, band 7 nurses are being paid to do band 5 jobs,” says Pattison. “Our lecturers say we should continue to work voluntarily in the hope we’ll be recognised, but that doesn’t feel fair to me.”\n\nPattison is now on a placement in a stroke assessment unit. “I’m currently doing a 40-hour week, sometimes comprising four 12-and-a-half-hour shifts – I often work weekends and have little to no work-life balance,” she says. “The work is unpaid. It’s great experience and I’m learning a lot – but the work is difficult. I’m doing supervised medication rounds and helping with patient care: if someone needs help to be washed, I’m not going to say no. But really, these are tasks I should be paid for.”\n\nSo what is the solution? Marquis is working with NHS England, which she says is aware of the problem and that it needs to find answers. Retention is key. “We need proper workforce planning – not just recruiting today but for the long term: for now, five years’ time, 10 years’ time,” she says. In November last year, the RCN warned the Government thatpatient care was under threatas there was a “perfect storm” with more nurses leaving the profession and fewer joining. By the end of the next Parliament, it said, more than 11,000 nurses will have quit the Nursing and Midwifery Council register within 10 years of having gained their registration. Marquis adds: “In medicine, they don’t recruit for junior doctors, they recruit for consultants, and nursing should be the same.” Centralised recruitment, as opposed to the current set-up where each trust hires its nurses separately, would also help, she says.\n\n“Nursing training needs to be funded properly – many students leave because they can’t afford the programme and there’s no time to do a part-time job,” says Marquis. “They need a proper living grant.” She also points to the need for fuller staffing on wards, so that junior nurses are not overwhelmed. “Perhaps junior nurses should also broaden their horizons away from NHS hospital care: there are jobs in the private sector, as well as social care: I started my career in a nursing home.”\n\nNo jobs, but staff shortages: how does one square that circle? “You cannot square the circle,” says an RCN spokesman. “There are more than 26,000 vacant nursing posts in the NHS in England alone – so when a shift is short of staff, it is often filled with agency staff.” And so, cash-strapped trusts continue to be run with under-capacity nursing.\n\nNone of which will be helped by the risk of newly qualified nurses such as Pattison and Holley leaving the profession. “Nursing is an amazing job and a privilege,” says Marquis. “The world is your oyster, but we need our nurses to stay in the UK. If we lose people now, they will probably never come back and the Government really has to rush to affirmative action.”\n\nMarquis is right to be concerned. “If this situation continues, I’ll have to consider other career paths, which is heartbreaking,” says Pattison. “This is all so disheartening. I am frustrated and demotivated: after working all these hours I feel let down and defeated.\n\n“They say the NHS is crying out for nurses, but we can’t even get our first posting. We feel unseen and unheard. We need support, and no one is offering it. It’s devastating.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman says: “It is unacceptable that some nurses are experiencing difficulties securing a role after qualifying.\n\n“We are working closely with NHS England, employers and educators to improve transition into the workforce, and will publish a refreshed workforce plan later this year, to ensure the NHS has the right people in the right places with the right skills.\n\n“This Government is also investing in our nurses by delivering the second above-inflation pay increase in 10 months. That means that, for the first time ever, a nurse will earn over £30,000 as a new starter.\n\n“We can’t undo a decade and a half of neglect in less than a year, but together with NHS staff, this Government is rebuilding their pay and rebuilding our health service. Decisions about recruitment are a matter for individual NHS employers.”\n\nAn NHS spokesman says: “The NHS is working with employers, universities and regional nursing leads to ensure support is in place to help graduating nurses find a role as soon as possible – and we’d encourage any student with concerns to talk to their university, supervisor or assessor.”\n\n*Name changed to protect anonymity\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"France asks FCAS partners to ‘rethink’ work share on fighter project",
    "News_text":"PARIS — France proposed to partners Germany and Spain to “rethink” the work share on the Future Combat Air System project in order to stick to a schedule that would see a future fighter enter into service from 2040 onwards, the country’s Directorate General for Armament said.\n\nWhile the program has made significant progress, including deciding on the shape of the fighter demonstrator, it’s currently encountering difficulties, the DGA told Defense News in an emailed reply to questions. France therefore recently proposed to its partners to redesign their cooperation based on “strengthening industrial leadership,” the armaments agency said.\n\n“France, as the program’s lead nation, is proposing to its government and industrial partners that they draw lessons from the first years of cooperation in order to continue to ensure that the schedule is met and the project is successful,” the DGA said. “The principle and details of this redesigned cooperation are currently being discussed with the partners.”\n\nThe French proposal comes amid reports that plane maker Dassault Aviation isseeking a greater sharein some parts of the program. The company’s CEO Eric Trappier has said questions over governance within the project need to be sorted out before the fighter moves into phase 2, which includes building a fighter demonstrator.\n\nWhile Dassault is the lead company for the development of a new warplane within the overall combat system, Trappier hasrepeatedly complainedabout delays due to bickering over work share with partner Airbus, representing Germany and Spain for the fighter segment.\n\nThe company declined to comment on the press reports about it seeking a bigger share.\n\nAirbus officially still expects FCAS to befully operational by 2040, whereas Trappier has repeatedly said the incurred delays mean 2045 is more likely for the fighter. The DGA has previously said it expects phase 2 of FCAS to start early 2026.\n\nWith FCAS designed to ensure future air superiority in a contested environment, but also a project that will contribute to French strategic missions from 2040 onwards, “it is therefore essential that the schedule is adhered to,” the DGA said.\n\nOne of the roles of the FCAS fighter will be to carry the air-launched component of France’s nuclear deterrent, currently handled by Dassault’s Rafale jet.\n\nAirbus makes the Eurofighter that equips the German and Spanish air forces, and which doesn’t have a nuclear role.\n\nThe program has met four critical milestones, and the current difficulties are “inherent in a program of this scale and ambition,” according to the DGA, which described FCAS as a project of “unprecedented complexity.”\n\nDiscussions on revamping the FCAS cooperation don’t call into question the goals and overall balance of the project, which is a “program of equals,” the armaments directorate said.\n\nHowever, the ongoing talks will “lead to a reworking of the division of labor between each industrial player,” the DGA said. “Each player’s share of the work is not a given but will be the result of discussions between the partners.”\n\nTrappier has said he would prefer cooperation to be modeled on the French-led nEUROn project to develop a stealth drone, which involved six countries working together, with Dassault the leader.\n\nFCAS is a key program for European sovereignty in defense, and continuing the program is of strategic interest for France, which is “firmly committed” to the project, according to the DGA.\n\nFrance, Germany and Spain in December 2022 awarded Dassault Aviation, Airbus, Indra Sistemas and Eumet a €3.2 billion ($3.7 billion) contract for phase 1B of the program, covering research, technology and overall design.",

    "News_title":"Ruto Once Courted Kenya’s Youth. Now He’s Trying to Silence Them",
    "News_text":"Beginning in June 2024, Kenyans have repeatedly taken to the streets to oppose the government of President William Ruto. The immediate cause ofthe protests last yearwas a punitive tax regime imposed in the shadow of a slow-burn economic crisis. The government responded to that show of popular disapproval with the worst police violence the country has witnessed in two generations. At least 60 people were killed by the police, with some local nonprofits putting the number at 72. Since then, at least 200 people have been killed by the police during follow-up protests or in contexts related to protests, the vast majority of them younger than 35.\n\nThe most recent spiral began on June 13, with thedeath in police custodyof Albert Ojwang’, a teacher and blogger who had published accusations of corruption against the deputy inspector general of police, Eliud Lagat. Ojwang’ was arrested in his mother’s home in Homa Bay and transferred overnight almost 250 miles away to the central police station in Nairobi, where he was found dead in his cell the next day. A clumsy coverup effort by the police fell apart quickly after Ojwang’s family insisted on an independent autopsy that confirmed he had been strangled and beaten to death in the cell.\n\nProtests against Ojwang’s killing were met with unprecedented force, the latest indication that the Ruto administration will not tolerate dissent in any form. The most visible victim of that round of protest was street vendorBoniface Kariuki Mwangi, who was shot in the head at point blank range by a police officer on June 17, with the entire incident captured on camera. Mwangi was not even participating in the protest; he was selling masks to those who were. And when the police officer told him to move on, he did, only for the same officer to beckon him back and then shoot him in the head for no evident reason.\n\nThe brutal images of Mwangi’s killing could not have come at a worse moment for the Ruto administration, a week before planned protests to commemorate the first anniversary of the June 25 protests and killings last year and two weeks prior to demonstrations that take place every year in Kenya on July 7. The date—known asSaba Saba, or seven seven, in Swahili—is a significant one, marking the anniversary of popular protests in 1990 against single-party rule under then-President Daniel arap Moi, Ruto’s political mentor. Those protests helped usher in the country’s first multiparty elections in 1992, signaling the birth of Kenya’s flawed but enduring electoral democracy and have been a fixture in the calendar of civil society mobilizations ever since.\n\nTo get more in-depth news and expert analysis on global affairs from WPR,sign up for our free Daily Review newsletter.\n\nWhile the administration publicly struck a more conciliatory tone following Mwangi’s killing, both subsequent protests were met with even more violence. On June 25, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, or KNCHR, counted 19 people killed and another 400 injured by the police. So far the death toll for the July 7 protests stands at 31 people, all killed by the police.\n\nThe Ruto administration has tried to frame the protests as acts of terrorism and even an uprising, despite the fact that every single person who has been killed so far has been killed by the police. Meanwhile, the real crisis is the Ruto government’s intolerance for dissent and inability to engage with Kenyan citizens except by fiat.\n\nPrior to the June 25 protests in 2024, which were known as the #RejectFinanceBill protests for the hashtag used to help organize them, the Ruto administration went to unprecedented lengths to stifle efforts by Kenyan citizens to register their misgivings over the tax measures the bill sought to impose. In fact, the 2024 protests were the culmination of months of civic engagement byyoung peoplethat would make a true democracy proud.\n\nOutside of formal institutions and with no central organization, Kenyan youth studied the bill and educated each other about it via social media, as well as by translating its contents into a number of Kenya’s local languages and distributing tracts of it across the country. They then turned up to participate in meetings for public comment and submitted documents to the government expressing clearly why they were opposed to the bill’s provisions. In short, they did all the things that democracy-promotion initiatives over the past three decades in Kenya have been calling for and equipping them to do.\n\nYet instead of listening to them, the Ruto administration attempted to force the law through. Only then were the protests called, and in response, the governmentused the policeto intimidate, abduct and kill those protesting. While the bill was nominally suspended, its provisions snuck into legislation over time as pieces of subsidiary legislation rather than a single bill. Changes to the income tax, value-added tax, excise duty and tax procedures have led to increased prices for a range of everyday goods, adding to the overall cost of living.\n\nFor Kenya’s underemployed youth these increases are devastating. It’s worth noting that these young people are relatively highly educated because of two decades of heavily subsidized education, but unable to find jobs because of the country’s unemployment crisis. Nor can they start small businesses because of bureaucratic complexity and high taxes. As a result, these tax increases directly affect thendogo-ndogoeconomy in which they are trapped: piecemeal purchases of small quantities of consumer goods, like 10 cents worth of phone credits for internet access or 5 cents worth of cooking oil. Getting by on predatory loans, gambling and family support, these young people were the foundation of Ruto’s presidential campaign in 2022 and feel especially betrayed by the violence his administration metes out on them.\n\nIn 2025, when the government once again refused to acknowledge public comments and criticisms of yet another round of proposed tax increases in the shadow of corruption and profligate state spending on salaries and bonuses for the legislature and executive. As criticisms rolled in, the registrar of parliament declared that it would treat all comments on the bill submitted by email—the most convenient mechanism for working people to participate in the exercises—as spam, despite Kenyan law allowing email submissions. Rose Njeri, a software engineer,was arrestedfor creating a template to help people submit comments on the bill electronically. Just a few weeks later, Ojwang’ was murdered.\n\nIn the face of the outrage sparked by Ojwang’s death, the government attempted to prohibit protests altogether and then intimidated and brutalized the protesters who did show up. Subsequently, several senior politicians, including Ruto, characterized the protests as a putative coup orchestrated by unnamed shadowy figures, while threatening further police brutality. A shoot-to-kill order was invoked by a member of Ruto’s Cabinet, which Ruto himself later modified into a call for police “shoot their legs and take them to court” in off-the-cuff remarks on July 9. And in a classic case of doublespeak, on the day of theSaba Sabaprotests the police shut down all major roads into Nairobi, Nakuru and other major towns to physically prevent people from gathering, even as they issued statements encouraging people to protest peacefully.\n\nAmid all these attempts by the government to silence critics and protesters, it is important to note that public participation is a pillar of Kenya’s 2010 constitution. This principle has been litigated and debated extensively in the years since then. And the country’s independent judiciary, which famously overturned the results of the 2017 presidential election and ordered a rerun due to irregularities, has concluded that in order for the public’s participation to be considered complete, it must be meaningful.\n\nBut while elections are often portrayed as the litmus test of a functioning democracy in fact they are only one part of the democratic project. Rather, the true substance of democracy is the ongoing conversation between the people and their elected officials in between elections, in which the people express their desires, and elected officials, as custodians of the state for the benefit of the people, adjust their conduct in order to bring about those desires.\n\nThe measure of a healthy democracy is therefore to be found in both the opportunities it affords people to express their desires freely and in the willingness of those who govern to listen and respond. Democracy lies not in the presence of processes like free elections and protests, or institutions like parliament and the press, but in the use of these processes and institutions to host and enable the conversation between the people and their government.\n\nFor the Ruto administration to not only ignore Kenyans’ constitutionally mandated right to public participation in between elections but to actively undermine the mechanisms of participation available to them by threatening and deploying force against protesters is a betrayal of the people and the constitution, as well as the spirit and purpose of democracy. Moreover, they are the actions of an insecure administration for which the very act of expressing dissent is taken as a threat to its legitimacy, rather than an opportunity to strengthen it.\n\nThis is why the protests against successive finance bills have now evolved into calls for Ruto to resign—not just because he is failing as a president but because he is intolerant of dissent and has undermined the mechanisms created to facilitate the ongoing conversation between those who govern and those who are governed.\n\nListening and responding appropriately to dissent in all its forms is a hallmark of democracy and political leadership. Yet the Ruto administration is stumbling from crisis to crisis because it refuses to listen to what Kenyans are saying. Ruto has surrounded himself with a band of loyalists who make incredulous public statements, peppered with casual cruelty, particularly against protesters. The administration tolerates neither advice nor criticism, and instead resorts to doublespeak to create a parallel universe in which shadowy “others” are conspiring against it.\n\nThe vast majority of Kenyans are young, relatively well-educated after a generation of subsidized public education and highly connected, both online and off. When Ruto was campaigning for president in 2022, he crisscrossed the country promising these young people that, unlike previous administrations, he would listen to them and prioritize their needs. Now that he is in office, they are holding him to that very simple promise.\n\nEarly on June 30, Mwangi’s family confirmed that after 12 days in the ICU, he had become another victim of Ruto’s unwillingness to listen. If the Ruto administration is failing at every turn, it is because Ruto struggles with the very concept of democracy, adamantly refusing to listen let alone respond to any kind of dissent. Yet Kenyans have a clear vision of what kind of society they want to live in, and it is not one in which an impervious ruler barricades himself in a tower dictating to the people below by force and fiat. They want to be heard.\n\nNanjala Nyabola is a writer and a political analyst.

    "News_text":"After a sluggish start to 2025, Nvidia (NVDA) stock has come roaring back, reflecting improving market sentiment.\n\nJust a few months ago, the narrative surrounding Nvidia was far more cautious. Earlier in the year, the stock faced mounting pressure as concerns grew over potential demand headwinds for its high-performance GPUs. Notably, the launch of DeepSeek’s cost-effective R1 large language model (LLM) in January raised concerns that Nvidia’s premium-priced chips might lose their appeal. Adding fuel to the fire, new U.S. government restrictions on GPU shipments to China wiped out billions in potential revenue.\n\nThis Underdog AI Stock Just Got a New Street-High Price Target\n\n‘The Most Patriotic Thing You Can Do Is Not Pay the IRS’ Says Grant Cardone as OBBBA Signed into Law — Here’s How Much You’ll Save\n\nTexas Just Passed Quantum Computing Legislation. How Should You Play IONQ Stock Here?\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nOverall, Nvidia’s early 2025 narrative was one of headwinds and caution.\n\nBut the tide has turned. In just three months, Nvidia stock has surged 51%, making it the first publicly traded company to briefly surpass a staggering $4 trillion market cap. As macroeconomic fears have eased, so has the selling pressure on tech, including Nvidia. Further, the company’s dominance across the AI ecosystem, including hardware, software, and networking, puts it in a solid position to capitalize on exploding AI infrastructure demand.\n\nNvidia’s recent financial performance demonstrates the robustness of its fundamentals. In its latest quarter, the company reported $44 billion in revenue, representing a 69% year-over-year increase. The Data Center segment led the charge with $39 billion in sales, up 73%, driven by the accelerating demand. Further, the shift from AI training to inference and the rapid buildout of AI factories around the globe augurs well for growth.\n\nThe company’s new Blackwell platform is now the key growth catalyst. In Q1, Blackwell chips contributed nearly 70% of Data Center compute revenue, marking the fastest ramp in Nvidia’s history. With its innovative GB200 NVL systems, Nvidia is delivering AI compute at an unprecedented scale and efficiency, achieving the lowest cost per inference token in the industry.\n\nNvidia’s resilience shows in other areas as well. Networking has emerged as a powerful second growth engine, generating $5 billion in quarterly revenue, a 64% quarter-over-quarter increase. Technologies like NVLink and Spectrum-X are now essential for AI infrastructure, enabling the high-bandwidth, low-latency performance required for next-generation agentic AI, which aims to surpass generative models by facilitating autonomous reasoning and decision-making.\n\nOutside the Data Center segment, Nvidia continues to gain traction across Gaming, Automotive, and Robotics. Gaming revenue hit a record $3.8 billion, up 48% sequentially. Automotive revenue rose 72% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for self-driving and innovative cockpit platforms. Nvidia’s tech is expected to power the next-generation gaming and AI-powered PCs, expanding its total addressable market in meaningful ways.\n\nNvidia’s momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The tech giant recently shared an upbeat forecast for its second quarter, projecting $45 billion in revenue, reflecting a solid 50% increase compared to the same period last year. This guidance shows the continued strength of its Data Center segment, which remains a key growth driver even amid geopolitical uncertainty. A big part of that resilience comes from the company’s latest innovation, the Blackwell platform, which is expected to help Nvidia maintain global demand despite regional headwinds.\n\nWall Street is optimistic about NVDA’s prospects. Analysts maintain a “Strong Buy” consensus rating on Nvidia.  Moreover, the Street high price target of $250 suggests significant upside potential for NVDA stock over the next 12 months.\n\nWhile Nvidia’s valuation might raise eyebrows at first glance, especially with its forward price-earnings ratio hovering around 40x, the premium appears justified. The company is expected to deliver robust earnings growth of 36.5% in fiscal 2026, followed by an additional 32.3% in fiscal 2027. When you factor in that level of sustained profitability, Nvidia starts to look far more reasonably priced.\n\nFor long-term investors, the answer leans heavily toward “Hold” or even “Buy.” Nvidia continues to deliver impressive growth and has dominant positioning in the AI ecosystem. While geopolitical risks remain, continued demand for its products and innovation make NVDA a compelling investment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

    "News_title":"Why the US is under water",
    "News_text":"Texas. North Carolina. Illinois. New Mexico. New York City. Flash flooding has surged into the spotlight this summer withrecord-breaking flood eventsoccurring nearly back-to-backacross the country.\n\nSlow-moving thunderstorms in Texas unleashed more than an entire summer’s worth of rain on July 4, sending water surging over river banks and killing more than 130 people.\n\nThe same weekend,Tropical Storm Chantalpoured nearly a foot of rain over parts of central North Carolina, causing the Eno River to crest at over 25 feet and shattering a record previously set during Hurricane Fran in 1996. The flooding killedat least six people.\n\nThose floods were followed by a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event to Chicago and storms that caused unprecedented levels of flooding in the mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, thatswept away homesand left three people dead.\n\nAll were extreme and came in quick succession—here’s why they happened now and why floods are becoming more intense.\n\nFlash floodsare most common in the summer months, when intense daytime heat helps fuel thunderstorms. Warmer air can also hold more moisture, giving storms more potential to produce higher rainfall rates than when temperatures are cooler.\n\nIn Texas, storms were fueled by record levels of atmospheric moisture lingering from the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. In North Carolina, Chantal’s tropical moisture played a similar role, helping to drive the intense rainfall that led to deadly flash flooding.\n\nSummer storms also tend to move more slowly. That’s partly because upper-level winds in the atmosphere weaken during summer when there’s less of a temperature difference between the equator and the Earth’s poles and the jet stream shifts farther north.\n\nWhen storms slow down or stall, rain can pile up over the same area for hours and fall faster than the ground can absorb it or infrastructure can drain it, setting the stage for a flash flood.\n\nThat’s what happened in Texas’ Hill Country, where a nearly stationary thunderstorm dumped over 7 inches of rain, and in Chicago, where a stalled storm system dropped as much as 5 inches of rain in just 90 minutes, quickly inundating low-lying streets and some homes.\n\nIn urban areas, pavement and asphalt can cause even more problems, keeping water from soaking into the ground and sending it instead toward storm drains that can quickly overflow or become clogged with debris.\n\nunknown content item\n\n-\n\nA history of wildfires also increases an area’s risk of flash flooding, as Ruidoso has seen since last summer’s devastating South Fork and Salt Fires. When vegetation burns away, landscapes lose their natural ability to absorb and slow down rainwater. On top of that, the extreme heat of a fire can alter the soil itself, creating a water-repellent layer just below the surface.\n\nRainfall on this “burn scarred” land tends to run off rapidly — especially in steep terrain — increasing flash flooding risks even if a storm’s rainfall isn’t extreme. Ruidoso and nearby areas have been under at least 12 separate flash flood emergencies since the 2024 wildfires.\n\nDroughts have a similar effect: When soil dries out over long periods, it can become compacted or even crusted over, reducing its ability to absorb water. Severe to extreme preexisting drought conditions helped amplify flooding in both Texas and New Mexico over the past week.\n\nClimate change from fossil fuel pollution is amplifying the conditions that make flash floodsmore likely and more severe.\n\nFor every degree Celsius (about 2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the atmosphere can hold roughly 7% more water vapor — giving storms more fuel for intense rainfall. And as the overall global temperature increases, moisture-rich air that was once confined to the warm tropics can reach farther from the equator, bringing intense, tropical rainfall to more parts of the world.\n\nAt the same time, wildfires and droughts are becoming more frequent and severe as the world warms, leading to more burn scars and flood vulnerability in fire-prone regions.\n\nHourly rainfall rates have grown heavier in nearly 90% of large US cities since 1970, according to a recent study from the nonprofit research group Climate Central.\n\nIn Chicago, for example, the average intensity has gone up 8%, and Tuesday’s staggering rainfall rates surpassed records set in the 1970s for the city’s most extreme short-duration rainfall.\n\nMany of the nation’s roads, sewers and drainage systems were not designed to handle the kind of rainfall events that are now becoming more common.\n\nFlash flooding has always been a summertime threat, but the risks are evolving. As the atmosphere warms and rainfall patterns continue to shift, more communities could face extreme rainfall events in the years ahead.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Europe is lurching towards tyranny",
    "News_text":"America, we are repeatedly warned, teeters on the edge of tyranny under Donald Trump. Commentators point to the 47th president’s populist rhetoric, plans to purge the civil service, reliance on executive orders, and supposed defiance of judicial authority as existential threats to the American Republic.\n\nScholars like Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, authors ofHow Democracies DieandTyranny of the Minority, argue that US democracy is sliding into authoritarianism. Academic David Driesen recently toldThe Guardianthat Trump is attempting to turn the US into a dictatorship.\n\nThe Left would like us to believe thatTrump’s attacks on “fake news”, and his particular disdain for the progressive media, signal the unravelling of free speech. The truth is that the American system is functioning well and as the Founders intended.\n\nFederal judges have challenged Trump at every turn, issuing countless rulings to block executive actions on immigration, federal funding, and workforce reductions. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed, subjecting his policies to unprecedented scrutiny. Only recently has the Supreme Court, after careful deliberation, limited the use of universal injunctions. Far from presiding over a dictatorship, it’s unlikely that any other US president has faced such a relentless judicial onslaught.\n\nYes, Trump is using the executive powers of the presidency to push through change, but the separation of powers is also proving remarkably effective. Trump may have secured his “Big, Beautiful Bill” through Congress, delivering extended tax cuts, increased defence spending, and immigration reforms. But these victories came at a cost: compromises on Social Security and healthcare funding. This is not tyranny – it’s the messy process of American democracy at work.\n\nIt is particularly galling to hear hysterical warnings about Trump’s threat to democracy from Europeans. Many of them like to believe that their societies are uniquely civilised, champions of universal values in a world lurching towards authoritarianism. Have they not noticed what is happening within their own borders?\n\nAlmost 40 years ago, when the Berlin Wall came down, it was a victory for the free world. America and western Europe – the West – had prevailed against the Soviet system. What is “the West” today?\n\nIt increasingly looks as if the freedoms that Europeans enjoyed since the end of the Second World War were really an aberration, a consequence of the victory of Anglo-American arms in 1945. Europe has begun to revert to a much more authoritarian tradition.\n\nOver the past decade, restrictive laws have tightened their grip on free expression. Germany’s NetzDG has turned social media companies into an internet police force, adding to an existing culture of intolerance towards free speech. One journalist recently received a seven-month suspended sentence for a satirical meme. In France, platforms must remove “hate speech” within 24 hours or face severe fines.\n\nThe European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) leans on online platforms to remove “disinformation” – a term so vague it risks abuse. Claims about Covid-19’s origins, once dismissed as misinformation,are now widely accepted.Yet the DSA empowers regulators to police speech with little real accountability.\n\nHaving started to proscribe dissident opinions online, Europe may soon begin to take action against dissenting political parties. In Germany, there have been calls to ban the opposition party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), making perverse use of a law designed to defend democracy.\n\nBut it is in Britain – which produced the original Bill of Rights – where the clampdown of free speech has perhaps been most alarming. The British police arrested an estimated 12,183 people in 2023 under laws that, among other things, target “grossly offensive” messages. That is about 33 arrests each day in the land of Magna Carta.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous case of someone being locked up for what they said online isLucy Connolly, an ordinary mother, sentenced to more than two years in prison for one horrible social media post. Nobody can credibly claim thatshe poses any threat to the public.\n\nConnolly presumably pleaded guilty on the understanding that she would be treated more leniently.Leniency is the last thing she received.Instead, the authorities seem to have made an example of her, to quell rising anti-immigration sentiment amid fears of public unrest. This is not justice – it’s punishment for dissent. A society that tolerates such verdicts cannot call itself free.\n\nProgressives like to decry Donald Trump’s supposed threat to judicial independence, yet US federal judges have repeatedly checked his decisions. In Britain, however, the judiciary increasingly appears to be an arm of the state, not a restraint upon it.\n\nFor years, defenders of judicial oversight in Britain argued that courts reviewing executive actions would protect individual rights. Incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into British law was hailed as a bulwark for liberty. Yet these safeguards have failed to prevent citizens like Lucy Connolly from being imprisoned for an inflammatory online post. Far from defending freedom, Britain’s courts seem complicit in eroding it.\n\nIf progressives really want to stop a free society that is descending into tyranny, forget about Donald Trump. The Supreme Court, Congress and the Constitution have him covered. No, the real story of emerging tyranny is happening on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nDouglas Carswell is the President & CEO of the Mississippi Centre for Public Policy\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Maddow Blog | 5 major problems with Trump’s radical tariff gambit toward Brazil",
    "News_text":"A few months ago, Marine Le Pen, a prominent far-right politician in France, wascaught up in an embezzlement schemeinvolving E.U. funds, and a French judicial panel examined the evidence and agreed to ban Le Pen from ever seeking elected office again. Donald Trumpthrew an online tantrumand condemned the case against her as a “witch hunt,” but the French ignored him and the American president quietly moved on.\n\nLast month, the Republicandid it again, condemning corruption allegations against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as another “witch hunt,” but Trump did little more than whine.\n\nWhen it comes to former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, however, the incumbent American president is apparently not content to simply pound the table. As my MSNBC colleagueHayes Brown summarized:\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent his Brazilian counterpart a stunning letter Wednesday, informing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that his country would face a new 50% tariff ‘due in part to ... the way Brazil has treated’ former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump political ally. Trump blamed the massive spike in tariffs partly on ‘Brazil’s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans.’\n\nTo briefly recap, voters in Brazil overlooked Bolsonaro’s scandal-plagued record in 2018 and elected him president. Four years later, he narrowly lost his bid for a second term and allegedly plotted what was effectively a coup that would’ve allowed him to remain in power despite his election defeat.\n\nYes, these circumstances might sound familiar.\n\nBolsonaro wants to return to power in South America’s largest country, but he’s currently facing criminal charges for allegedly trying toillegally overturn the resultsof his 2022 loss.\n\nTrump, a close ally of the former Brazilian leader (Bolsonaro has beendescribed by manyas “the Trump of the Tropics”), has done what he always does: The Republican has called the allegations a “witch hunt” and demanded that the charges against the former president be dropped.\n\nBut unlike the French and Israeli examples, Trump is also using tariffs as part of a clumsy scheme to help his Brazilian pal, sendingan unhinged and ridiculously written letterto the country’s actual president, scolding the foreign government, and connecting the case against Bolsonaro to U.S. trade policy.\n\nWhat’s wrong with that? Quite a bit, actually.\n\n1. Trump appears to have forgotten about the legal basis of his trade agenda: According to the White House, the president can unilaterally impose arbitrary tariffs on U.S. trade partners because he’s declared an economic emergency resulting from trade deficits. The trouble in this instance, however, is that the United States has a tradesurpluswith Brazil, adding a legally dubious twist to the Republican’s radical gambit.\n\n2. This is a diplomatic fiasco of historic proportions: There is no precedent for a U.S. administration trying to leverage trade policy to derail a criminal case in a sovereign nation.\n\nOn the Netanyahu matter, a recentAxios reportnoted, “Trump’s comments in a post on his Truth Social account were an unprecedented intervention by a U.S. president in a legal proceeding in another democratic ally.” But that was justrhetoric; with Brazil, he’s imposingactual economic penalties.\n\n3. Trump’s move will hurt consumers in his own country: Hillary Clintonsummarized the problem nicely: “You’re about to pay more for beef not just because Trump wants to protect his corrupt friend, but also because Republicans in Congress have decided to cede their power over trade policy to him.”\n\nIt might sound outlandish to argue that an American president would punish American consumers because he hopes to shield an attempted coup leader from legal accountability, but that’s pretty much what’s happening here.\n\n4. This sure does look like another power grab:Paul Krugman argued, “If we still had a functioning democracy, this Brazil gambit would by itself be grounds for impeachment.” That’s not as outlandish as it might seem: Trump is trying to exercise a power he doesn’t have, in pursuit of unjust ends, despite the Constitution giving Congress authority over international trade policy.\n\n5. Trump is turning U.S. values on their head: There is some precedent for a U.S. administration using tariffs in pursuit of political goals, but those earlier cases, we were trying to lean on foreign governmentsto be more just, not less. Trump has the whole model backwards.\n\nHayes concluded, “[T]he decision to use tariffs as a cudgel to bring Brazil to heel for following its own laws marks a distinct shift in Trump’s willingness to engage in economic warfare for his own personal interests.”\n\nIf someone is prepared to offer a defense for such a move, I’m eager to hear it.\n\nThis article was originally published onMSNBC.com",

    "News_title":"Trump hands Congress a ‘weapon’ he once warned would do ‘grave damage’ to presidency",
    "News_text":"President Donald Trump is trying to force Joe Biden’s former White House aides to divulge confidential discussions to congressional investigators — using the same tactics he once warned would “do grave damage” to the presidency and the republic.\n\nTrump’s White House lawyers, in aseries of recent lettersto Biden aides, said the aides should provide “unrestricted testimony” to a House GOP-led investigation into Biden’s health and whether advisers covered up his frailty while in office.\n\nTo facilitate that testimony, Trump has agreed to “waive” any claims of executive privilege, the legal shield that presidents typically use to maintain the secrecy of candid conversations between a president and close confidants. That protection doesn’t expire when a president leaves office, but the incumbent president has the power to undo it.\n\nTrump’s decision could leave Biden’s aides vulnerable to GOP lawmakers’ demands that they disclose some of the most sensitive details of their conversations with Biden — or risk being held in contempt of Congress and facing criminal charges.\n\nIt’s a dynamicTrump once decriedwhen the roles were reversed: Biden, as president, authorized former White House aides from Trump’s first term to reveal confidential information to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and the monthslong campaign by Trump to subvert the 2020 election results. Now, in his second term, Trump’s White House hinted at that history as a justification for compelling Biden’s aides to testify.\n\n“The President reached this view consistent with the practice established under the Biden administration,” read a letter from White House deputy counsel Gary Lawkowski to former Biden staff secretary Neera Tanden, who testified as part of the investigation last month.\n\nBiden’s post-presidential office declined to comment on the unfolding investigation. The Trump White House declined to comment on the record, but a senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration views Trump’s privilege waiver as less “dangerous” than Biden’s.\n\nThe probe into Biden’s health is being led by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), who dogged Biden for his final two years in office with an investigation into his family’s business dealings. Comer is now demanding testimony from many of Biden’s top White House advisers to determine whether Biden’s health declined while in office and whether anyone concealed any purported decline from the public. The investigation includes a review of whether aides ever acted on Biden’s behalf without his awareness.\n\nComer has said he views the handling of Biden’s health as a “conspiracy” and a “cover-up.” Democrats say the investigation is a politically motivated stunt to settle scores with Trump’s vanquished adversary. And they say the issue has diminished salience now that Biden has retreated from public life.\n\nEven though Trump has waived executive privilege for the Comer probe, there are other avenues for aides to sidestep testimony. Kevin O’Connor, Biden’s physician while in office, cited doctor-patient confidentiality, but alsohis Fifth Amendment rightagainst self-incrimination Wednesday in declining to answer the committee’s questions — a path well-worn by witnesses called to testify by Jan. 6 investigators. It’s unclear whether others called in the Biden probe will adopt O’Connor’s strategy.\n\nDespite the procedural parallels, Biden’s choice to lift secrecy protections occurred under very different circumstances than Trump’s. Biden waived the privilege in order to assist the investigation of an unprecedented assault on the underpinnings of democracy. In contrast, Trump has waived the privilege in hopes of bolstering a roving exploration of Biden’s mental health based on claims, largely from Republicans, that Biden was cognitively incapable of making decisions as president.\n\nBiden aides have dismissed those claims as unfounded. Still, numerous reports about Biden’s diminished capacity, and an entire book on the subject bytwo prominent journalists, have fueled the GOP push.\n\nSome constitutional experts see Trump’s privilege waiver as a troubling sign of a vicious cycle in which presidents of one party will routinely seek to disclose confidential conversations of prior administrations of the opposite party. Indeed, Trump himself warned of that cycle of vengeance when he opposed Biden’s waiver of executive privilege during the Jan. 6 probe.\n\nIf the trend continues, experts say it could lead presidential advisers to shy away from blunt or politically sensitive advice they fear could be disclosed by a political adversary.\n\n“Presidential advisers now avoid as much as possible creating public records of their advice to presidents,” said Mark Rozell, an expert on executive privilege at George Mason University. “Waiving executive privilege will potentially make aides avoid being completely candid in their internal deliberations due to fear of disclosure and future investigations.”\n\nOthers are more circumspect, saying federal employees are already well-schooled in the principle that anything they say behind closed doors could wind up public — in investigations, in court or in leaks from their colleagues.\n\nBut Trump’s willingness to waive the privilege is dangerous for a different reason, according to Rebecca Ingber, a constitutional law scholar at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo Law School. His U-turn on the issue — despite the concerns he previously expressed about the importance of the privilege — is further evidence of his willingness to “simply destroy the norms that typically used to govern these inter-branch disputes,” Ingber said.\n\nPeter Shane, a constitutional law expert at New York University, said \"if Trump's thirst for revenge overcomes his protectiveness of the presidency as an institution, I do think that is up to him.\n\n“As for whether Trump has any political price to pay for contradicting himself,” Shane continued, “I can only say, he doesn't seem to have paid any price so far for his inconsistencies.”\n\nExecutive privilege isn’t written in law or the Constitution, but it has roots stretching back to George Washington and was recognized by the Supreme Court during the Watergate scandal as an important — but limited — protection for the presidency. The idea behind the privilege is that secrecy is necessary for the president to receive candid advice to deal with the most sensitive and controversial subjects facing the nation.\n\nHistorically, even when the White House has changed parties, presidents respected the wishes of their predecessors to maintain the secrecy of records and communications — in part because they knew they would become former presidents one day and wished to preserve both their own records and the strength of the presidency itself.\n\nThat calculus changed after Trump orchestrated a nationwide push to overturn the results of the 2020 election, leading a campaign to undermine the certified results and assembling a rally that later morphed into a violent riot on Jan. 6, 2021. The Democrat-led congressional committee established to investigate the attack (after Republicans killed a proposed bipartisan commission) quickly pursued Trump’s records and interviews with his closest aides.\n\nThe unprecedented circumstances that caused the Jan. 6 attack are why Biden’s directive in late 2021 to waive executive privilege was upheld by the courts. Bidenrepeatedly waivedthe privilege over documents and testimony of Trump’s close advisers, saying the national urgency of understanding the root causes of the attack outweighed the need for executive branch secrecy.\n\nTrump argued at the time that permitting congressional investigators to pierce the secrecy of his communications — even over a subject as weighty as Jan. 6 — would lead to a cycle of retribution by future presidents. He tried to get the courts to step in and keep his White House records concealed from investigators.\n\n“It is naïve to assume that the fallout will be limited to President Trump or the events of January 6, 2021,” Trump’s attorneysarguedat the Supreme Court. “In these hyperpartisan times, Congress will increasingly and inevitably use this new weapon to perpetually harass its political rival.”\n\nHe warned that “if the privilege that covered one administration were to evaporate immediately upon the transition to the next, the privilege would be rendered all but worthless.” It would, his lawyers said, “turn executive privilege into a political weapon to be used against political enemies.”\n\nBut the courts concluded that the Jan. 6 attack was so momentous, and Congress’ need for Trump’s records so great, that executive privilege would have yielded even if Trump were the sitting president at the time.\n\nStill, the Jan. 6 committee did not get all the testimony it wanted from Trump’s advisers. Stephen Millerrefused to discuss“any conversations that he had with President Trump,” saying Trump had not waived executive privilege to permit him to testify. David Warrington, who at the time was an attorney representing Trump’s former White House personnel director, emphasized that Biden’s waiver of privilege was “pretty specific” and “not a broad waiver.” Miller is now Trump’s deputy chief of staff, and Warrington is Trump’s White House counsel.\n\nEven witnesses willing to cooperate with the committee — like Mike Pence’s aides Marc Short and Greg Jacob, as well as Trump’s former White House counsel Pat Cipollone — refused to discuss direct conversations with Trump they said could potentially be covered by claims of executive privilege.\n\n“We have an instruction from President Trump not to respond to questions that may implicate the privilege,” Short’s attorney Emmet Floodtold the Jan. 6 panel.\n\nTrump’s effort, as a former president, to assert privilege over his White House records and testimony by former aides set up an unprecedented clash — no sitting president had ever diverged from the privilege claims of his predecessors. It raised unresolved questions about the degree to which former presidents retain any ability to assert privilege at all. Although the Nixon-era Supreme Court said they do, the justices also emphasized that only the incumbent president is charged with the stewardship of the executive branch and would virtually always prevail in a dispute with his predecessor.\n\nTrump’s effort to stymie the Jan. 6 panel’s probe stands in contrast to Biden, who allies say has made no effort, so far, to instruct witnesses on how to approach the investigation into his cognitive health.\n\nThe Oversight Committee has not specifically articulated the scope of its investigation, but Comer said in a subpoena letter to O’Connor, Biden’s White House physician, that the panel isexploring legislationrelated to “oversight of presidents’ fitness to serve.” Republicans are also looking into making potential changes to the 25th Amendment, which gives Congress a role in determining whether a president is no longer fit to hold office — something House Democrats proposed during their probe of Trump’s actions preceding the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nCommittee Republicans have only just begun their inquiry in earnest. Comer has demanded participation from a wide range of Biden advisers — including two chiefs of staff, Ron Klain and Jeff Zients.\n\nSo far, just one witness has provided testimony: Tanden, the former staff secretary and domestic policy adviser, who fielded questions from the committee behind closed doors for hours.\n\nTanden has publicly indicated she answered all the committee’s questions, and a person familiar with the interview said the issue of executive privilege never came up, beyond a brief mention of Trump’s waiver at the outset.\n\nStill, there are signs the issue may rise again.\n\nAnthony Bernal, a former White House aide and adviser to first lady Jill Biden, withdrew from a scheduled interview after the Trump White House waived his executive privilege, leading to a subpoena from Comer that remains active.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump’s White House issued a letter to O’Connor saying that the “unique and extraordinary nature” of the investigation into Biden’s health was reason to waive executive privilege. The letter further noted that the White House had decided that, after “balancing the Legislative and Executive Branch interests,” Congress should be able to hear O’Connor’s testimony “irrespective of potential executive privilege.”\n\nBiden has so far not instructed aides to resist the probe on executive privilege grounds. In fact, he’s said little at all on the subject, instead leaving it to each witness to determine their own strategy. The former presidenthas maintainedhe made the decisions during his presidency.\n\nA person familiar with the Biden team’s thinking, granted anonymity to reveal confidential discussions, said there’s a key distinction between Biden’s privilege waiver for the Jan. 6 probe and Trump’s privilege waiver now. Despite Trump’s hostility toward the Jan. 6 investigation, the Biden White House engaged regularly with Trump and his team to discuss the contours of the waivers, sometimes narrowing the categories of information they made available to the committee, the person said.\n\nTrump’s White House, on the other hand, is not engaging with the former president, the person said. Nor is the House Oversight Committee.\n\nAsked about the role of executive privilege in the investigation, a committee spokesperson simply pointed to Trump’s waiver and said the issue isn’t being factored into its handling of topics for upcoming witnesses.",

    "News_text":"ST. PETERSBURG — Last year’s back-to-back hurricanes, record rainfalls and unprecedentedfloodingshowed a need for accelerating water and stormwater system upgrades as sea levels rise and storms intensify.\n\nCity officials are responding with a plan to fast-track resiliency projects that had been scheduled to begin in a decade or later.\n\nHow to fund that plan — $614 million to do some of the needed projects within the next five years — remains an open question. The city is already doing some upgrades funded through utility bill increases. But council members are considering bringing voters a referendum to pay for upgrades with a new property tax in lieu of hiking utility rates again for the plan.\n\nCity Council members will continue the discussion in future committee meetings. But if ultimately approved by around May, voters would see a referendum on their November 2026 ballot to decide whether they want a new cost on property tax bills to accelerate planned resiliency projects.\n\nAmong the identified projects are improvements tostormwaterdrainage and wastewater collection systems, stormwater flood protection and pump stations and wastewater treatment facilities.\n\n“I understand not wanting to put more debt onto future generations,” council member Brandi Gabbard said. ”Our city is less desirable, less sustainable and less resilient for future generations if we don’t act now.”\n\nIf approved with a majority vote, the referendum would authorize taking out general obligation bonds to be paid back over 30 years.

    "News_text":"The Russell Smith Courthouse, the Missoula Division of the U.S. District Court of Montana. (Photo by Blair Miller)\n\nA Helenaman detainedby U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents looking for different Latino men had his rights violated and should be released immediately, his lawyers argued Thursday in U.S. District Court in Missoula.\n\nAdditionally, the court should prevent the U.S. government from immediately re-arresting Christopher Martinez based on the same evidence — because it was obtained illegally, said lawyer Molly Danahy of the Upper Seven law firm.\n\nBut Judge Dana Christensen said he wanted to know whether the federal district court had authority in the first place, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Weldon said the court did not.\n\nRather, Weldon said the case against Martinez should be heard in immigration court, also the proper venue for raising questions about his rights.\n\nThursday, the lawyers made their arguments to Christensen before a full gallery in a case that has sparked alarm and outrage in Helena and beyond.\n\nMartinez is a Mexican citizen and national who lives in Helena with his wife and children, according to court records. His wife and their children are American citizens.\n\nAfter a U.S. Marshals Service officer released his handcuffs in court, Martinez reached out to his family in the gallery and touched the face of the littlest child.\n\nLast week, law enforcement officers arrested Martinez during a hunt for two different people, Venezuelan nationals, according to court records.\n\nMartinez’s lawyers allege he was detained illegally, based on appearing to share the same racial ethnicity as the suspects.\n\nHis attorneys said Martinez was engaged in legal activity when he was arrested. They said he was buying parts to fix a hot tub he was repairing.\n\nBut a nearby area was under surveillance, and in search of the other suspects, Helena Police Department officers who were part of the task force observed Martinez, a court document said. It said an ICE officer then requested police stop Martinez.\n\nSix minutes later, police determined his truck had expired plates, court records said. They said a masked ICE officer and other officers interrogated Martinez about his immigration status.\n\nThe officers could easily have verified Martinez’s identity and confirmed he was not one of their suspects based on a traffic stop the previous day, attorneys said. Instead, they purposefully delayed processing the citation, and ICE officers took him to an unmarked vehicle.\n\nIn court, the U.S. Attorney’s office confirmed removal proceedings had started against Martinez.\n\nHowever, in response to a question from Christensen, Weldon confirmed he understood the judge did not want Martinez deported before he had a chance to issue an order.\n\nThe judge ruled Martinez would remain in custody in the meantime.\n\nMartinez’s lawyers are asking the court to find it has jurisdiction in the case, declare his detention violates the Fourth Amendment’s protections against illegal search and seizures, and to release him immediately.\n\nDanahy argued law enforcement officers had no reason to arrest Martinez before they stumbled across his expired registration after first racially profiling him.\n\nAnd she said the law does not allow officers to “transform” an issue into an immigration case without prior suspicion.\n\nHowever, the judge read from court records that said Martinez illegally entered the U.S. on multiple occasions and was expelled. The records the judge read said he applied for entry in 2014 and 2018 but was denied and was under a 10-year ban as a result.\n\nChristensen also wanted to know what would prevent the U.S. government from indicting Martinez for illegal re-entry even if he was released from custody.\n\nDanahy, though, said the government gathered evidence about him unlawfully, and the court should stop the government from immediately rearresting Martinez.\n\nWeldon, on behalf of the government, argued Martinez is being held on a lawful arrest warrant, and the parties were essentially “in the wrong courthouse.”\n\nHe said Martinez could raise questions about whether his arrest was legal in the immigration court instead.\n\n“Mr. Martinez will have his day in court, but that day is not in this court,” Weldon said.\n\nChristensen said he would issue an order as quickly as possible.\n\nIn a press conference after the hearing, Upper Seven founder Rylee Sommers-Flanagan said Martinez did not have a criminal record or warrant for arrest when he encountered ICE agents.\n\n“They were not looking for Christopher,” Sommers-Flanagan said.\n\nHowever, he has been detained for the past nine days, his lawyers said.\n\nSommers-Flanagan said the situation is tied to an “aggressive attack” on immigration by the Trump administration, and it presents “a somewhat unprecedented moment for courts.”\n\n“They need to have an opportunity to consider these questions really thoroughly,” she said.\n\nAfter the hearing, Martinez’s wife, Maria Pacheco, said her husband was deprived of his rights.\n\nShe and his lawyers also said he was prevented from seeing an attorney while initially detained in Lewis and Clark County.\n\n“I just think it’s unfair,” Pacheco said. “He should have the time to be with his kids and his wife.”\n\nThe hearing drew members of the League of Women Voters of Missoula and members of the public. In a statement, local league President Mary LaPorte said the organization was concerned about the lack of due process afforded to Martinez.\n\n“When due process is denied to some people, it puts all of our rights at risk,” LaPorte said.\n\nCommunity member Nancy Seldin of Missoula said she showed up to court because she believes the justice system should be fair to all.\n\n“I think it’s important for citizens to show up in support of people who might be subject to extrajudicial proceedings,” Seldin said.",

    "News_title":"Investigating claims Trump admin's ICE funding surpasses Russia's military budget",
    "News_text":"In the summer of 2025, a rumor spread online that lawmakers provided U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a larger budget than Russia gives its military. Although the numbers cited in these claims differed, most claimed ICE received roughly $170 or $175 billion.\n\nHowever, total funding actually allocated to ICE was roughly $75 billion through September 2029 under U.S. President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) alongside a proposed — but not yet approved — base budget for the agency of $11.29 billion for fiscal year 2026. The $170 or $175 billion number appeared to come from estimates foroverallimmigration enforcement spending under the OBBB, not just funding specifically allocated to ICE.\n\nThese posts also alleged Russia's military budget was anywhere from $126 billion to $149 billion. Reputable think tanks estimated Russia's military funding at about $149 billion U.S. dollars in 2024 and $160 billion in planned spending for 2025.\n\nThus, potential ICE spending under the Trump administration for fiscal year 2026 did not surpass an estimate for Russia's planned military spending in 2025. However, it's possible the United States' overall immigration enforcement spending from Oct. 1, 2025, to Sept. 30, 2026, could exceed Russia's planned military budget in 2025. A direct comparison was not possible because the two countries use different budgeting timelines.\n\nIn the summer of 2025, a claim spread online that American lawmakers granted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) a bigger budget than Russia provided its military.\n\nThe rumor spread on platforms likeXandFacebook; while many claims included dollar amounts for both Russia's military and ICE, those numbers differed. For example, some posts alleged ICE received$175 billionin funding; others claimed the agency received$170 billionto spend. In comparison, claims listed Russia's military budget as anywhere from$126 billionto$149 billion.\n\nThese claims appeared to use legitimate — but outdated — sources to determine Russia's military budget while also conflating ICE's funding withestimatesfor overall immigration enforcement spending under U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and budget megabill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which hesigned into lawon July 4, 2025.\n\nA direct, entirely accurate monetary comparison of the two budgets was not possible, given differences in how the United States and Russia provide budget information — as well as theunstableexchange rate between Russia's currency, the ruble, and the American dollar, at least as of this writing.\n\nHowever, potential ICE spending by Trump's administration for fiscal year 2026, which runs from Oct. 1, 2025 to Sept. 30, 2026, did not surpass reputable estimates for Russia's planned military spending in 2025. Still, it's possible that the United States' overall immigration enforcement spending in fiscal year 2026 could exceed Russia's potential military budget in 2025.\n\nSnopes previouslydeterminedthe actual amount allocated to ICE under the Big Beautiful Bill andprovided contextfor a rumor that funds allocated to ICE exceeded spending for the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nTwo major budget allocations were slated to be available to ICE for fiscal year 2026. The first was the base budget amount, known as the \"appropriations\" process. Although the presidentrequestedthese funds in May, as of this writing, the U.S. Congress had not yet approved his budget proposal. The Big Beautiful Bill, a budget \"reconciliation\" bill, was considered a supplement to the base budget.\n\nThe total proposedbase budgetfor ICE in fiscal year 2026 was $11.29 billion, according to the agency'sbudget requestdocument — an increase from $10.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 (seePage 5). According to the agency, the bulk of that amount, $10.88 billion, would need Congressional approval; the rest would come from fees, such as those imposed on travelers.\n\nIn addition to this base budget, ICE will receive another approximately $75 billion to remain available until Sept. 30, 2029, through theBig Beautiful Bill, as wepreviously reported.\n\nThere were two major provisions in the GOP bill allocating funds to ICE: the first provision, onPage 825, Section 90003, \"Detention Capacity,\" sent $45 billion to ICE specifically for immigration detention centers (emphasis ours):\n\nSEC. 90003. DETENTION CAPACITY.\n\nIn addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated, there isappropriated to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, toremain available until September 30, 2029,$45,000,000,000, for single adult alien detention capacity and family residential center capacity.\n\nThe second provision, starting onPage 904, appropriated $29.85 billion to ICE for the purposes of hiring, training, recruiting and retaining officers, facility upgrades, \"promoting family unity\" by keeping detained immigrants with their children, attorneys and legal staff, funding an office supporting victims of immigration crimes and \"fleet modernization\" — presumably a reference to updating ICE aircraft and vehicles.\n\nSEC. 100052.

In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Homeland Securityfor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated,$29,850,000,000, to remain available through September 30, 2029.\n\nAdd the two provisions together to arrive at $74.85 billion on top of the annual base budget proposed at $11.29 billion for fiscal year 2026. The Big Beautiful Bill also imposed additional fees on people facing various immigration enforcement actions, a portion of which would go to ICE's coffers (see pages 896 and 898 ofthe bill).\n\nAccording to an April 2025publicationby theStockholm International Peace Research Institute, a highlyrespectedthink tank that collects global data on annual military spending, the \"planned total military expenditure in 2025\" for Russia was about 5.5 trillion rubles, equivalent to about $160 billion U.S. dollars — \"although the volatility of the exchange rate makes this estimate highly speculative,\" the institute warned onPage 8.\n\nThe actual amount spent, according to the institute'smilitary spending tracker, was about $149 billion U.S. dollars, assome claimsstated.\n\nAside from the constantly changing exchange rate for the ruble, it is also difficult to provide a direct comparison of Russia's spending with the ICE budget because in Russia budget yearsmatchwith calendar years, whereas in the United States budgets typically follow fiscal years. Fiscal year 2026, for example, runs from Oct. 1, 2025 to Sept. 30, 2026.\n\nFurthermore, ICE'sbudget documentsdid not include how much the agency planned to budget from the Big Beautiful Bill's allocations for fiscal year 2026. As such, it was not possible to determine ICE's exact total annual budget, as the Big Beautiful Bill stipulated a single large infusion of money — the $75 billion — to remain available to the agency for multiple years, through Sept. 30, 2029.\n\nSnopes asked ICE whether the agency can provide estimates for how much it planned to spend from Big Beautiful Bill allocations in fiscal year 2026 and awaits a response.\n\nStill, adding the $74.85 billion (available over four years) to the proposed $11.29 billion (over one budget year) makes a total of $86.14 billion that could be allocated to ICE, far less than the $160 billion estimate for Russia's planned military spending in 2025.\n\nAdvocacygroupsandreputablenewsoutletshave made estimates ranging from$150 billionto $170 billionfortotal overall immigration enforcementspending under the Big Beautiful Bill. Alongside the $75 billion for ICE, the $150 billion-to-$175 billion amount would include, for example, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement provisions, such as $46.55 billion allocated for the border wall and $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol personnel (seePage 824).\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Harris, a Republican from North Carolina, also claimed in a July 3news releasethat the bill allocated $175 billion in \"new funding\" to \"finish securing the border.\" Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina,reportedlytold journalists back in February that the Trump administration initially asked for $175 billion in immigration enforcement funding.\n\nSnopes has not independently verified any of these estimates.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that these $150 billion-to-$175 billion estimates were focused on the Big Beautiful Bill alone. In other words, they do not appear to encompasstotalamounts of spending on immigration enforcement. For instance, aside from the amount in the Big Beautiful Bill, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requested $23 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol's base budget (seePage 4).\n\nU.S. lawmakers allocated $75 billion to ICE under the Big Beautiful Bill through Sept. 30, 2029, and Trump proposed an $11.29 billion base budget on top of that for fiscal year 2026, which Congress had not yet approved as of this writing. In contrast, a reputable think tank estimated Russia's planned military spending for 2025 at approximately $160 billion U.S. dollars, a figure subject to change due to the fluctuating exchange rate between Russian rubles and American dollars. Estimates foroverallimmigration spending, not just ICE's funding, ranged from $150 billion to $170 billion.\n\nWhile direct comparisons are not possible because the two countries present financial information differently, ICE's potential budget for fiscal year 2026 does not exceed Russia's military budget for 2025. However, overall immigration enforcement spending in the United States for fiscal year 2026 could exceed the amount Russia's military might receive in 2025.\n\nInformation from Snopes' archives was included in this story.\n\n\"AILA Denounces Passage of Draconian Immigration Spending Bill: A $150 Billion Blueprint for Mass Deportation and Fear.\"Aila.org, 1 July 2025, www.aila.org\/library\/aila-denounces-passage-of-draconian-immigration-spending-bill-a-150-billion-blueprint-for-mass-deportation-and-fear.

    "News_title":"Families of Those Killed in Black Hawk Collision with Jet Want More 'Openness, Compassion' from Army",
    "News_text":"Family members who lost loved ones when a passenger jet and anArmyBlack Hawkhelicopter collided midair in Washington, D.C., in January said in a letter that Army leadership is failing to take accountability and be transparent with those who are still mourning from the tragedy.\n\nThe letter, posted publicly Wednesday, is addressed to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and calls on the service to communicate directly with the families in the wake of the crash, as well as designate a point person to keep them notified of steps in several ongoing probes related to the circumstances of the collision.\n\n\"We understand that legal and procedural considerations may complicate engagement with families,\" relatives of those who died on American Eagle Flight 5342 wrote. \"However, the unprecedented nature of this tragedy calls for a higher standard of openness, compassion and leadership worthy of public trust.\"\n\nRead Next:Tim Kennedy, Green Beret and Army Hype Man, Under Investigation for Lying About Combat Valor\n\nThe Jan. 29 crash between the passenger plane and the Black Hawk helicopter fromFort Belvoir, Virginia, killed the three-member helicopter crew and the 64 aboard the flight -- marking the worst major commercial airline crash in the U.S. in 16 years. The 168 family members who signed the letter noted they had heard from the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and American Airlines but said in the letter they were alarmed by the silence from the Army.\n\n\"Other agencies have found ways to engage constructively with us while maintaining the integrity of their investigations,\" the families wrote. \"We believe the Army can, and should, do the same.\"\n\nFamily members of those lost on Flight 5342 told Military.com that, beginning roughly a week after the crash and the initial aftermath, there had not been any formal organized communication with the Army.\n\nBut members of Congress have gotten involved, and now a tentative meeting between Army leadership and the families may be in the works, Military.com has learned. That meeting may occur around a scheduled three-day National Transportation Safety Board investigation hearing into the crash scheduled for later this month.\n\nMontrell Russell, an Army spokesperson, confirmed toMilitary.comin an emailed statement on Friday, after publication, that the service planned on meeting with the families, adding that it “deeply shares in their grief.”\n\n\"We extend our deepest condolences to the families affected by this tragic loss and acknowledge their frustrations,” Russell said in the statement. “We share the families' goal of preventing similar tragedies from occurring in the future. We are fully cooperating with the NTSB investigation and intend to meet with the families before the scheduled NTSB hearings.”\n\nThe Army’s statement is a notable turnaround in tone from remarks made by Driscoll just last month.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., asked Driscoll during a June hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee why there hadn't been any direct communication with the families. While the Army secretary said the service was \"doing everything we can\" to learn about the crash, he also pointed to ongoing litigation as a reason for the lack of transparency.\n\n\"There is obviously an investigation and lawsuits ongoing,\" Driscoll said. \"And the best advice we've received from counsel to date is to let those play out.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Driscoll did not return an email request seeking comment on the letter by press time.\n\nAmy Hunter, who lost her cousin Peter Livingston; his wife Donna; and their daughters, Everly and Alydia, in the Jan. 29 crash, told Military.com in an interview Thursday that she hopes the Army engaging in discussions will help ensure that other families won't experience the same pain.\n\n\"We want to do everything that we can so that no service members and their families, and no more civilians and their families, are put in the situation that we were,\" Hunter said. \"We believe that a way to help prevent that is to have open communication and an ongoing relationship to help make sure that our national airspace is as safe as it can be, in particular, as it relates to military and civilian aviation coordination.\"\n\nNTSB briefings following the crash have pointed to several potential issues with the Army's Black Hawk helicopter training flight from Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion. Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Chief Warrant Officer Andrew Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Staff Sgt. Ryan O'Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, were all killed in the crash.\n\nInvestigators said that crew may not have received accurate altitude readings in their cockpit and that an important transmission from air traffic control just before the deadly crash may not have been received,Military.com previously reported.\n\nIn March, the NTSB called for the helicopter path, called Route 4, used by Army Black Hawks for training to be closed. Investigators cited upward of 15,000 close calls in which commercial airplanes and helicopters had a lateral separation distance of less than 1 nautical mile and vertical separation of less than 400 feet at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport between October 2021 and December 2024.\n\nThe FAA announced it had closed Route 4 shortly after those revelations.\n\nLast month, lawmakers wrote to the inspectors general of the Department of Transportation and the Army \"pushing for respective investigations into Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Army policies and procedures that may have contributed\" to the crash,a news release detailed.\n\nFamily members and lawmakers are also probing whether issues and errors involving the helicopter's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, played a role in the crash.\n\nThe letter signed by the families calls on Driscoll to appoint a dedicated family liaison to serve as a point of contact with grieving relatives, schedule a meeting with the group within 30 days, and commit to transparency as well as publicly support the inspector general audits being requested by lawmakers.\n\n\"Given that this is the deadliest incident involving U.S. civilian casualties caused by the military in modern history, the Army has a heightened responsibility to ensure full public transparency and urgent implementation of meaningful safety reforms,\" the letter reads. \"The scale of this tragedy demands complete cooperation and accountability from all parties involved -- including the U.S. Army.\"\n\nEditor’s note: This article has been updated with an Army statement provided toMilitary.comafter publication.\n\nRelated:Route Used by Army Black Hawk During Deadly Collision Was Far Too Risky, Safety Officials Say",

    "News_title":"Trump, Harvard fight escalates after president said deal was close",
    "News_text":"The Trump administration is ramping up its war with Harvard University despite the president having previously hinted a deal was in the works.\n\nThe White House is pulling nearly every lever at its disposal to try to get Harvard to bend the knee to its demands,threatening its accreditationand issuing asubpoena over international studentsin its latest moves this week.\n\n“We’re clearly seeing the emergence of a playbook by the Trump administration. They have been open about the fact that they are going to try to use every possible form of leverage they can find to compel institutions to bend to their will,” said Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations and national engagement at the American Council on Education.\n\n“What we’ve seen so far is across every aspect of the public space, whether that’s in the courts, whether that’s in public opinion … they are losing these arguments, and it’s unfortunate they keep trying to expand the efforts. It’s unfortunate they keep trying to politicize processes that have worked well for a long time,” he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Education Department sent a letter to Harvard’s accreditor, saying Trump administration probes have found the school in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\n\n“By allowing anti-Semitic harassment and discrimination to persist unchecked on its campus, Harvard University has failed in its obligation to students, educators, and American taxpayers. The Department of Education expects the New England Commission of Higher Education to enforce its policies and practices, and to keep the Department fully informed of its efforts to ensure that Harvard is in compliance with federal law and accreditor standards,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.\n\nRemoving accreditation would cut off Harvard’s access to federal student aid. Universities that have lost accreditation typically shut down soon afterward, though none the size or age of Harvard have ever been targeted.\n\nWhile the commission emphasized in a statement that the government cannot force it to take away accreditation and that the processes even for those found to be in violation can last years, higher education experts are getting nervous about the unprecedented nature of these letters from the Trump administration.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration sent a similar letter to Columbia University’s accreditor.\n\n“The letter that was sent informing Harvard there was an investigation — of course, the accreditors need to be aware of that, but the accreditors need to be able to make their own decision as to what to do with that information, and it seems like Secretary McMahon is trying to go beyond that, which, to me, stands as an unprecedented overstep in what the role of the Department of Education has been in the past in terms of accreditation in in higher education,” said Gerardo Blanco, academic director for the Center for International Higher Education at Boston College.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said it was going to subpoena Harvard for information about its foreign students, one of the major fronts in both President Trump’s war with Harvard and his sweeping immigration crackdown.\n\nHarvard has denied allegations from the federal government that it has withheld information about its international students and contends it has complied with all “lawful requests.”\n\n“Harvard certainly has it within its rights to challenge that subpoena, to say that it’s inappropriate, that it’s overbroad, that they’ve responded to it,” said Ray Brescia, a professor at Albany Law School. “If it’s inappropriate, if it violates the students’ rights, if it’s too expansive, then I imagine that Harvard is going to resist it to the full extent of the law.”\n\nHarvard decried both the actions this week, condemning the federal government’s findings that it violated antidiscrimination laws and insisting it has turned over the information regarding its foreign students it was legally obligated to.\n\n“Harvard is far from indifferent on this issue and strongly disagrees with the government’s findings. Harvard continues to comply with the New England Commission of Higher Education’s Standards for Accreditation, maintaining its accreditation uninterrupted since its initial review in 1929,” a university spokesperson said.\n\nAny move that Trump makes against Harvard can be seen as a warning shot to other schools, particularly after the University of Virginia and the University of Pennsylvania both made major concessions to his administration after their funding was endangered.\n\n“I think one of my biggest concerns is that this is happening to Harvard, but this could just as easily switch to other institutions. Of course, we saw it happen at Columbia. We’ve seen things happen at Penn. Different institutions are dealing with it differently,” said Marybeth Gasman, executive director for Rutgers University’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions.\n\n“With regard to Harvard, I think that they can fight this in the courts, and they’ve already had some success,” Gasman added.\n\nBut the latest escalations come after Trump said last month that his administration was close to achieving a deal with Harvard.\n\nThe school and the administration are locked into two court battles — one regarding $3 billion in funding paused to the university and another over a directive that attempted to ban Harvard from enrolling foreign students.\n\nThe funding case has a hearing at the end of July, while a judge has ruled against the directive banning foreign students; Trump has appealed that ruling.\n\n“We have been working closely with Harvard, and it is very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so,” Trumpwrote June 20.\n\n“They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right. If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be ‘mindbogglingly’ HISTORIC, and very good for our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” he added.\n\nSince that announcement, the administration has been mum on any details, and Harvard has not given any indication of a deal will be forthcoming.\n\nTrump has also made similar statements about trade agreements with other nations that have so far produced no apparent results.\n\n“It does make you wonder why they feel the need to keep talking about having a deal when those deals don’t manifest. And I will say I don’t know where negotiations stand, but Harvard has been very clear in the past about what the red lines [are] for them,” Fansmith said, emphasizing the institution says it won’t give up control of its faculty.\n\n“I don’t know whether there is some effort in the administration where they are either trying to preemptively take credit for what’s coming, or whether they are not successful in trying to simply shift the public narrative around what’s happening here, to make it seem like these abusive efforts are winning,” he added. “Hard to say, but certainly, this is now the third or fourth time we’ve heard from the administration that they’re on the cusp of the deal, and yet no deal has come to anything.

    "News_text":"A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo.Sign upfor the email version.\n\nNewly released emails and texts provide anextraordinary glimpseof internal government communications during some of the most consequential legal cases of the early months of the Trump II presidency.\n\nThe internal communications come from Erez Reuveni, a career Justice Department lawyer who was fired by the Trump administration for being too candid with the court in the Abrego Garcia case. The emails and texts bolster previous allegations Reuveni had made in seeking whistleblower protections.\n\nFor our purposes, the most important element of the Reuveni revelations is the planned defiance of federal courts, including misleading, if not downright false, representations to judges, indefensible legal positions, and violations of court orders. The primary villain in the account provided by Reuveni continues to be DOJ official Emil Bove, the former personal attorney for President Trump who was riding herd on the most controversial early Trump II cases and who Reuveni has alleged told DOJ personnel that they might have to tell the courts “fuck you.”\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\nIn the Alien Enemies Act case before Judge James Boasberg in DC, Reuvenitexteda colleague about Bove’s alleged comment: “Guess we are going to say ‘fuck you’ to the court. Super,” he wrote. The colleague responded: “Well, Pamela Jo Bondi is. Not you.”\n\nIn the AEA case, it was Bove, according to the internal communications, who said it waslegally permissibleto deplane the Venezuelan detainees in El Salvador despite Judge Boasberg’s order.\n\nIn the Abrego Garcia case, the internal communications show a race by the Trump administration tofind evidenceto support calling him a MS-13 “leader” as a larger public smear campaign of the wrongly deported Salvadoran was getting into full swing.\n\nFor his part, Bove has denied proposing to defy the courts and has said he doesn’t recall saying “fuck you.”\n\nThe timing of the Reuvenirevelationsis strategic, which isn’t to say they’re somehow compromised or not credible. The chief culprit in Reuveni’s account is about to get a lifetime seat on a federal appeals court, so waiting until later to tell his story in full would be too little, too late.\n\nBove’s nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals isexpectedto come to a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee next week. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said this week that he would “probably” vote to confirm Bove in committee, virtually assuring the nomination will make it to the floor, where it’s not clear enough GOP senators will stand up to block Bove’s lifetime appointment.\n\nBeyond the early round of mass firings at the DOJ and FBI, a steady drumbeat of firing, demotions, and resignations continues, theWaPo reports:\n\nThe Trump administration is firing and pushing out employees across the Justice Department and FBI, often with no explanation or warning, creating rampant speculation and fear within the workforce over who might be terminated next, according to multiple people with knowledge of the removals who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution.\n\nDozens of FBI personnel have been subjected to polygraphs to try to sniff out news leaks and disloyalty to FBI Director Kash Patel, theNYT reports:\n\nThe use of the polygraph, and the nature of the questioning, is part of the F.B.I.’s broader crackdown on news leaks, reflecting, to a degree, Mr. Patel’s acute awareness of how he is publicly portrayed. The moves, former bureau officials say, are politically charged and highly inappropriate, underscoring what they describe as an alarming quest for fealty at the F.B.I., where there is little tolerance for dissent. Disparaging Mr. Patel or his deputy, Dan Bongino, former officials say, could cost people their job.\n\nThe Democracy Docket has compiled atimelineof the key steps in the Trump DOJ’s sharp anti-voting shift.\n\nThe Trump DOJ has subpoenaed confidential patient information from more than 20 doctors and hospitals that provide gender-related treatments to minors, theNYT reports.\n\nA federal judge in New Hampshirequickly seizedon the opening left by the Supreme Court in its birthright citizenship case bycertifyinga national class action case that enjoins President Trump’s executive order. Hepausedhisdecisionfor seven days to give the Trump administration time to appeal it.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, the pro-Palestinian Columbia University graduate student targeted by the Trump administration for his political views, has begun the process of filing a lawsuit against the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Khalil isseeking $20 millionfor false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and other claims. Khalil has been released from detention but his immigration case is still pending.\n\nWSJ: “Harvard leaders have discussed creating a program that people briefed on the talks described as a center for conservative scholarship, possibly modeled on Stanford’s Hoover Institution, as the school fights the Trump administration’s accusations that it is too liberal.”\n\nThe Trump administration moved to change decades-old policy anddenyundocumented immigrants access to Head Start and other federal benefits programs.\n\nThe GOP primary for Senate in Texas ain’t for the faint of heart.\n\nState Sen. Angela Paxton (R), the wife of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who is challenging incumbent Sen.

    "News_text":"(Fixes advisory line to note that update adds details of Afghan resettlement program in paragraph 13)\n\nBy Humeyra Pamuk\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department began firing more than 1,350 U.S.-based employees on Friday as the administration of PresidentDonald Trumppresses ahead with an unprecedented overhaul of its diplomatic corps, a move critics say will undermine U.S. ability to defend and promote U.S. interests abroad.\n\nThe layoffs, which affect 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service officers based in the United States, come at a time when Washington is grappling with multiple crises on the world stage: Russia's war in Ukraine, the almost two-year-long Gaza conflict, and the Middle East on edge due to high tension between Israel and Iran.\n\n\"The Department is streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities,\" an internal State Department notice that was sent to the workforce said. \"Headcount reductions have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found,\" it added.\n\nThe total reduction in the workforce will be nearly 3,000, including the voluntary departures, according to the notice and a senior State Department official, out of the 18,000 employees based in the United States.\n\nThe move is the first step of a restructuring that Trump has sought to ensure U.S. foreign policy is aligned with his \"America First\" agenda. Former diplomats and critics say the firing of foreign service officers risks America's ability to counter the growing assertiveness from adversaries such as China and Russia.\n\n\"President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio are once again making America less safe and less secure,\" Democratic senator Tim Kaine from Virginia said in a statement.\n\n\"This is one of the most ridiculous decisions that could possibly be made at a time when China is increasing its diplomatic footprint around the world and establishing an overseas network of military and transportation bases, Russia is continuing its years-long brutal assault of a sovereign country, and the Middle East is careening from crisis to crisis,\" Kaine said.\n\nDozens of State Department employees crowded the lobby of the agency’s headquarters in Washington holding an impromptu \"clap-out\" for their colleagues who have been fired. Dozens of people were crying, as they carried their belongings in boxes and hugged and bid farewell to friends and fellow workers.\n\nOutside, dozens of others were lined up continuing to clap and cheer for them with some holding banners that read, “Thank you America’s diplomats.” Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen attended the demonstration.\n\nSeveral offices were set up inside the building for employees who are being laid off to turn in their badges, laptops, telephones and other property owned by the agency.\n\nThe offices were marked by posters that read \"Transition Day Out Processing\". One counter was labeled an \"Outprocessing service center\" with small bottles of water placed next to a box of tissue. Inside one office, cardboard boxes were visible.\n\nA five-page \"separation checklist\" that was sent to workers who were fired on Friday and seen by Reuters tells the employees that they would lose access to the building and their emails at 5 p.m. EDT on Friday.\n\nMany members of a State Department office overseeing the U.S. resettlement of Afghans who worked for the U.S. government during the 20-year war have also been terminated as part of the overhaul.\n\n'WRONG SIGNAL'\n\nTrump in February ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the foreign service to ensure that the Republican president's foreign policy is \"faithfully\" implemented. He has also repeatedly pledged to \"clean out the deep state\" by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal.\n\nThe shake-up is part of an unprecedented push by Trump to shrink the federal bureaucracy and cut what he says is wasteful spending of taxpayer money. His administration dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Aid, Washington's premier aid arm that distributed billions of dollars of assistance worldwide, and folded it under the State Department.\n\nRubio announced the plans for the State Department shake-up in April, saying the Department in its current form was \"bloated, bureaucratic\" and was not able to perform its mission \"in this new era of great power competition.\"\n\nHe envisioned a structure that he said would give back the power to regional bureaus and embassies and get rid of programs and offices that do not align with America's core interests.\n\nThat vision would see the elimination of the role of top official for civilian security, democracy, and human rights and the closure of some offices that monitored war crimes and conflicts around the world.\n\nThe reorganization had been expected to be largely concluded by July 1 but did not proceed as planned amid ongoing litigation, as the State Department waited for the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on the Trump administration's bid to halt a judicial order blocking mass job cuts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court cleared the way for the Trump administration to pursue the job cuts and the sweeping downsizing of numerous agencies. Since then, The White House Counsel's Office and the Office of Personnel Management have been coordinating with federal agencies to ensure their plans comply with the law.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Alistair Bell)",

But critics argue the move goes against Congress’s approval of the funds and places schools across the country in financial limbo.\n\nCMS states that President Trump signed a Continuing Resolution (CR) into law in March, which maintained federal education funding at last year’s levels.

    "News_title":"‘The Evidence Is Not Credible’: Judge Skewers Defiant Trump DOJ In Abrego Garcia Case",
    "News_text":"GREENBELT, MARYLAND – In a saga that has dragged on for four months that feel like four years, the Trump administration continues to stonewall the judge in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case with dilatory tactics and bad faith responses to her inquiries. Unlike thein-your-face defianceof a few weeks ago, the tactics have become a little more subtle and perhaps less obvious to non-lawyers, but they’re not lost on U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis.\n\nWith Abrego Garcia now facing criminal charges in Tennessee, the question is no longer whether the government will return him from wrongful imprisonment in El Salvador but whether it will deport him again if he is released from criminal custody — which could come as soon as next week — while his trial is pending. That’s the issue Xinis was being asked to grapple with in what was supposed to be a brief evidentiary hearing that improbably stretched from yesterday afternoon into this morning. Xinis hasn’t yet ruled on Abrego Garcia’s requests, including that he and his attorneys be given 72 hours notice before he’s removed to a third country and that in the meantime he be returned to Maryland, where he lived before he was removed to El Salvador in violation of an immigration judge’s order. A ruling from Xinis is imminent.\n\nI want to look beyond the ultimate fate of Abrego Garcia to the larger issues the case raises about the rule of law. His case presents profound and still unanswered questions about whether the Trump administration can and will be held to account for brazenly defying court orders, giving the judge the runaround, advancing shifting and contradictory legal arguments, jerking the opposing side around during discovery, and using DOJ lawyers to shield government officials from court scrutiny. While the administration’s treatment of Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully detained at CECOT in El Salvador for some 10 weeks, has been abhorrent, its conduct in court has been egregious, too.\n\nLet’s start with the DOJ lawyers in the case. After the Trump DOJ early on fired career attorney Erez Reuveni for being too candid with the court, most of the heavy lifting in the case has been done by political appointees, itself unusual and unprecedented at this scale and frequency prior to the second Trump presidency. On top of that, DOJ has sent an ever-changing cast of political appointees into court, not just diminishing the quality of the lawyering but making it difficult for   the judge to hold them to account for their previous representations and assurances.\n\nAcross three days of hearings this week, a merry-go-round of DOJ lawyers popped up again.  Anewly mintedDOJ attorney named Bridget O’Hickey arrived at a hearing in the case on Monday and handled about half of the government’s argument but didn’t enter her appearance in the case until Wednesday. O’Hickey didn’t start working at the Justice Department until May, according to her Linkedin profile; the Abrego Garcia case started in March.\n\nBy Thursday, another new face popped up at the government counsel table. Sarmad M. Khojasteh joined DOJ in April, according to his Linkedin profile, and had had no previous involvement in the Abrego Garcia case, at least not on the record. But he was suddenly lead counsel for the government across two days of hearings, during which he frequently drew the judge’s ire by mangling the history of the case.\n\nJudge Xinis of Maryland has lightly remarked on the cavalcade of DOJ lawyers, with tart but breezy asides from the bench like, “I’m sure you’ve read everything in the case.” The revolving door of DOJ attorneys seems clearly intended to replenish the exhausted supply of the benefit of the doubt and personal capital expended by prior attorneys. It has also made it harder for Xinis to pin the government down.\n\nBut the bulk of the bad faith conduct over the last two days involved the witness that the government put on the stand after Xinis ordered it to present an official with personal knowledge of the Abrego Garcia case who could answer questions about what the government intends to do with him if he is released pending trial in Tennessee.\n\nThe government called Thomas Giles, a career ICE official who is now the interim assistant director for enforcement and removal operations, a relatively high-ranking position. But as Abrego Garcia’s attorneys quickly drew out on cross examination, Giles had had no involvement with the Abrego Garcia case until Tuesday morning, when he received a call notifying him that he would be the designated government witness.\n\nIt only got worse from there. Pressed by Abrego Garcia lawyer Sascha N. Rand to explain what he had done to prepare for his testimony, Giles admitted to reading a one-and-a-half-page executive summary of the case that had been prepared for him, doing a cursory search of his emails, and reviewing new ICE policies on third country removals. Giles confirmed that other than government lawyers, he had talked to no other officials in or outside of ICE involved in the Abrego Garcia case to get himself up to speed.\n\n“I do not have personal knowledge of the case,” Giles conceded at one point, before trying to rally. “But I did acquire that knowledge over the past two days.”\n\nIn sum, it became apparent that Giles had no personal knowledge of the Abrego Garcia case despite Xinis’ order that the government produce such a witness.\n\n“He didn’t call anyone,” Judge Xinis later observed. “He didn’t read anything.”\n\nGiles wasn’t even familiar with the broader policy of third country removals, the process for which the judge was trying to understand so that she could anticipate what might happen to Abrego Garcia as soon as next week. After extended, convoluted testimony from Giles about his understanding of how third country removals work, he conceded, “I have very little experience with third country removals. I haven’t processed anyone in 18 years.”\n\nGiles’ lack of familiarity with the case and general obtuseness dragged what was supposed to have been, according to the judge, a hearing of one hour or so into a four-hour grind of circular, non-responsive answers and multiple interventions by the judge to try to clear up her own confusion about what standard policy at ICE used to be, what it is now, and whether it will be applied to Abrego Garcia.\n\n“I don’t have a whole lot of faith that I understand exactly what is going on,” Xinis would later say.\n\nIt was a less dramatic but effective parallel to the myriad other obstacles the administration erected to stonewall earlier phases of the case. It left Xinis with “grave concerns about what I heard today and what will happen to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” she said at the end of testimony Thursday.\n\nGiles’ non-responsive testimony set the stage for arguments Friday morning on Abrego Garcia’s emergency motion seeking 72-hours notice before he’s removed to a third country and his return to Maryland while his trial is pending. Xinis arrived in a sour mood over what she had heard from Giles and the government’s conduct, at one point calling a government argument “an insult to my intelligence.”\n\nIt went downhill from there for new-to-the-case DOJ lawyer Sarmad M. Khojasteh.\n\n“You’re making the plaintiff’s point,” Xinis interjected during his argument. “The point is the utter refusal of your client to engage in any conversation about what is going to happen on Wednesday despite the extraordinary circumstances of this case.”\n\nIn comments from the bench, Xinis confirmed that she had little faith in Giles’ testimony and that it had undermined rather than bolstered the government’s position. “The evidence is not credible,” Xinis said. “It’s insufficient and incredible.”\n\nXinis was particularly incensed by the government’s repeated assertions — made dozens of times — that Abrego Garcia’s fate next week would be left to a yet-to-be-determined low-level case officer and that officer wouldn’t even begin to consider what to do with Abrego Garcia until he is moved from criminal custody into ICE custody.\n\n“It defies reality that this is going to be left to a desk officer,” Xinis told Khojasteh. “And the more you press that, the more concerned I am.”\n\nUnderlying Xinis’ concern is that the Abrego Garcia case has clearly been handled at the highest levels of the Trump administration, including at the Cabinet level and into the White House. Her efforts to figure out who has been making decisions and to obtain testimony from administration officials with direct knowledge of those decisions have mostly failed over the past four months. Instead, she’s been given witnesses who can’t speak from personal knowledge. DOJ political appointees — rarely the same ones twice — have mostly taken the hits that were reserved for administration officials.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the notion that there is no plan for what to do next with Abrego Garcia seemed preposterous. And Judge Xinis called it out: “Now you will have me believe that a desk officer will quarterback where Mr. Abrego Garcia goes and what they do next.”\n\nBased on her comments in court, Xinis seemed most likely to issue an order effectively blocking the administration for at least a short period of time from moving Abrego Garcia to a far-flung location in the United States or to a third country. Her remarks signaled that over the course of the case, Xinis’ skepticism toward the administration has ripened into full-blown disbelief: “If past is prologue, Mr. Abrego Garcia will be moved … and before we know it he’s on a plane and I’ve lost jurisdiction.”",

    "News_title":"What It Means to Be a Mystic Girl",
    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nWhen I was little, I asked God for straight hair. I begged him to persuade my ballet instructor to let me danceen pointeinstead of holding me back to give my ankles another year to strengthen. And I prayed that my parents would send me to Camp Mystic.\n\nThese are the kinds of things girls think about and talk about with one another, and with God. I grew up in Austin, Texas, and every third girl I knew went to Mystic, the Christian girls’ camp that was devastated by flooding last week. Every year a camper goes, she gets a letter made of felt to bring home, representing one of the camp’s two “tribes”—Tfor Tonkawa orKfor Kiowa. I had one of my first tastes of jealousy in seeing the string of red letters grow, summer after summer, on my childhood best friend’s bulletin board. When I got to the University of Texas, my sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, was full of women who had gone to Mystic.\n\nThe Mystic Girls always said they have an unbreakable bond, one that lasts through life. Many campers dreamed that someday, their own daughters would attend; mothers would put their daughters on the Mystic waiting list right after the babies were born. My friends’ mothers and aunts spoke of the 99-year-old camp with the same reverence they usually reserved for Jesus: His glory. His presence. The Almighty.Mystic.\n\n“It’s hard not to feel like you are surrounded by a higher power when you’re down there, because it’s just so beautiful,” my friend Olivia Marrus told me. Olivia went to Mystic for 10 summers—nine as a camper and one as a counselor. And it’s true that Mystic had the best kind of Texas landscape: old cypress, live oak, and pecan trees; soft grasses; the cool Guadalupe River running through what is known as “Flash Flood Alley.”\n\n[Elizabeth Bruenig: An inhospitable land]\n\nMost nights, campers take turns leading a devotional. “You’re asking things out loud, and you’re not afraid to work through problems together,” Olivia recalled when I spoke with her this week.\n\n“If God is real, why did this boy say something mean to me?”\n\n“If God is real, why didn’t I get Head Belle on the Highland Park Belles team?”\n\nIf God is real, why were at least 27 campers and counselors at Mystic swept into the Guadalupe and killed?\n\nMany people don’t understandwhat summer camp means to Texans. It is not just a way to keep kids occupied when school is out of session and the heat makes you feel like you can’t breathe. It’s a way of life. And Mystic is one of the oldest and most prestigious camps in the Texas Hill Country. Former First Lady Laura Bush was a counselor. President Lyndon B. Johnson’s daughters, granddaughters, and great-granddaughters attended. Campers have included the daughters of three Texas governors. My parents, transplants from the Northeast, didn’t understand why a summer camp was so expensive.\n\nMystic might sound stuffy, but my friends often say it was the place in the world where they felt the most free, the most uninhibited—a place where faces were freckled and untouched by makeup. There were no electronics. No boys. No parents. The camp offered archery, riflery, horseback riding, basketball, and competitive canoeing. The refrain I’ve heard repeated in texts, Instagram posts, and prayers since the July 4 flood is “Mystic is love.” Olivia told me that campers sang all the time, everywhere. They sang even in the back of a school bus last week— “That’s how it is with God’s love (praise God!) \/ Once you’ve experienced it \/ You spread his love to everyone \/ You want to pass it on”—as they were evacuated out of the destruction.\n\nMystic knew that campers would come back summer after summer, so the same group of girls always shared a cabin, with names such as Bubble Inn and Giggle Box. The oldest campers were called aides; a year later, many of those girls returned as counselors. Counselors who came for three years were rewarded with the ultimate keepsake: a Mystic ring, a gold, cursiveCMforever branding the owner a Mystic Girl.\n\nLike every self-contained world, Mystic has its own vernacular, its own logic. People understandably want to search for blame after a tragedy, to find a reason for the catastrophe. Some have asked if Mystic could have been better prepared for this disaster.Why, people have wondered,were the cabins of the youngest campers so close to the river?\n\nIt’s easy to say now that they shouldn’t have been, but the cabins were close to the river for reasons both symbolic and rational. Little girls stayed on the “flats” and worked their way up the hill as they aged. The cabins on the flats were closest to the nurse’s office, where campers could go if they were ill or just homesick.\n\nA small creek separated the senior commons from the rest of camp. During really big rains, the creek could flood, and the bridge that crossed it could become impassable. But Mystic was prepared for that. Girls could access a shed of food in the senior commons until they could get back to the rest of camp. In her 10 years, Olivia never experienced a rain big enough to flood the creek, let alone the river.\n\n“Nobody ever talked about the Guadalupe flooding,” she said. “That was just so not something that was even plausible to anyone. Why would you even think that? Big rain was just a rainy day: Stay in your cabins. Hang out with your friends. Play cards.”\n\nAlthough Texas seems to be perpetually in a drought, storms aren’t abnormal. I have gotten more flash-flood alerts during my life in Central Texas than I can count. My brother and I used to cheer when the roads flooded enough for us to go “puddling”—driving through the deepest ditches so water would splash all the way up onto the car’s roof. (As our mom would point out, this isn’t safe.) So I wasn’t immediately alarmed when I heard the first reports of flooding near Mystic. Neither was Olivia. The realization that this was not just another big rain hit her when she saw a video of a cabin from a nearby boys’ camp floating down the Guadalupe. I began to understand only when I was told that a girl I once babysat was missing.\n\nOlivia’s phone exploded with text messages from former and current campers and counselors:I feel like I’m gonna throw up. I’m sick to my stomach. What the fuck is going on?\n\n“We were taught to deal with most situations,” Olivia said. “Are you taught to deal with a hundred-year flood? No, because how do you teach anyone to deal with that?”\n\nOlivia imagined what it must have been like to be there when the water rose, in the place that had been her reprieve from every bad thing that had ever happened to her, the place that had helped her believe in God. “You can see yourself being the counselor who’s terrified, trying to get her girls to safety. You can feel yourself being a 9-year-old, four days into camp, being terrified. You can put yourself in the shoes of any person that was there,” Olivia said. She “could have been you.”\n\nPeople want to find the villains responsible for the tragedy at Mystic—state or federal agencies, the camp, the government, the world—because they want to hold someone accountable, to make sure such a disaster never happens again. But also, they don’t want to confront the idea that, maybe, God permits such unimaginable cruelty.\n\nMore than 160 people are still missing from the floods across Central Texas, some of them Mystic campers. Early in the week, families and friends were posting photos of the girls they were looking for on Instagram. Now they are posting tributes to their memories. As each day passes, the likelihood that there will be no more survivors settles across the region.\n\n“This thing that happened is so unprecedented and unbelievable,” Olivia said. “I never felt anything but so safe and cared for at camp.” Mystic, she went on, “gave me my best friends. It gave me the happiest memories. It gave me a lifetime of lessons.”\n\nFor nearly a century, Mystic has taught girls to be brave, confident, intelligent, fun, and kind. It taught them that God is everywhere and that friendship is everything. They need those lessons now more than ever. Maybe we all do.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

Overall, at least 166 people remain missing statewide.\n\nTexas community continues to grieve, works to assess damages after flood event\n\nAustin Dixon, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, announced the first wave of funding during a press conference Friday morning.\n\n“Over 100,000 individual donors have already made a gift online, by mail, by phone, and most meaningfully to us in person, by just showing up at our office to support the fund,” Dixon said.\n\nThe $5 million in initial grants will be distributed across four areas: $1.25 million for direct support to individuals and families, $1.25 million for local businesses, $1.25 million for first responder agencies, and $1.25 million for crisis response operations.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chip Roy praised the rapid response, calling it unprecedented in his experience.\n\n“I’ve never seen that kind of immediacy in getting relief to the people who need it,” Roy said. “Your dollars are immediately getting into people’s hands.”\n\nMajor donors include H-E-B, which contributed $2 million, and James Avery artisan jewelry company, which donated $500,000. Dr. Chris Avery, chairman of the James Avery board, announced an additional $500,000 commitment to various organizations and charities.\n\nWhy Texans are calling H-E-B the ‘FEMA of Texas’ after devastating floods\n\n“Our company roots run deep, our people, our values and our story are all tied to this community,” Avery said, noting the company’s particular connection to Camp Mystic, where his family has attended for generations since the 1950s.\n\nThe tourism-dependent region faces significant economic challenges. Mindy Wendele with the Kerrville Chamber of Commerce said more than 1,100 people work in the hospitality industry locally.\n\n“When those folks, many of those folks, are displaced, it is a trickle down effect of how it affects all of us,” Wendele said.\n\nThe chamber foundation received $700,000 to provide emergency cash grants to small businesses. Amy Hereford, president and CEO of LiftFund, said her organization mobilized more than $1.6 million in relief funding.\n\n“National data shows that 40% of small businesses will permanently close if they can’t get access to funding within the first two weeks of disaster,” Hereford said.\n\nResources for Texans affected by flooding: Find shelter, supplies and assistance\n\nFirst responders continue search and recovery operations along an 8-mile stretch of the Guadalupe River. Lee Pool, chief of the Hunt Volunteer Fire Department, received $750,000 total — $250,000 unrestricted and $500,000 specifically for cash assistance to Hunt area residents.\n\n“God is present in Kerr County. God is present in people’s hearts. It’s obvious,” Pool said.\n\nCrisis counseling services are being provided by the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team. Josh Holland, international director, said volunteer chaplains have been on-site since July 4.\n\n“We have crisis trained chaplains that deploy and offer emotional and spiritual care, sharing God’s love with people that are going through some of the most devastating events imaginable,” Holland said.\n\nMajor Phil Swyers from the Salvation Army said his organization plans to operate disaster assistance for up to two years or until the need is met.\n\nThe Community Foundation emphasized this represents only the beginning of long-term recovery efforts in the region.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Starlin was sent to the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 2005, where Hurricane Katrina made its deadly landfall. That, he said, is an example of the worst-case scenario.\n\nFlooding in the Triad created impassable roads.

For at least the first three days, you’ve gotta be self-sufficient because it’s going to take that long to get … help,” he said.\n\nStarlin points to the devastation from Hurricane Helene. It took days for anyone to get to the people trapped following the unprecedented mudslides.\n\n“Get your go bag, which is your get out of dodge bag. Keep that handy,” he said. “Tornadoes, you gotta go now.

    "News_title":"DOGE sprouts in red states, as governors embrace the cost-cutter brand and make it their own",
    "News_text":"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The brash and chaotic first days of PresidentDonald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, once led by the world's richest manElon Musk, spawned state-level DOGE mimicry as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show they are in step with their party's leader.\n\nGovernors have always made political hay out of slashing waste or taming bureaucracy, but DOGE has, in some ways, raised the stakes for them to show that they are zealously committed to cutting costs.

    "News_text":"The U.S. Army is expanding its relationship with Palantir.\n\nThe service is also planning to introduce a new artificial intelligence (AI)-centric job field for soldiers.\n\nPalantir isn't cheap, but offers a compelling opportunity for those with a long investing time horizon.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been around in some form or fashion for over 50 years, but recent developments in the field ofgenerative AIhave attracted the attention of Wall Street and Main Street alike. These new AI systems have the ability to refine and distill massive amounts of data, create original content, and streamline processes -- thereby increasing productivity. Potential applications abound, and individuals, businesses, and governments are all looking for ways to cash in on AI.\n\nOne of the undeniable beneficiaries of this trend isPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR). The company has risen from near obscurity to be one of Wall Street's hottest properties. The stock is up 85% so far this year and boasts gains of 1,760% since the dawn of generative AI in late 2022.\n\nWhile some investors fear Palantir's growth will eventually fade, recent developments help illustrate the long runway ahead and why the stock might still be a buy, despite its astronomical valuation.\n\nInvestors may recall that in May 2024, Palantir was awarded a $480 million, five-year contract by the U.S. Army for its Maven Smart System. The system integrates data from satellites, drones, and other intelligence sources, using AI and computer vision to scan the battlefield and identify enemy targets. The cutting-edge system also helps prioritize and track the movement of enemy systems, as well as identifying friendly forces in the area. By providing real-time data, Maven gives analysts actionable intelligence.\n\nMilitary leaders were so impressed with the system that in September, they added a $99.8 million addendum to the contract, expanding access to the Maven system across all branches of the U.S. military, including the Army, Air Force, Space Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The expanded access improves the interaction and operational capabilities between different branches of the service.\n\nThere's more. By May 2025, Pentagon leaders boosted the contract value by an additional $792 million over four years, bringing the total value of the project to more than $1.3 billion through 2029. A defense official cited the \"growing demand\" for the system as the catalyst for the increasing contract size.\n\nThis contract is only one of many, but it helps to illustrate one of Palantir's secret weapons: that of \"increasing demand.\" When users -- militaryorenterprise -- get their hands on Palantir's systems and actually use them, they begin to understand the myriad ways the system can be deployed. This leads to new users and additional use cases, and ultimately leads to Palantir expanding its relationships with existing customers.\n\nFinally, word broke this week that the U.S. Army is \"laying the groundwork for a sweeping expansion of its AI capabilities,\" according to Military.com. The service is developing a military occupational specialty (MOS) focused on AI. The career field, designated 49B, will be focused on AI and machine learning, which shows that the U.S. military is increasingly betting on AI as the future of modern warfare. As a leading provider of AI tools to the U.S. Army, Palantir will likely benefit from this development.\n\nPalantir introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in April 2023, which helps businesses \"leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) on their own privately held datasets.\" The company then adopted a strategy that has proven wildly successful since its introduction. To capitalize on the unprecedented demand for AIP, the company began hosting boot camps, \"immersive, hands-on-keyboard sessions\" that pair customers with Palantir engineers, which allows them to \"go from zero to use case in just one to five days.\"\n\nBecause users experience the platform firsthand, they quickly understand the value AIP can bring to their organization and its ability to solve company-specific business challenges. Furthermore, once these AI systems are established within an organization, chances are good that the company will ultimately expand its relationship with Palantir.\n\nDon't take my word for it. In the first quarter, Palantir's revenue of $884 million grew 39% year over year and 7% quarter over quarter -- but that only tells part of the story. U.S. commercial revenue, which includes AIP, grew 71% year over year and 19% quarter over quarter, and now accounts for 41% of Palantir's total sales -- not bad for a product that's only been around for about two years.\n\nThere's more good news: Palantir's so-called \"Rule of 40\" score, which evaluates the company's revenue growth inrelationto its profits, clocks in at 83%, showing a healthy balance of growth and profitability. That's up from just 38% less than two years ago and illustrates the quality of Palantir's earnings.\n\nTo close out the quarter, Palantir's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or contractually obligated sales that haven't been recognized as revenue, jumped 46% to a record $1.9 billion, while the remaining deal value (RDV) of its U.S. commercial segment soared 127% to $2.32 billion. This gives investors visibility into Palantir's future and helps illustrate that its growth streak still has room to run.\n\nPalantir's track record of success and the unprecedented demand for its services come with a hefty price tag. The stock currently sells for a lofty 82 times forward sales and 234 times forward earnings. This is enough to make some investors run for cover, but the most commonly used valuation metrics tend to struggle with high-growth stocks.\n\nBecause of its high multiples, Palantir stock is prone to wild swings of volatility and, as such, won't be a good fit for every investor. However, as my colleagueAdia Cimino points out, valuations don't provide a complete picture, and \"If you refused to buy these companies because of their high valuations, you might have missed out on owning some of the world's most successful technology stocks.\"\n\nThere's little question that the adoption of AI is just getting started. Given Palantir's industry-leading government and enterprise-level AI solutions and its track record of expanding relationships, I would posit that these recent developments could help drive the stock to new heights. Those concerned about its valuation should consider buying just a small stake to start, or dollar-cost averaging into a position over time.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

    "News_title":"This tech CEO quit to redesign the 155mm shell — and upend how the West buys its weapons",
    "News_text":"Tiberius Aerospace unveiled Sceptre, a 155mm artillery shell with an extended range.\n\nThe startup's open-platform model licenses the design to governments for local production.\n\nIt's an approach that challenges traditional defense procurement, aiming at agility and innovation.\n\nA few weeks ago, a new defense tech startup stepped out of the shadows with a bold claim: it had built a radically advanced 155mm artillery shell called Sceptre.\n\nThe ammo quickly grabbed attention for its promised combination of unprecedented range and precision.\n\nBut its creator, tech entrepreneur Chad Steelberg, believes the real innovation isn't necessarily what Sceptre does — it's how it's made and sold.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Steelberg described Sceptre as an open weapons platform: licensed to governments, built locally, and updated like software.\n\nThis frees up Tiberius Aerospace — his startup — to focus on R&D rather than managing huge manufacturing contracts.\n\nIt's a model born not in a defense industry boardroom, but in the logic of Silicon Valley and the battlefields of Ukraine — one built for speed, iteration, and scale.\n\nThe proposal is a radical step away from the highly centralized, slow-moving defense industrial base and contracting and acquisition processes that the Pentagon and other Western countries are wedded to, and it's sparked a mixture of curiosity and skepticism.\n\nIn late 2024, sickened by the Russian onslaught in Ukraine, Steelberg made a decision. He stepped down as CEO of the AI firm he had cofounded, Veritone, and handed the keys to his No.2.\n\n\"I gave them four months' notice\" before founding Tiberius Aerospace, he told BI.\n\nHe knew nothing about aerospace back then, he said. But he knew people who did, bringing in a Navy SEAL commander, a former Apple hardware lead, and a top engineer from Raytheon.\n\n\"You get the best people in the world,\" Steelberg said. \"You put 'em in a room, lock the box, and say: let's solve this problem.\"\n\nThat led to Sceptre, a rocket-propelled 155mm artillery shell that Steelberg says can hit targets up to 95 miles away— nearly triple the range of standard rounds — with precision, even in GPS-denied environments.\n\nThe munition itself has undergone test firing on a M777 in the US.\n\nGiven its differences from standard rounds (those without rocket assist) — which have a range of about 15 miles and require add-ons for rocket propulsion and precision guidance — it's a category-defying munition more comparable to an extended-range GMLRS. But, like the original 155mm round, it's fired from a howitzer.\n\nIn artillery battles, range is critical; after all, that's part of the reason the HIMARS, a rocket artillery system, was so effective when it initially arrived in Ukraine: it gave Kyiv's forces much-needed reach in combat. Steelberg says it will \"change the balance of power\" on the Ukrainian battlefield and beyond, though it would need to be widely fielded first.\n\nTiberius won't actually be manufacturing Sceptre, offering an unusual \"defense-as-a-service\" model.\n\nThe company plans to license the design to governments, which will pay $5 million upfront to gain manufacturing rights, and then $2.5 million a year to stay on board and get continual updates.\n\nThey can then produce the munition in-country, using their own supply chains and industrial base.\n\nWhat makes this possible is Tiberius opening up its specifications for individual components — like batteries, guidance units, and fuel systems — to outside suppliers.\n\nSteelberg said suppliers will be encouraged to propose improvements, as long as the component fits within Sceptre's volumetric space.\n\n\"We will certify it, test it, fire it on the range, qualify it as a version if it passes safety and efficacy,\" he said.\n\nThis creates competition and choice for the governments buying it, he argued.\n\nIt's a model inspired by the early days of Intel, leaning on an open architecture, Steelberg said. While major companies like Boeing regularly bring in subcontractors to provide parts, Tiberius' platform is built around encouraging an ongoing ecosystem around this logic — almost like an app store for defence tech, with Sceptre at its core.\n\nHe suggested this would give governments the freedom to choose small, nimble manufacturers, support their own defense ecosystems, and reduce reliance on a handful of major contractors.\n\nGovernments place an order — keeping the intellectual property — for the version of Sceptre they end up making.\n\nThe bulk of Sceptre's main parts can be manufactured on simple, widely available CNC machines. This, Steelberg argues, cuts out the need for much of the heavy-duty facilities typically involved in munitions production and opens it up to much smaller players.\n\n\"So now they're actually allocating dollars to support not just the end weapon they're looking for, but actually the industries and the providers that manufactured it,\" he said.\n\nThe result, in his view, is a system that's more agile, more resilient, and better suited to modern warfare, where needs change faster than traditional procurement can keep up with.\n\nAs NATO countries scramble to rebuild their arsenals, the limits of the traditional procurement system are becoming harder to ignore.\n\n\"In terms of ammunition, Russia produces in three months what the whole of NATO produces in a year,\" NATO secretary-general, Mark Rutte, warned recently.\n\nAutocratic regimes like Russia's can command industry at will. Democracies can't — and procurement systems built for peacetime tend to move at a glacial pace.\n\nIn broad-brush terms: a government commissions a giant contractor, a timeline and price are agreed, and five, ten, twenty years later, a product rolls off the line.\n\nThat model shuts out smaller players almost entirely.\n\n\"The big, big problem honestly is that there's been a co-evolution of ministries of defense and big prime manufacturers,\" Steelberg said, describing it as \"an intellectual and contractual moat that prevents anyone else from getting in.\"\n\nIt's known asthe \"valley of death,\"where few new players can easily navigate Pentagon bureaucracy, or can bank on being around long enough to secure a contract.\n\nDOD is experimenting with newer and nimbler models — such as open platforms and schemes to partner with smaller companies — but nothing quite to the scale that Tiberius envisions.\n\nPaul Hough, a UK-based expert in defense procurement,shares Steelberg's calls for a shake-up of the system.\n\n\"Before we start pushing tsunamis of money through the old procurement model and the old industrial base structure, we should stop, take a breath,\" he told BI.\n\nThe yawning gap between promising prototypes from small companies and actual military adoption is further complicated by the fact that innovation increasingly comes from the private sector.\n\nIn the 1960s, governments funded around 60% of global R&D, according to Casey Purley, director of the Pentagon's Army Applications Laboratory.

    "News_title":"This tech CEO quit to redesign the 155mm shell — and upend how the West buys its weapons",
    "News_text":"Tiberius Aerospace unveiled Sceptre, a 155mm artillery shell with an extended range.\n\nThe startup's open-platform model licenses the design to governments for local production.\n\nIt's an approach that challenges traditional defense procurement, aiming at agility and innovation.\n\nA few weeks ago, a new defense tech startup stepped out of the shadows with a bold claim: it had built a radically advanced 155mm artillery shell called Sceptre.\n\nThe ammo quickly grabbed attention for its promised combination of unprecedented range and precision.\n\nBut its creator, tech entrepreneur Chad Steelberg, believes the real innovation isn't necessarily what Sceptre does — it's how it's made and sold.\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, Steelberg described Sceptre as an open weapons platform: licensed to governments, built locally, and updated like software.\n\nThis frees up Tiberius Aerospace — his startup — to focus on R&D rather than managing huge manufacturing contracts.\n\nIt's a model born not in a defense industry boardroom, but in the logic of Silicon Valley and the battlefields of Ukraine — one built for speed, iteration, and scale.\n\nThe proposal is a radical step away from the highly centralized, slow-moving defense industrial base and contracting and acquisition processes that the Pentagon and other Western countries are wedded to, and it's sparked a mixture of curiosity and skepticism.\n\nIn late 2024, sickened by the Russian onslaught in Ukraine, Steelberg made a decision. He stepped down as CEO of the AI firm he had cofounded, Veritone, and handed the keys to his No.2.\n\n\"I gave them four months' notice\" before founding Tiberius Aerospace, he told BI.\n\nHe knew nothing about aerospace back then, he said. But he knew people who did, bringing in a Navy SEAL commander, a former Apple hardware lead, and a top engineer from Raytheon.\n\n\"You get the best people in the world,\" Steelberg said. \"You put 'em in a room, lock the box, and say: let's solve this problem.\"\n\nThat led to Sceptre, a rocket-propelled 155mm artillery shell that Steelberg says can hit targets up to 95 miles away— nearly triple the range of standard rounds — with precision, even in GPS-denied environments.\n\nThe munition itself has undergone test firing on a M777 in the US.\n\nGiven its differences from standard rounds (those without rocket assist) — which have a range of about 15 miles and require add-ons for rocket propulsion and precision guidance — it's a category-defying munition more comparable to an extended-range GMLRS. But, like the original 155mm round, it's fired from a howitzer.\n\nIn artillery battles, range is critical; after all, that's part of the reason the HIMARS, a rocket artillery system, was so effective when it initially arrived in Ukraine: it gave Kyiv's forces much-needed reach in combat. Steelberg says it will \"change the balance of power\" on the Ukrainian battlefield and beyond, though it would need to be widely fielded first.\n\nTiberius won't actually be manufacturing Sceptre, offering an unusual \"defense-as-a-service\" model.\n\nThe company plans to license the design to governments, which will pay $5 million upfront to gain manufacturing rights, and then $2.5 million a year to stay on board and get continual updates.\n\nThey can then produce the munition in-country, using their own supply chains and industrial base.\n\nWhat makes this possible is Tiberius opening up its specifications for individual components — like batteries, guidance units, and fuel systems — to outside suppliers.\n\nSteelberg said suppliers will be encouraged to propose improvements, as long as the component fits within Sceptre's volumetric space.\n\n\"We will certify it, test it, fire it on the range, qualify it as a version if it passes safety and efficacy,\" he said.\n\nThis creates competition and choice for the governments buying it, he argued.\n\nIt's a model inspired by the early days of Intel, leaning on an open architecture, Steelberg said. While major companies like Boeing regularly bring in subcontractors to provide parts, Tiberius' platform is built around encouraging an ongoing ecosystem around this logic — almost like an app store for defence tech, with Sceptre at its core.\n\nHe suggested this would give governments the freedom to choose small, nimble manufacturers, support their own defense ecosystems, and reduce reliance on a handful of major contractors.\n\nGovernments place an order — keeping the intellectual property — for the version of Sceptre they end up making.\n\nThe bulk of Sceptre's main parts can be manufactured on simple, widely available CNC machines. This, Steelberg argues, cuts out the need for much of the heavy-duty facilities typically involved in munitions production and opens it up to much smaller players.\n\n\"So now they're actually allocating dollars to support not just the end weapon they're looking for, but actually the industries and the providers that manufactured it,\" he said.\n\nThe result, in his view, is a system that's more agile, more resilient, and better suited to modern warfare, where needs change faster than traditional procurement can keep up with.\n\nAs NATO countries scramble to rebuild their arsenals, the limits of the traditional procurement system are becoming harder to ignore.\n\n\"In terms of ammunition, Russia produces in three months what the whole of NATO produces in a year,\" NATO secretary-general, Mark Rutte, warned recently.\n\nAutocratic regimes like Russia's can command industry at will. Democracies can't — and procurement systems built for peacetime tend to move at a glacial pace.\n\nIn broad-brush terms: a government commissions a giant contractor, a timeline and price are agreed, and five, ten, twenty years later, a product rolls off the line.\n\nThat model shuts out smaller players almost entirely.\n\n\"The big, big problem honestly is that there's been a co-evolution of ministries of defense and big prime manufacturers,\" Steelberg said, describing it as \"an intellectual and contractual moat that prevents anyone else from getting in.\"\n\nIt's known asthe \"valley of death,\"where few new players can easily navigate Pentagon bureaucracy, or can bank on being around long enough to secure a contract.\n\nDOD is experimenting with newer and nimbler models — such as open platforms and schemes to partner with smaller companies — but nothing quite to the scale that Tiberius envisions.\n\nPaul Hough, a UK-based expert in defense procurement,shares Steelberg's calls for a shake-up of the system.\n\n\"Before we start pushing tsunamis of money through the old procurement model and the old industrial base structure, we should stop, take a breath,\" he told BI.\n\nThe yawning gap between promising prototypes from small companies and actual military adoption is further complicated by the fact that innovation increasingly comes from the private sector.\n\nIn the 1960s, governments funded around 60% of global R&D, according to Casey Purley, director of the Pentagon's Army Applications Laboratory. Today, she says it's about 20%, with commercial firms — often tech companies — picking up the slack.\n\n\"From AI to robotics, we need to work with companies we historically haven't,\" she told a recent conference in London.\n\nCynthia Cook, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that Steelberg's model \"does have the potential for production where some parts are made by primarily commercial suppliers.\n\n\"This could be a way of engaging the full industrial base beyond the more narrow slice of companies that are understood to be defense contractors,\" she told BI.\n\nCapt.

    "News_text":"By Mike Dolan\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today\n\nBy Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Finance and Markets\n\nAlthough markets are trying to shrug off the week's U.S. tariff threats as yet another negotiation tactic, there's growing unease at the daily barrage, the latest being a 35% tariff on Canadian goods and higher levies on other countries.\n\nIt's Friday, so today I'll provide a quick overview of what's happening in global markets and then offer you some weekend reading suggestions away from the headlines.\n\nToday's Market Minute\n\n* U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his tariff assault on Canada on Thursday, saying the U.S. would impose a 35% tariff on imports next month and planned to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most other trading partners.\n\n* The 50% tariff that the Trump administration has slapped on Brazilian imports has rattled the global coffee market and could make the price of a cup of coffee in the U.S. jump beyond recent highs, and will likely raise prices for beef used in American hamburgers\n\n* Bitcoin rallied to an all-time high on Friday, powered by demand from institutional investors and crypto-friendly policies from Trump's administration.\n\n* U.S. corn exports and export sales are still on fire despite the imminent ramp-up of Brazil’s corn shipping season, meaning the U.S. government might need to up its export target yet again. Read the latest from ROI agriculture columnist Karen Braun.\n\n* Utilities across the European Union cranked output from natural gas and coal-fired power plants during the opening half of 2025, boosting power sector emissions and reversing recent energy transition momentum, says ROI columnist Gavin Maguire.\n\nCanada back in tariff crosshairs\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. would impose the 35% tariff next month on Canadian imports not covered by the United States-Canada-Mexico pact and planned to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most other trading partners.\n\nThat comes on top of 50% tariff pledges on copper and Brazilian imports, which are set to lift the U.S. price of the metal and coffee, among other goods.\n\nIt also adds to the planned 25% tariffs on Japan and South Korea, and doused optimism of a more favorable deal with the European Union as investors awaited word on what levies Trump would assign the EU later on Friday.\n\nAfter Wall Street stock indexes hit record closing highs on Thursday, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures fell back ahead of today's bell. European and Japanese shares were in the red and the Canadian dollar slipped to two-week lows.\n\nSomewhat weary of the seemingly endless back-and-forth on tariffs and attempting to look beyond the short-term headlines, investors are wary of overreacting as they brace for almost three weeks of 'ifs' and 'buts' ahead of the new August 1 deadline.\n\nThe effect on economic activity and prices may take months to materialize. In a thin week for data, the weekly jobless update remained robust.\n\nThe inflation impact is perhaps most immediate, but Thursday's long-bond auction matched decent demand for the 10-year note sale earlier in the week.\n\nFederal Reserve easing expectations slipped back a touch, however, and both ten- and thirty-year yields ticked higher. Alongside gains against the Canadian dollar, the greenback's index firmed more broadly.\n\nFed officials struck a relatively benign tone. Arch dove Christopher Waller restated his preference for cutting rates again later this month, while saying the Fed's balance sheet run-off had some way to go. \"We're just too tight and we could consider cutting the policy rate in July,\" he said.\n\nSan Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly said she still sees two rate cuts over the remainder of the year.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, upped its attack on Fed Chair Jerome Powell - this time over the Fed's accounts and spending on its HQ renovations.\n\nBut tech and the artificial intelligence theme continued to enthuse stock investors, with Taiwan chip giant TSMC beating forecasts on its AI chip demand and Nvidia closing above a $4 trillion valuation for the first time on Thursday.\n\nThe second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear next week, with Delta Air Lines shares rallying 12% on Thursday after the carrier forecast third-quarter and full-year profit above Wall Street estimates. That lifted the broader airline sector.\n\nThe other big market gainer was Bitcoin, which rallied to an all-time high on Friday - powered by demand from institutional investors and Trump's crypto-friendly policies.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency rose to a peak of $116,781.10 in the Asian session, taking its gains for the year so far to more than 24%. Gold was firmer too on the tariff jitters.\n\nIn China, a Shanghai regulator said it held a meeting this week for local government officials to consider strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies - a marked shift in tone for China where crypto trading is banned.\n\nBracing for GDP updates next week, Chinese shares bucked the downbeat global stock mood on Friday and pushed higher.\n\nElsewhere, sterling ebbed on a surprising monthly contraction in UK GDP, with jitters about Britain's public finances nudging gilt yields higher as finance minister Rachel Reeves prepares for the set-piece Mansion House speech next week.\n\nIn company news, BP's second-quarter results are expected to be affected by lower prices received for gas and oil, while its upstream output is set to be higher than previously forecast, the company said in a trading update on Friday ahead of results due on August 5.\n\nIn the euro zone, European Central Bank hawk Isabel Schnabel said the hurdle for another ECB interest rate cut is \"very high\" as the euro zone economy is holding up better than expected despite uncertainty over trade.\n\nWeekend reads\n\n* RETURN TO ZERO: The prospect of the Federal Reserve once again setting interest rates near zero in coming years remains real despite today's relatively high short-term borrowing costs, according to a paper published jointly between the New York and San Francisco Feds this week. The paper, which counted New York Fed chief John Williams as a co-author, extracted measures of risk of hitting the so-called \"zero lower bound\" from financial derivatives, and found a near one-in-ten chance of a return to zero from seven years and beyond - similar to levels in 2018. While expected rates are higher than back then, the level of uncertainty around the outlook is also much higher, it said.\n\n* 'OFFSHORING' MIGRANTS: The Trump administration's approach to offshoring asylum seekers and migrants is unprecedented, but there is a \"sordid history\" of extraterritorial detention centers both in the United States and around the world, writes Professor David Scott Fitzgerald in Foreign Affairs magazine. Describing offshore immigration processing and detention as \"forms of disappearance\", he said the major question globally is how domestic and international law pushes back against a \"race to the bottom\" after last month's U.S. Supreme Court ruling on deportations to South Sudan. \"Rich countries around the world are watching one another for policy models.\"\n\n* POLITICAL ECONOMY RETHINK: The phasing out of green investment subsidies in Trump's successful fiscal bill challenges basic theories of political economy as many Republican lawmakers voted against their constituents' economic interests, writes Harvard economist Dani Rodrik in Project Syndicate. \"It was ideas about what is important and how the world works, rather than economic lobbies or vested interests, that prevailed,\" he wrote, adding there's a broader lesson here about political economy. Narratives can be as important as interest-group politics in gaining traction for a party's agenda, he concludes, and Democrats may have to learn this too.\n\n* COMMUNICATING SCENARIOS: Threats to central bank independence have mounted since the inflation spikes of recent years and amid losses on expanded balance sheets, but the inflation-targeting process should still best illustrate the benefits of keeping political interference at arm's length. So concludes a piece on CEPR's VoxEU site by Fed economist Michael Kiley and Columbia University professor Frederic Mishkin. Regular public communication is needed to explain the process and retain political support, with greater use of scenario analysis likely to be helpful in this regard.\n\n* CHINA AUTO DEVELOPMENT SPEED: Over just one weekend, engineers at Chinese automaker Chery planned an overhaul of the suspension and steering on their Omoda 5 SUV for use on bumpier and more winding European roads. In a Reuters Special Report, Nick Carey and Norihiko Shirouzu show how this makeover exemplifies the disruptive speed and flexibility of Chinese automakers, which have seized control of their home market, the world's largest, from once-dominant foreign competitors. Now, China's auto giants are racing to expand globally, with Chery as the leading exporter and China's largest automaker BYD posing an even bigger long-term competitive threat, industry executives say.\n\nChart of the day\n\nThe 50% tariff that the Trump administration has slapped on Brazilian goods has rattled the global coffee market and could make the price of a cup of coffee in the U.S. jump beyond recent highs. Brazil is the world's largest grower and exporter of coffee, while the U.S. is its biggest client and the world's largest drinker of the beverage, with nearly 200 million Americans having a cup every day.\n\nToday's events to watch\n\n* U.S. June Federal Budget (1400 EDT)\n\n* Canada June employment report (0830 EDT)\n\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

    "News_title":"Democratic socialism is dying. First the socialism, now the democracy",
    "News_text":"What has gone wrong with the Western model of government? You would not guess it from the teeming hordes of people who are clamouring to gain entry into what they obviously see as the most fortunate countries on Earth, but the nations which were once believed to have found the perfect formula for human happiness and fulfilment are slowly but inexorably crashing.\n\nTheir economies – which had been the means of delivering a prosperity that producedunprecedented degrees of personal freedom and satisfaction– are now unsustainable. How have we got here? How could the miracles of enterprise and resourcefulness which had transformed social conditions and individual possibilities just over a century ago be so exhausted that sensible people now speak in terms of outright despair at the prospects for the next generation?\n\nWhat happened was simply this. Over the course of the 20th century, with its terrible wars and traumatic financial catastrophes, the Western political ideal shifted from democratic capitalism to democratic socialism.\n\nThe ruthlessness that the rise of capitalist adventurism required was just about tolerable until the Earth-shaking events of the Depression and two world wars which gave a new force to the idea of collective social responsibility. The charitable movements which had attempted to rescue the poor and unfortunate were no longer enough. There was an almost universal sense that society at large – in the form of elected governments – had a moral obligation to intervene for the wider good.\n\nIn America, this shift was propelled by thestock market crash of 1929and theGreat Depressionthat followed, which produced national trauma of a magnitude which is now almost unimaginable. (My parents’ generation in America spoke of the Depression as if it were a catastrophic biblical event.)\n\nFranklin Roosevelt’s presidency launched welfare programmes – which had once been alien to the national character – and federal work projects to provide illusory employment, but the puritan work ethic meant that there was (and still is) a constant tension between direct government assistance and the sacred American principle of self-reliance.\n\nIn Europe, the context was very different. Here, there had always been a tradition of noblesse oblige: people born with privilege were expected to care about and – in an almost feudal sense – take responsibility for those who did not have their advantages.\n\nAfter the two world wars, there was a newly revived sense of obligation to working class people who had endured danger, hardship and deprivation with such courage and fortitude. Most European countries inaugurated forms of state-sponsored healthcare and social welfare in the years after theSecond World Warwhich displaced the old, largely church-sponsored, agencies. Many of the original hospitals run by the National Health Service were former charitable institutions that had been founded to provide medical care for the poor.\n\nIt became inconceivable, in respectable political discourse, to reject the idea that democratic government had a responsibility to protect all of its citizens from debilitating poverty, treatable illness and gross social disadvantage. Capitalism, administered by a morally responsible government, had to accept this as part of its mission. All of this seems unquestionably admirable: human decency had to prevail over the unfettered “animal spirits” that drive relentless economic progress.\n\nSo what went wrong? Why are our attempts to create an ethically acceptable state, funded by free markets (which is the definition of democratic socialism) becoming untenable? As the identity crisis of the West becomes more deranging, both halves of this idealistic formula – democracy and socialism – are becoming contentious.\n\nThe socialism part has simply turned out to be infinitely expensive. As Kemi Badenoch put it last week, the UK is now in danger of becoming “a welfare state with an economy attached”. Once the principle of relieving poverty became a commitment to removing all wealth inequality, the project was headed for self-destruction.\n\nBy an inexorable process – often propelled by people who did not believe in capitalism or democracy – the goal of eradicating genuine hardship and needless suffering became a much more far-reaching plan for the total transformation of society. Carried to its logical conclusion, this involves extracting so much from the productive forces in the economy that it undermines the very source of the wealth that is meant to be redistributed.\n\nThe Western economies are now in the process of bankrupting themselves in the quest for an ideal state of “fairness” which has undermined the capitalist dynamic of wealth creation. But the “humane” image of a population which is determined to relieve any vestige of disadvantage propels this futile project ever onwards.\n\nThis is a coercive moral trap from which we cannot escape even though its conceptual flaws are clearly visible. Even its most basic principles are controversial: does a “fair” society really meanabolishing all inequalities of wealth? Or offering unquestioned support to all those who claim to need it? What the word “fair” means to most people is “you get out of life pretty much what you put in”. Is there any serious political leader who would be prepared to utter that proposition now?\n\nThe “socialist” half of this formula has become an ever more relentless dogma which the “democracy” half must always serve. Indeed, the common understanding is now that a government is not truly democratic if it does not subscribe to the orthodoxy of economic equality. This new understanding of the function of elected government is being strenuously pushed by those who argue that The Law must take sacred precedence over politics, which may be practised by rogues and opportunists.\n\nThe proponents of this view (like the Attorney General, Lord Hermer)see themselves as defending laws that embody moral absolutes. This concept is borrowed from the US whose Constitution gives such power to the judiciary over elected legislators and presidents. Tony Blair began this emulation of the American system by renaming the Law Lords as the Supreme Court. This has no legitimacy in Britain where Parliament is sovereign and may pass whatever law it sees fit. Perhaps the Hermer doctrine is where democratic socialism was bound to end: the only hope of salvaging socialist principles is to undermine the democratic ones.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Israeli forces have killed at least 110 Palestinians in attacks acrossGazaon Saturday, according to medical sources, including 34 people waiting for food rations at the United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in southern Rafah.\n\nThe killings on Saturday came as progress in ceasefire talks in Qatar stalled and condemnation grew of the Israeli plan to forcibly displace the enclave’s entire population.\n\nIn Rafah, survivors and witnesses said Israeli forces fired directly at Palestinians in the al-Shakoush area, in front of one of the GHF sites, which the United Nations and rights groups have slammed as “human slaughterhouses” and “death traps”.\n\nSamir Shaat, who survived the attack, described “pools of blood” at the GHF site, and said the victims were being shrouded in the bags they had hoped to collect food in.\n\n“The bag meant to be filled with food turned into shrouds. I swear to God it is nothing but a death trap,” he said, sitting next to the body of his friend at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. “They opened gunfire on people in a completely frenzied manner. As I carried my friend over my shoulder, I walked among martyrs.”\n\nMohammad Barbakh, a Palestinian father who also survived the attack, said the victims were killed by Israeli sniper fire.\n\n“They deceive us, letting us come to receive aid. They let us carry the bags, then started shooting at us as if we were ducks being hunted,” he told the AFP news agency.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said Israeli soldiers at the GHF site opened fire without warning.\n\n“The GHF keeps only one aid centre operational in Rafah, forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move to the southern part of Gaza to get food aid,” Tareq said.\n\n“Witnesses report that the Israeli military squarely targeted hungry crowds without prior warning, causing a great deal of panic and fear along with chaotic scenes that erupted following the shooting,” he added.\n\n“The latest attack on aid seekers underscores how no place in Gaza is safe and no act of survival is spared from Israeli strikes.”\n\nAccording to doctors in Gaza, more than 800 Palestinians have been killed and 5,000 others wounded at GHF sites since the group began its operations in late May.\n\n“The vast majority were shot in the head and legs,” said Khalil al-Degran, a spokesperson for Al-Aqsa Hospital. “We are struggling to cope with the overwhelming number of casualties amid a devastating shortage of medical supplies.”\n\nOther Israeli attacks on Saturday included bombings that killed 14 Palestinians in Gaza City, four of them in a residence on Jaffa Street in the Tuffah area. That assault also wounded 10 others.\n\nIsraeli forces also hit two residential buildings in Jabalia in northern Gaza, killing 15 people, according to medical sources. Israeli strikes on the Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, killed seven more people.\n\nIsraeli forces also pounded Beit Hanoon in northern Gaza, dropping nearly 50 bombs on the northeastern part of the city.\n\nThe renewed attacks came as the Israeli military announced that its forces had attacked Gaza 250 times in the last 48 hours. The Israeli military has also continued to restrict the entry of food and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza despite warnings of famine from rights groups.\n\nThe Government Media Office in Gaza said on Saturday that 67 children have now died due to malnutrition. It said 650,000 children under the age of five were also at “real and immediate risk of acute malnutrition in the coming weeks”.\n\n“Over the past three days, we have recorded dozens of deaths due to shortages of food and essential medical supplies, in an extremely cruel humanitarian situation,” the statement read.\n\n“This shocking reality reflects the scale of the unprecedented humanitarian tragedy in Gaza.”\n\nProgress in negotiations between Hamas and Israel to end the war have, meanwhile, stalled, the Reuters and AFP news agencies reported, with the sides disagreeing over the extent of Israeli forces’ withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nA Palestinian source told Reuters that Hamas has objected to the withdrawal maps proposed by Israel, as they would leave about 40 percent of the territory under Israeli occupation, including all of Rafah and other territories in northern and eastern Gaza.\n\nTwo Israeli sources told Reuters that Hamas wanted Israel to retreat to lines it held in a previous ceasefire before it renewed its offensive in March.\n\nA Palestinian source also told the AFP that the Israeli plan would force hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians into a small area near the city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt.\n\n“Hamas’s delegation will not accept the Israeli maps… as they essentially legitimise the reoccupation of approximately half of the Gaza Strip and turn Gaza into isolated zones with no crossings or freedom of movement,” they said.\n\nThe agencies also reported that the two sides were divided on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and guarantees on ending the war. One Palestinian source told Reuters the crisis could be solved with more intervention from the US.\n\nThe indirect talks are expected to continue, despite the latest obstacles. Delegations from Israel and Hamas have been in Qatar since Sunday.\n\nOmar Rahman, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said Israel is unlikely to give in to pressure to reach a ceasefire quickly, because its goals in Gaza extend far beyond returning the captives held by Hamas there.\n\n“It’s been clear since October 2023 that Israel’s ultimate goal here is the physical destruction of Gaza, the engineered collapse of Palestinian society there, and the forcible depopulation of the entirety of the Strip,” Rahman told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe world was seeing the continuation of that strategy, he said, whether through the GHF, which has been “concocted by the Americans and the Israelis to displace the normal lines of aid distribution and then corral the surviving population into very concentrated parts of the Gaza Strip”, or the plan announced by Israeli Minister of Defence Israel Katz to build a so-called “humanitarian city” to house 2.1 million Palestinians on the ruins of Rafah, which has been razed to the ground.\n\nRahman said that framing the proposal as a “humanitarian city” was farcical. “You strip away these euphemisms, and what you have there is a concentration camp,” he said.\n\n“What Israel’s trying to do is create a concentration camp, which is essentially a holding cell until other options open up for it to depopulate that [area].”\n\nPalestinians in Gaza have also rejected the plan and reiterated that they would not leave the enclave, while rights groups, international organisations and several nations have slammed it as laying the ground for “ethnic cleansing” or the forcible removal of a population from its homeland.\n\nIn Israel, political analyst Akiva Eldar told Al Jazeera that the majority of Israelis are “really appalled” by Katz’s plan, which would be “illegal and immoral”.\n\n“Anybody who will participate in this disgusting project will be involved in war crimes,” Eldar said.\n\nThe message underlying the plan, he said, is that “there can’t be two people between the river and the sea, and those who deserve to have a state are only the Jewish people”.\n\nOther analysts told Al Jazeera that the expulsion of Palestinians from their land and their concentration in restricted areas is nothing new.\n\nLorenzo Kamel, a Middle East professor at the University of Turin, noted that Saturday marks the day in 1948 when 70,000 Palestinians were expelled from the village of Lydda during what became known as the “march of death”.\n\n“Many of them ended up in the Gaza Strip,” Kamel said. “This is not something new, but it has accelerated in the past months.”\n\nThe plan to gather the Gaza population on the ruins of Rafah is, therefore, “nothing but another camp in preparation for the deportation from the Gaza Strip”.",

    "News_title":"How Greece and Germany helped make the marvels of archeology modern",
    "News_text":"Watching an American icon like Indiana Jones battle Nazis in “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” it’s hard to believe that it was actually a German cultural institute which played a pivotal role in transforming reckless Jones-style treasure hunting into the modern science of archaeology we know today.\n\nThat institute,the German Archaeological Institute at Athens (DAI Athens), has just completed the year-long celebration of its 150th anniversary — just as Greece welcomes record numbers of summer tourists to marvel at the archaeological wonders the institute helped unearth.\n\nWidely regarded as one of the birthplaces of modern archaeological science, the DAI pioneered the transition from indiscriminate digging at archaeological sites to the systematic excavation and meticulous study that continues to inspire researchers and amateur archaeology buffs across the globe.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, archeology was often more about treasure hunting and indiscriminate looting than detailed research and science.\n\nTake Lord Elgin’s controversial removal ofsculptures from the Parthenonin Athens, between 1801 and 1812.  Although Elgin claimed to have obtained permission from Ottoman authorities — a claim recently refuted by the Turkish government — his sale of the sculptures to the British Museum remains a major cultural and diplomatic dispute between Greece and Britain.\n\nMany view Elgin’s deeds as one of the most notorious colonial-era lootings, alongside famous antiquities brought to museums around the world like the Rosetta Stone.\n\nEven Luigi Palma di Cesnola,the first director of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, was accused of looting classical treasuresfrom Cyprus, where he served as US Consul General in the mid-1860s. Many of the artifacts di Cesnola was said to have plundered were sold, ironically, to the Met itself.\n\nDuring this period, Greece, newly independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, was rich in history but in economic decline owing to decades of war. But it was finally possible for the philhellenists (lovers of Greek culture) to travel to Greece and study its ancient remains. In the later part of the 19th century, Greece’s ancient ruins also became magnets for the era’s great expansionist powers like the United Kingdom and France.\n\nTheir ultimate goal? Securing rights to excavate Greece’s most coveted archaeological sites while bolstering diplomatic ties through what we now call “cultural diplomacy.”\n\nGermany was just one of the many countries aspiring to gain excavation rights in Greece. “The oldest foreign archaeological institute in Athens is the French School of Athens, founded in 1846,” explains Katja Sporn, director of the DAI Athens. “But Greece’s allure was such that many countries fought to establish archaeological institutes at the time. Today, there are 20 foreign institutes based in Athens.”\n\nThe DAI Athens was founded in 1874, just three years after German unification, during a period of growing German nationalism. Part of the German Archaeological Institute based in Berlin, the DAI Athens’ creation reflected the importance of Greek history to Kaiser Wilhelm I and the close political ties between Germany and Greece, whose first king, Otto, hailed from a Bavarian royal family.\n\nMany Germans at the time saw parallels between Greece’s struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire and their own aspirations for national unification. In the same year the DAI Athens was founded, Sporn explains, the “DAI became subordinate to Germany’s Foreign Office “as a permanent base for internationally active research.”\n\nToday, the DAI Athens is housed in a neoclassical building in downtown Athens where an exhibition for its 150th anniversary showcases its storied history. Among the figures featured is Heinrich Schliemann, an “amateur” archaeologist and businessman who promoted archaeology to a wider public by his emblematic excavations in Troy and Mycenae.\n\nThe figure who truly transformed archaeology was the institute’s fourth director, Wilhelm Dörpfeld, who arrived at the DAI Athens in 1887. An architect trained at the excavations in Olympia, Dörpfeld pioneered stratigraphic excavation and both archaeological and architectural documentation methods.\n\nThese revolutionized the field by allowing archaeologists to piece together detailed site histories while preserving them for future study. “Dörpfeld’s work was a turning point,” says Sporn. “Archaeologists then worked methodically rather than destructively.”\n\nNatalia Vogeikoff-Brogan, the Doreen C. Spritzer Director of Archives at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA), agrees. “Dörpfeld’s techniques were taught to archaeologists from Germany, Britain, France and the United States, who then applied and passed them on worldwide,” she says.\n\nThis shift — from looting the ancient world to rigorous excavation and research — became the gold standard, paving the way for discoveries such as the tomb of King Tutankhamen by Howard Carter in 1922 and inspiring the swashbuckling tales of Indiana Jones.\n\nSome 150 years ago, in 1875, the German Kaiserreich began excavating the ancient sanctuary of Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games — and the place from which the Olympic torch is now lit 100 days before the start of the modern Olympics every four years.\n\nOlympia wasn’t just another dig; it was governed by a bilateral treaty between Greece and Germany, setting unprecedented levels of oversight for excavation and preservation. Funded by the German government and backed by King George I of Greece, the dig benefited from both financial investment and diplomatic backing.\n\n“Olympia remains one of the most important archaeological sites in Greece,” says Sporn. The excavation uncovered iconic treasures like sculptures from the Temple of Zeus and the statue of Hermes by Praxiteles, but mainly the actual buildings and places where the famous Olympic games were held in antiquity.\n\nYet the dig — partially overseen by Dörpfeld before he led the DAI — is not only important for what it found, but how it was conducted. An interdisciplinary team,including archaeologists, architects, historians and conservators, ensured a holistic approach to the study of the site and created a global model for archaeological collaborations that remains the gold standard to this day.\n\nStarting from the old excavations in Olympia, the DAI Athens sought to preserve the fragile remnants of Olympia’s past by systematically recording findings and by publishing results in a series of reports. The approach facilitated scholarly research across Europe, shaped future standards for transparency and data-sharing and established archaeology as a rigorous academic discipline.\n\nCrucially, the collaboration with the Greek state ensured that artifacts remained in Greece rather than being shipped off to a museum or private collection abroad, as was common practice at the time. This led to the creation of a dedicated museum at Olympia financed by a Greek patron as early as 1886 — the first on-site museum in the Mediterranean — where the site’s most important finds could be studied and displayed in their original cultural context. Today, museums aligned with excavation sites have become common across the globe.\n\nUltimately, the dig established “responsible excavation” standards and early conservation techniques that remain in practice to this day.\n\nBack then, Olympia’s success sparked fierce competition among nations vying for other important Greek sites. “A rivalry developed between Germany, France and the United States over the most significant excavations,” says Vogeikoff-Brogan.\n\nThey became a battle for prestige among great powers, fueling political alliances between Greece and other countries. For the first time, economic considerations, like trade, would be factored in by Greece to determine who would get the rights to dig the most coveted archaeological sites. Archaeology became an expression not just of Greek national culture — but its newly emerging political might.\n\nThe French secured Delphi, aided by trade negotiations involving, of all things, Zante currants, while the Americans started excavations in Corinth and eventually the Agora in Athens, leveraging political alliances and personal relationships. “Social capital and political connections were just as important as archaeological merit in these decisions,” Vogeikoff-Brogan adds.\n\nThe positive relationship between the Greek state, its people and the DAI Athens faced a severe setback during WWII. The institute’s ties to Nazi Germany through its director being leader of the German Nazi party in Greece deeply damaged its standing in the country — underscoring the entanglement between DAI Athens and Germany’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n“After WWII, it took time for the DAI Athens to regain the trust of the Greek community and reopen,” Sporn explains. The war left lasting scars, and Greeks remained wary of German institutions due to the atrocities committed during the occupation.\n\nMeanwhile, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA) gained prominence in Greece by deliberately distancing itself from politics, establishing itself as another of Greece’s most prominent foreign archaeological and historical education and research institutes.\n\nToday, the DAI Athens has long embraced modernity, digitizing its vast archives for global access and integrating new technologies into its research, particularly in the context of past human-nature relations, ancient land use and climate change. Like all Greek foreign archeological institutions, the DAI works in close collaboration with the Hellenic Ministry of Culture. And by studying how ancient communities adapted to environmental shifts, the institute aims to offer insights into resilience strategies relevant today.\n\n“By examining the past, the DAI Athens continues to research important topics of the present, which may offer perspectives for the future,” Sporn says.\n\nCheryl Ann Novak is deputy chief editor at BHMA International Edition — Wall Street Journal Publishing Partnership",
