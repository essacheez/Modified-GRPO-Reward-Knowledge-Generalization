    "News_title":"Israel kills more than 300 in Gaza in 48 hours as focus intensifies on GHF",
    "News_text":"More than 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the last 48 hours, according to the Gaza Government Media Office, which says Israel has “committed 26 bloody massacres” in that period.\n\nAt least 118 Palestinians were killed and 581 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s Health Ministry said on Thursday. At least 73 of those were killed since dawn, including 33 aid seekers at the controversial Israeli and United States-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundation(GHF) aid sites.\n\nThirteen people were killed when Israeli forces attacked a tent in al-Mawasi in the south, while 16 were killed and many wounded in an attack on Mustafa Hafez School, sheltering displaced people west of Gaza City, medical sources told Al Jazeera.\n\nAhmed Mansour, a displaced Palestinian taking shelter in the school building, said, “We woke up to fierce [Israeli] air strikes. It felt like an earthquake. People say it was a drone attack, but the sound was horrifying, relentless shelling. Missiles were so destructive that they set everything on fire. Victims were left burning for hours without help. There is no one here to save us.”\n\nThe Government Media Office statement on Thursday said the attacks over the last 48 hours had targeted civilians in shelters and displacement centres overcrowded with tens of thousands of displaced people, public rest areas, Palestinian families inside their homes, popular markets and vital civilian facilities, and starving civilians searching for food.\n\nReporting from Deir el-Balah on the latest killings of Palestinians near GHF aid centres, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said, “People described scenes of horror as they wait for hours just hoping to get their hands on basic food supplies, only to be met with sudden and unprovoked gunfire … I’ve been speaking to a number of survivors this morning, and they told me such heartbreaking testimonies and they shared the horrific scenes that unfolded near the GHF-run aid centres.\n\n“They told me that there was no prior warning, no prior indication – just gunfire ripping through the crowd, desperate Palestinians scattered for cover as bullets flew. They told me that emergency services and medical teams were not able to access the area due to the intensity of the gunfire … This absolutely reflects the collapse of the humanitarian landscape here in Gaza,” he added.\n\nUS contractors ostensibly guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza have been using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press news agency.\n\nTwo US contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity, said they were speaking out because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open licence to do whatever they wished.\n\nLater Thursday, GHF released a statement of denial.  “GHF launched an immediate investigation when the Associated Press first brought these allegations to our attention. Based on time-stamped video footage and sworn witness statements, we have concluded that the claims in the AP’s story are categorically false.”\n\n“At no point were civilians under fire at a GHF distribution site. The gunfire heard in the video was confirmed to have originated from the [Israeli military], who was outside the immediate vicinity of the GHF distribution site. It was not directed at individuals, and no one was shot or injured,” it claimed without providing evidence.\n\nA recent report from Israeli outletHaaretzdetailed Israeli troops, in their words, confirming that Israeli soldiers have deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, said the GHF is “not just to replace the humanitarian mechanism run by international organisations for decades in Gaza, but it’s also to apply maximum pressure on the civilian population”. Odeh also noted that Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said this week that too much aid is going to Gaza and that none should enter to ensure an Israeli victory.\n\nDr Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian emergency medicine doctor and professor who has provided healthcare in Gaza for more than 30 years, told Al Jazeera that the GHF operation “is part of the [Israeli military forces]’ and the Israeli government plan to ethnically cleanse and to fulfil their goal of genocide in Gaza”.\n\n“This has nothing to do with alleviating starvation in Gaza,” Gilbert said.\n\nDescribing the aid from GHF as a “drop in the ocean” and a “sham operation”, Gilbert added, “The distribution organisation is aimed at using food as bait to attract starving people, to terrorise them and to kill them. The shooting of people in food lines is a war crime.”\n\nThe UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called for investigations into the killings and wounding of Palestinians trying to access food through GHF. UNRWA notes that while it operated about 400 sites across the besieged enclave, GFH has set up only four “mega-sites”, three in the south and one in central Gaza – none in the north, where conditions are most severe. In a post on X, UNRWA called for the UN to “do the work” in distributing aid.\n\nMore than 130 humanitarian organisations, including Oxfam, Save the Children and Amnesty International, on Tuesday demanded the immediate closure of the GHF, accusing it of facilitating attacks on starving Palestinians.\n\nThe NGOs said Israeli forces and armed groups “routinely” open fire on civilians attempting to access food.\n\nSince the GHF began operations in late May, more than650 Palestinians have been killedwhile seeking aid, and nearly 4,000 have been wounded.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas has said it is studying a new proposal for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, but insisted it is seeking an agreement that would bring an end to Israel’s devastating war.\n\nHamas said in a statement on Wednesday that it had received proposals from the mediators and is holding talks with them to “bridge gaps” to return to the negotiating table and try to reach a ceasefire agreement.\n\nThe Palestinian group said it was aiming for an agreement that would end the Gaza war and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.\n\nThe announcement came a day after US President Donald Trump said Israel had agreed to the ceasefire proposal and urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen. Trump has been increasing pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas to broker a ceasefire and an agreement for the group to release the Israeli captives held in Gaza.",

    "News_title":"Speedballing – the deadly mix of stimulants and opioids – requires a new approach to prevention and treatment",
    "News_text":"Speedballing– the practice of combining a stimulant like cocaine or methamphetamine with an opioid such as heroin or fentanyl – has evolved from a niche subculture to a widespread public health crisis. The practicestems from the early 1900swhen World War I soldiers were often treated with a combination of cocaine and morphine.\n\nOnce associated with high-profile figures likeJohn Belushi,River PhoenixandChris Farley, this dangerous polysubstance use has become aleading cause of overdose deathsacross the United States since the early- to mid-2010s.\n\nI am an assistant professor of public health who has written extensively onmethamphetamineandopioid useand thedangerous combination of the twoin the United States.\n\nAs these dangerous combinations of drugs increasingly flood the market, I see an urgent need and opportunity for a new approach to prevention and treatment.\n\nDating back to the 1970s, the term speedballing originally referred to the combination of heroin and cocaine. Combining stimulants and opioids – the former’s “rush” with the latter’s calming effect – creates a dangerous physiological conflict.\n\nAccording to theNational Institute on Drug Abuse, stimulant-involved overdose fatalities increased markedly from more than 12,000 annually in 2015 to greater than 57,000 in 2022, a 375% increase. Notably, approximately70% of stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2022also involved fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, reflecting the rising prevalence of polysubstance involvement in overdose mortality.\n\nUserssought to experience the euphoric “rush”from the stimulant and the calming effects of the opioid. However, with theproliferation of fentanyl– which is far more potent than heroin – this combination has become increasingly lethal. Fentanyl isoften mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine, sometimes without the user’s knowledge, leading tounintentional overdoses.\n\nThe rise in speedballing is part of a broader trend of polysubstance use in the U.S. Since 2010, overdoses involving both stimulants and fentanyl have increased50-fold, now accounting for approximately 35,000 deaths annually.\n\nThis has been called thefourth wave of the opioid epidemic. Thetoxic and contaminated drug supplyhas exacerbated this crisis.\n\nStimulants like cocaineincrease heart rate and blood pressure, whileopioids suppress respiratory function. This combination can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse and death. People who use both substances aremore than twice as likelyto experience a fatal overdose compared with those using opioids alone.\n\nThe conflicting effects of stimulants and opioids can also exacerbate mental health issues. Users may experience heightenedanxiety, depressionandparanoia. The combination can also impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion and poor decision-making.\n\nSpeedballing can also lead to severe cardiovascular problems, includinghypertension,heart attackandstroke. The strain on the heart and blood vessels from the stimulant, combined with the depressant effects of the opioid, increases the risk of these life-threatening conditions.\n\nIncreasing awareness about the dangers of speedballing is crucial. I believe thateducational campaignscan inform the public about the risks of combining stimulants and opioids and the potential for unintentional fentanyl exposure.\n\nThere is a great need for betteraccess to treatment for people with stimulant use disorder– acondition defined asthe continued use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine or other stimulants leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, from mild to severe. Treatments for this andother substance use disorders are underfundedand less accessible than those for opioid use disorder. Addressing this gap can help reduce the prevalence of speedballing.\n\nImplementing harm reduction strategies by public health officials, community organizations and health care providers, such as providingfentanyl test stripsandnaloxone– a medication that reverses opioid overdoses –can save lives.\n\nThese measures allow individuals to test their drugs for the presence of fentanyl and have immediate access to overdose-reversing medication. Implementing these strategies widely is crucial to reducing overdose deaths and improving community health outcomes.\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

    "News_text":"House Republicans toiled through the night and into the early hours of Thursday torescueDonald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” A final vote on the tax cut and Medicaid-slashing legislation is expected soon, potentially meeting Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had hoped for a smooth path after the Senate passed the sweeping bill earlier this week, but far-right holdouts and uneasy moderates threw the process into chaos Wednesday evening. A procedural vote on the legislation turned into a hours-long standoff and sent Johnson and Trump scrambling to avert a collapse.\n\nFive Republicans — Reps. Keith Self of Texas, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania —voted againstthe rule that would allow the House to proceed to final debate. Eight others initially withheld their votes altogether, leaving Johnson without the slim majority he needed.\n\nJohnson kept the vote open for nearly six hours as he worked the floor, telling Fox News that he would keep the voteopen“for as long as it takes.” By around 3:30 a.m., all but one GOP dissenter, Fitzpatrick, had flipped, and the rule passed 219–213. All Democrats voted against.\n\n“The Senate broke the House framework, and then they stomped all over it. Now, House leadership wants to cram this broken bill down our throats by rushing it to the floor while in the middle of discussions, completely disregarding their promises.” Selfexplainedon X earlier in the evening, defending his initial opposition. “Ultimately, this is an issue of morality. Abiding by our word is the only thing we have; therefore, as the bill currently stands, I voted against the rule.”\n\nBut by dawn, his resolve, and that of his colleagues,  had weakened.\n\nTrump himself weighed in on Truth Social throughout the night, alternating between threats and appeals. “What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!” hewroteshortly after midnight.\n\nTrump posted again a half an hour later, noting the wobbling of some Republicans.\n\nHoldouts said they extracted vague assurances from the White House about implementing the bill.

    "News_title":"Trump’s Assault on Separation of Powers Made Explicit in His Megabill Vote Whipping",
    "News_text":"A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo.Sign upfor the email version.\n\nInyesterday’s edition of Morning Memo, we unpacked the various ways in which House Republicans have, since President Trump arrived back at the White House, repeatedly demonstrated to him that they have no interest in using their authority to serve as a constitutional check on the executive branch.\n\nTrump has apparently made his power grab on the legislative branch even more explicit in his conversations with House Republicans in the last 24 hours.\n\nAs we’ve documented in ourcoverageof House Republican leadership’s ongoing (at the moment) effort to get their conference to rubber-stamp the Senate version of Trump’s megabill, Trump has once again become House Majority Whip. It’s a mantle he’s taken up many times in the 119th Congress, both to force Republicans to reelect Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) as speaker and to strong-arm members who are famously anti-continuing resolution to vote in favor of a continuing resolution.\n\nThe White House is employing the same tactic to get the Senate bill through the House this week. During his hours-long speech on the House floor this morning, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) warned the public about the dynamic: Trump is likely making backroom deals with holdouts to entice them to support legislation theyactuallyoppose.\n\n“Don’t you have some responsibility … to say to the American people what happened?” Jeffriessaid earlier today. “What deals were cut, what occurred in the back room? Yes. It will all come out. One way or the other.”\n\nDuring an interview withCNBCthis morning, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) alluded to an assurance he received from Trump — that the president would fix whatever issues individual Republicans had with the legislation via executive action.\n\n“We met with President Trump, and, you know, he did a masterful job of laying out how we could improve it, how he could use his chief executive office, use things to make the bill better,” Normansaid Thursday morning. “We accepted the bill as is. What’s different is President Trump is going to use his powers.”\n\nIt’s all of a piece with the constitutionally backwards approach Trump and his allies in Congress have taken to governing throughout his second term. At this point, they’re barely participating in the charade that lawmakers have authority that is separate but equal to Trump’s.\n\nAnd, so, things appear to be going as they have throughout Trump II on Capitol Hill. Following an afternoon and evening of handwringing by some House Republicans about the massive hole the Big, Beautiful Bill would blow in the national debt, and handwringing by others about how extreme the bill is, nearlyeveryone got in lineand voted to move it forward. Trump and White House budget director Russ Voughtreportedlyspent hours putting the screws to these holdouts, affirming this year’s dynamic: Trump, and the apparent fear he instills, is the one thing that can get the historically unruly GOP congressional conference in line.\n\nIn the end, only Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), who represents a district north of Philadelphia that often votes for Democrats, voted “no” on advancing the bill, joining with all Democratic members.\n\nThe Department of Justice is considering bringing charges against state or local election officials that it deems to have taken insufficient steps to protect their computer systems, the latest way in which Trump’s 2020 Big Lie — that he won — has animated his second administration.\n\nThe New York Times:\n\nThe department’s effort, which is still in its early stages, is not based on new evidence, data or legal authority, according to the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Instead, it is driven by the unsubstantiated argument made by many in the Trump administration that American elections are easy prey to voter fraud and foreign manipulation, these people said.\n\nShould the administration pursue this, it would suspend the threat of criminal charges over the heads of state and local election officials as they do their jobs.\n\nTrump official Paul Ingrassia — currently the administration’s nominee to head the Office of Special Counsel — has considerable baggage, including his attendance at a rally hosted by neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes and his work for the legal team of far-right influencer Andrew Tate, who faces allegations of rape and human trafficking in multiple countries.\n\nCNNuncovered a new item for the list: He shared a 9\/11 truther video.Last year.On September 11.\n\nTrump made it official this week,nominatinghis former lawyer and spokesperson Alina Habba to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey. Habba has been serving in that role in an acting capacity, during which time Democratic lawmakers in the state have been arrested, followed by a set of bizarre charging decisions. A federal magistrate judgecriticizedher office’s hasty arrest, and subsequent quick dismissal, of trespassing charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Habba is, meanwhile, pursuing assault charges against U.S. Rep LaMonica McIver (D-NJ).\n\nA new Idaholawbans the display of “political, religious, or ideological views, including but not limited to political parties, race, gender, sexual orientation, or political ideologies” in schools. This, immediately, is going as well as you might expect, with the state attorney general (and former member of Congress) Raúl Labradorfindingthat a teacher must take down a banner that reads “everyone is welcome here” above an image of hands with various skin tones.\n\n“These signs are part of an ideological\/social movement which started in Twin Cities, Minnesota following the 2016 election of Donald Trump,” a statement from Labrador’s office reads.\n\nThe American Prospect has areporton how DOGE’s massive disruption for federal government staffing has upset D.C.’s economy.\n\nTPM’s Layla A. Jones wrote on a similar topic last week,reporting:\n\nIn the DMV region, encompassing D.C., parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, more than 500,000 people work directly for the federal government, according to data from the 2023 American Community Survey and 2025 Current Employment Statistics compiled by the Economic Policy Institute this year. These numbers don’t account for the vast network of external government contractors reliant on federal dollars. Massive job and contract cuts stand to alter the socioeconomic geography of the Beltway in a way the New York Times compared to the devastating impact of the collapse of manufacturing on the Midwest.\n\nThe always greatJohn Ganz:\n\nIt’s long been my contention that the attack on citizenship is the most serious and frightful aspect of the Trump phenomenon and the one that makes it most deserving of the epithet fascist or totalitarian. “MAGA,” in its innermost being, means “death to America.” If they successfully destroy American citizenship as enshrined in the Constitution they will have destroyed the country. We will be, all of a sudden, somewhere else. It may be called the United States of America, but it really won’t be. It won’t feel like a big cataclysm, happening all at once. It will come not with a bang but a whimper. It will be a chaotic and shambolic existence where more and more people have to scramble to ensure they have the right papers or are in the right zone. It will be stupid and laughable, a “system” not particularly hard to outwit, but unspeakably dire in its consequences if one happens to through a crack. And likely, for most, they will have little to worry about. Superficially, life will continue much as before. But we will be a sad shadow of that former country, at times recognizable in its old outlines, but fading fast.\n\nMorning Memo will be back on Monday. Enjoy your hot dogs.\n\nDo you like Morning Memo?Let us know!",

    "News_title":"Opinion - Trump is making it easier than ever for criminals to get guns",
    "News_text":"Campaigning in 2024, Donald Trump made clear where he stood on gun policy whenhe pledgedto “terminate every single one of the Harris-Biden’s attacks on law-abiding gun owners his first week in office and stand up for our constitutionally enshrined right to bear arms.”\n\nWhat he didn’t say was that he would enact the most criminal-friendly gun policy of any presidential administration in U.S. history.\n\nAs expected, Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have movedto roll backBiden-era gun policies that took a tougher line on gun dealers who falsified records, on gun purchases that avoided required background checks, and that regulated “ghost guns” to require serial numbers on formerly untraceable guns or gun parts.\n\nCentral to Trump’s deregulation of gun access is his evisceration of the federal agency charged with administering the nation’s gun laws, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. For decades, gun rights proponents have pilloried the ATF, calling it “scandal-ridden,” an out of control “rogue agency” that has persistently abused its power, and that had amassed “atyrannical recordof misconduct and abuse.”\n\nTo be sure, the ATF has blundered, as when it tragically mishandled the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas in 1993, and when it botched a covert gun-running operation into Mexico, named “Fast and Furious,” in 2009. But these incidents, along with the relentless attacks directed against the agency, conceal a very different reality.\n\nWhen compared to other federal law enforcement agencies, the ATF consistently ranks as the smallest and most poorly funded. Its annual appropriations have grown more slowly than any other federal law enforcement agency. Charged with monitoring the more than 80,000 licensed U.S. gun dealers, the ATFbarely has the personnelto conduct routine dealer inspections once every 10 years, not to mention the ATF’s obligation toinspect the nation’s 9,000 explosives license holders.\n\nThe agency is even barred by law from computerizing its records. Background checks are still conducted by hand at a national tracing center in Martinsburg, W.V., where the sheer weight of its paper records nearly caused the building in which they are housed to collapse in 2019. Routine gun traces cantake two weeks.\n\nAnd far from being a rogue or out-of-control agency, a2021 investigationby The Trace found that the ATF’s dealer monitoring “has been largely toothless and conciliatory, bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers.” In fact, it found that gun dealers were “largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries.”\n\nNow the Trump administration is moving ahead tofire two-thirdsof the 800 ATF personnel charged with monitoring gun dealers’ compliance with federal law, to cut the agency’s $1.6 billion budget by a third, toweaken or eliminatemore than 50 existing rules and regulations and torefocus its resourceson immigration. While most gun dealers ply their trade honestly, some have been found toflout the lawconsistently. In 2023, the ATF reported 93 gun dealers thatwillfully violatedfederal law. The ongoing evisceration of the ATF’s monitoring abilities will have a predictable result of more dealers selling guns to those who shouldn’t have them.\n\nAfter all, why should someone bent on obtaining guns for illicit purposes bother with an unpredictable and dangerous black market, the risks of gun theft or other unreliable secondary sources when anyone can more or less put down money at a gun shop and walk off with firearms, no questions asked?\n\nAs for ghost guns, law enforcement agencies across the country have reported that they are increasingly being used in crimes. From 2017 to 2023, the number of ghost gunsfound at crime scenesskyrocketed from 1,629 to 27,490. With the end of efforts to serialize guns and parts, expect that number to keep rising, frustrating efforts to solve gun-related crimes. The abandonment of this initiative raises a question without an obvious answer: Why would any law-abiding citizen want a gun that cannot be traced?\n\nThe protection of gun rights has nothing to do with feeding gun-fueled criminality. From America’s very earliest days, governmental leadersenacted a wide array of lawsto keep guns away from those considered a threat to public safety, including extensive use ofgun licensing dating back centuries.\n\nThe Trump administration now seems bent on rejecting one of our country’s longest, oldest and most important legal and political traditions: protecting its citizens from criminality, violence and threats to public safety.\n\nRobert J.

    "News_title":"This was the best place on Earth to see great white sharks—then they vanished",
    "News_text":"Built like a torpedo with rows of terrifying 2.5-inch teeth, the world’s largest predatory shark is an intimidating sight. So intimidating that some might think an ocean withoutgreat white sharks(Carcharodon carcharias) would be a good thing. But their loss causes a ripple effect that transforms the entire ecosystem.\n\nA new study inFrontiers in Marine Scienceshows what happens when sharks vanish. Seal Island, off South Africa's False Bay was once a great white hotspot—one of the few places on Earth where the sharks could be seen surging out of the water to capture prey.\n\n“It was airJaws,” says marine ecologistNeil Hammerschlag, executive director of theShark Research Foundation Inc. and a coauthor on the new study. “I don't think there's anything more remarkable in nature than seeing a 2,000-pound great white flying out of the air with a seal in its mouth.”\n\nWhen the predatorsdisappeared, researchers and conservationists pointed fingers at both encroaching orcas and humans as the culprit. But Hammerschlag and his colleagues, who began studying the ecosystem around the island in 2000 long before the vanishing, saw some surprising changes.\n\nTwenty years ago, Seal Island was “the greatest place on earth to see great whites,” recallsHammerschlag, who also serves as president ofAtlantic Shark Expeditions. Around 2010, white shark numbers around False Bay started dropping off, and the decline got steeper from 2015 on. By 2018, the great whites were gone.\n\nExactly why the sharks vanished remains a mystery. “The departure of the white shark is really open to discussion,” saysGreg Skomal, a shark biologist with Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\nSome suggest the animals fled becausekiller whalesmoved in. Orcas cankill a shark in minutesby precisely carving out itsnutrient-rich liver.\n\nHammerschlag thinks humans could also be to blame, as nearby shark nets kill “somewhere between 25 and 30 great whites a year.”  Even a small loss can drive the population into decline, he says, because great whites become sexuallymaturelate in life—males in their20sand females in their 30s—and have small litters of up to 12pups.\n\n(A baby great white shark led scientists to a huge nursery near NYC.)\n\nSharks are thought to keep marine habitats healthy by removing weak and sick animals from the food chain and keeping things in balance. But proving these impacts in a real-world habitat this is challenging.\n\n“These kinds of ecosystem effects are very difficult for us to tease out because they require long-term data sets,” says Skomal.\n\nIn False Bay, Hammerschlag’s and his colleagues partnered with an ecotourism company, allowing them to spend “full days on the water, 200 days a year.” The team collected over 20 years of data, from before, during and after the great whites’ disappearance.\n\n“We saw things happen that we’d never expect,” Hammerschlag says.\n\nBroadnose sevengill sharks (Notorynchus cepedianus) suddenly appeared—sometimes as many as 15 in one day. These animals usually hang out several kilometers away in kelp beds, which offer protection from great white attacks. “From nothing to double digits. It’s just mind blowing,” he says.\n\nThe Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) population also increased. Safe from the threat of sharks, seals were rafting—floating in groups, like a living raft—and going after the cage divers’ bait. “That would have been suicide just a few years earlier,” he says.\n\nBoth seals and sevengills were on the menu for great whites, so it made sense to see their numbers rise. But Hammerschlag and his colleagues also wanted to find out if the populations of animals that seals and sevengills eat had changed, too.\n\nLuckily, scientist Lauren De Vos had installed cameras in 2012 to get a snapshot of fish populations at the time for another study. Hammerschlag’s team followed the same method—even down to borrowing the same equipment. As expected, the new data showed a decline in seal prey like anchovies and Cape horse mackerel and sevengill prey, such as smoothhound sharks and pyjama catsharks.\n\nThis zigzag of impacts—white sharks vanish, their prey increases and, in turn, the animals they eat declines—suggests this isn’t caused by problems like pollution or development.\n\n“If habitat destruction was occurring, you would think everything would go down,” rather than some species declining and some increasing, Hammerschlag says. But the study numbers don’t reflect that.\n\nThe small area of False Bay, with relatively few species, made figuring out some of these food chain impacts easier.  “Hammerschlag has that connectivity mapped out because he knows what eats what,” says Skomal. The more species in an ecosystem, the more difficult it is to map the food chain and track the impacts when an animal is lost. Establishing the relationships between animals in a broader area, like the Gulf of Maine, which has hundreds of species, would be much harder, he says.\n\n(Cape Cod may have the highest density of great white sharks in the world.)\n\nScientists in South Africa have noticed great white shark population changes in other ecosystems, too, and researchers believe the factors driving these changes are similar to the ones cited in False Bay. Shark behavioral ecologistLacey Williamshas seen “pretty significant changes” in Mossel Bay and Plettenberg Bay, or ‘Plett.’\n\nIn Plett, shark appearances used to be “random,” she says. Then around 2022, locals started noticing the sharks “in a very predictable spot” around Robberg Peninsula. Before long, the sharks started arriving later in the season and then sightings dwindled.\n\nIn Mossel Bay, great white sightings stayed relative steady until around 2021 but have declined since then. In May 2022, drone footage emerged of two orcas killing a white shark. “That was really the beginning of the significant changes of white sharks in Mossel Bay,” she says. Last year, the cage diving company that Williams works with saw “less than one handful” of sightings between April and December, she says.\n\nSouth Africa’s white shark population had already been declining “prior to the arrival of these two very famous, sexy scapegoats,” Williams says. “The orcas are like pouring kerosene on an already burning bonfire.”\n\nHuman have driven the broader declines too, she says. Long line fisheries have targeted demersal sharks—that live just above the seabed, like critically endangeredsoupfin sharks(Galeorhinus galeus) and smooth-hound sharks—for decades. These species are a key food source for white sharks so removing them has a ripple effect.\n\nAs in False Bay, shark nets are another concern. Many people mistakenly believe that these form a barrier to protect swimmers from sharks. “It doesn't really protect people from anything,” says Williams. “The only thing it really does is kill wildlife indiscriminately.”\n\nAlthough there’s no silver bullet, potential solutions includeShark Spotters,drones, andSharkSafe BarrierTMtechnology. This magnetic device, which imitates kelp forests, seems to deter white sharks. These systems are expensive, but the investment is worth it, says Williams. “If we don't have an ecosystem, we're going to lose tourism.”\n\nIt currently seems too early to tell how the decline in white sharks in Mossel Bay and Plettenberg might impact the wider ecosystem. “It's worth looking into, though,” Williams says. “I think it's safe to say we'll see changes.”\n\nBack in False Bay, one possible outcome of all of these shifts is that seals and sevengills might run out of animals to eat. Could the ecosystem collapse? It’s too early to know. “That would be the next question,” says Skomal. “Is it too many seals?”\n\nToday, great whites’ incredible aerial displays are a thing of the past at Seal Island. “You'd never know this was a great white hotspot,” Hammerschlag says.\n\nFor him, seeing how the whole ecosystem has changed shows the importance of enforcing shark protections and using non-lethal methods to protect beachgoers from shark bites.\n\n“We can't change the orcas’ behavior,” he says, “But we can stop the netting program. That's kind of archaic.”",

    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nThe so-called moderate Republicanspromisedthey would not slash Medicaid. Conservatives vowed not to explode the national debt. Party leaders insisted that they would not lump a jumble of unrelated policies into a single enormous piece of legislation andrushthat bill through Congress before any reasonable person had time to read it.\n\nBut President Donald Trump wanted his “big, beautiful bill” enacted in time to sign it with a celebratory flourish on America’s birthday. And so nearly all GOP lawmakers in the House and Senate, setting aside these and many other pledges, principles, and policy demands, did what the president desired.\n\nThe legislation that cleared the Senate and House this week is many things, and it does fulfill some core promises that Trump made as a candidate: The measure makes permanent his first-term tax cuts (and reduces some taxes even further), injects billions in new spending for immigration enforcement and national defense, and rolls back some of the incentives for clean energy enacted by the predecessor whom Trump loathes, Joe Biden.\n\nUltimately, however, its passage through narrow Republican majorities is the most consequential demonstration yet of how tightly Trump controls his party. To fulfill the president’s wishes and meet his arbitrary deadline, some Republicans reneged on pledges to oppose deep social-safety-net cuts, while others abandoned efforts to preserve tax credits that benefited their states and districts. Spending hawks who vowed to uphold some semblance of fiscal responsibility caved rather than stand firm for deeper cuts.\n\n[Annie Lowrey: A big, bad, very ugly bill]\n\nDemocrats made all of these arguments many times over, to little avail. But so did one surprising Republican, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who opposed the bill and then immediately announced his retirement rather than face the electoral ramifications of infuriating Trump. Tillis has developed a reputation as a bipartisan dealmaker during his decade in the Senate. But he is not usually a renegade. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska vote more frequently with Democrats than he does. Others in the party had drawn brighter red lines during the debate over Trump’s bill. Once Tillis abandoned his bid for a third term, however, he became the GOP’s truth-teller. “I think the people in the White House—the amateurs advising the president—are not telling him that the effect of this bill is to break a promise,” Tillis said on the Senate floor, referring to the legislation’s health-care cuts.\n\nTwo of his colleagues, Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, took a different path. For months, Hawley had waged a campaign against cutting Medicaid,arguingas recently as May that doing so would be “morally wrong and politically suicidal.” Bit by bit, he softened his stance. He first acquiesced to an initial version of the bill that instituted work requirements for Medicaid, and then he accepted even deeper cuts in the Senate’s version. By the time the bill came to the floor, Hawley had given up entirely. Rather than block the bill, he vowed to try to stop the changes he voted for from being implemented over the coming years.\n\nJohnson railed against the bill from the opposite direction, criticizing the rush to pass it and insisting on far deeper spending cuts rather than adding trillions to the debt. He held out a little longer than Hawley. Johnson initially voted to block the bill, relenting on Saturday night only after he and a few other conservatives had secured the GOP leadership’s support for an amendment that could effectively end the expansion of Medicaid under Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. But the proposal encountered swift resistance, and by the time of the final Senate vote on the megabill Tuesday, the conservatives had withdrawn the amendment. Johnson, like Hawley, hadfallen in line.\n\nPolls show that the Trump bill is deeply unpopular, but for most in the GOP, the public’s view has not been an overriding concern. Over the past two decades, both parties have become accustomed to thin congressional majorities and fleeting windows of opportunity to enact their agendas. When I spoke with Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee,earlier this year, he summarized the party’s attitude: “We could get nothing done, in which case I guarantee you, we’ll be punished” by the voters, Cole told me. But with just a three-seat House majority, he noted, Republicans might be damned either way. “History would tell you we would normally lose the majority in the midterms anyway,” Cole said. “So when you got it, you ought to use it.”\n\n[Read: Even Tom Cole is defending DOGE]\n\nThe collapse of GOP opposition to the Trump bill in the Senate repeated itself in the House. There, too, Republicans from both ends of the party mounted seemingly firm stands against the proposal—when the House first considered the bill in May and then again after the Senate passed its version this week—only to fold under pressure from the president and GOP leaders. In a series of votes throughout the night, dissenters turned to supporters without winning any changes to the bill. The trend was foreseeable, if not inevitable. Nearly universally, Republicans backed the underlying tenets of the bill—preventing an across-the-board tax hike while funding Trump’s immigration crackdown—and they agreed on the urgency of passing it this summer. Even the measure’s few consistent critics, such as Senator Rand Paul and Representative Thomas Massie, both of Kentucky, wanted to extend the tax cuts.\n\nSo did Murkowski, the Alaska moderate. In 2017, she joined Collins and a defiant Senator John McCain of Arizona to thwart Trump’s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Murkowski has continued to oppose Trump occasionally during the early months of his second term. But she has acknowledged that the threat of retaliation from the president weighs on her and her colleagues. “We are all afraid,” Murkowskisaid in April. This time around, she negotiated carve-outs for Alaska from some of the worst effects of the Trump bill, drawing unfavorable comparisons to the backroom deals Democrats struck to win votes for the ACA.\n\n“Do I like this bill?

    "News_title":"Catching up with the Canine Companion helping an American veteran",
    "News_text":"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — As we celebrate Independence Day, we often think about those who fight for our freedom.\n\nBack in 2023, we metone man who did just that, but it wasn’t without paying a price. His name is Rob Garlick, a veteran who suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. NBC4 first spoke with him as he began to form a bond with his Canine Companions service dog, Fritter.\n\nIn 2025, the bond of this veterans team has grown and now Garlick hopes his journey can help others. “I was raised boys don’t cry and you know then you join the military and they reinforce that fact,” said Garlick.\n\nTwo weeks after leaving high school, Garlick went to basic training and joined the army, serving from 2003 to 2008. When he left the service, a new battle was just beginning. More than a decade later he would reach a breaking point. “Late 2021, I had a kind of a mental collapse from stress of a job and PTSD,” he said.\n\nSnuggly, playful pup is looking for her forever home\n\nThat’s when he asked for help, which led him to Canine Companions and the dog he said changed his life. “He’s really allowed my son and I to go out and enjoy time together which really didn’t happen in the past before I had fritter.”\n\nFritter was trained to specifically interrupt Garlick’s anxiety, hypervigilance and nightmares. That anxiety can often look like a clenched fist or the tapping of his foot.\n\n“So, they took that information and they started training fritter to watch my feet, to watch my hands,” said Garlick. “Then overtime as we bonded, he picked up on the cues without those who specific things happening.”\n\nFritter also helps Garlick navigate stressful environments. “I use Fritter as a barrier to me and other people so when we’re walking through a crowd, he’ll walk in front of me, and he plows a hole through people for me,” he said. “If we’re standing in line, they did train him to do what’s called behind so he’ll sit directly behind me and that keeps people from getting right behind me.”\n\nGarlick said his bond with Fritter has grown tremendously over the past two years. He also wants to tell other veterans to not wait to get the help they need.\n\n“Don’t do the downward spiral for 15 years like I did. It is not fair to you or your family,” said Garlick. “I mean I know it’s hard to ask for help. It was probably the hardest think I ever did was break down and ask for help, but in the long run it’s better.”\n\nGarlick is now very involved with Canine Companions. He serves on the outreach committee and continues to advocate for other veterans.\n\nIf you are a veteran and think a service dog may help you — whether that be with PTSD or any disabilities — you canfill out an application on Canine Companions website.

    "News_title":"How Angela Rayner became the power behind the throne",
    "News_text":"It was the picture at PMQs that told a thousand words about two women’s changing fortunes.While Rachel Reeves wept on Wednesday, Angela Rayner sat beside her, stony faced and resolute. As gilt yields shuddered in the City, the political stock of the Deputy Prime Minister was rising, just as the Chancellor’s was falling. In fact,after Sir Keir Starmer’s climbdown over welfare reform, in the face of a bruising public battle between ministers and Labour backbenchers, Rayner emerges as the only frontbencher with her stature significantly enhanced.\n\nShe has, it seems, played her role to perfection throughout this crisis. In public, she has been the model example of loyalty, dutifully repeating No 10’s lines at the despatch box, whatever her private reservations about the scale of welfare cuts signed off by Starmer and Reeves.\n\nYet after Starmer narrowly avoided a defeat on the Welfare Bill on Tuesday night, by significantly watering down his plans, reports credited her with helping to broker key last-minute compromises with MPs. In the eyes of MPs on the Left of the party, who see Rayner as something of a tribune, she has helped to temper a policy they hated. To colleagues in Government, she has helped also win the day – avoiding an embarrassing defeat on the floor of the Commons.\n\n“Angela’s had a good war,” reflected one MP in the parliamentary bar, after the vote. Such sentiments are quietly being echoed across the party, as Labour ruefully reflects on its first year in office.\n\nThe steady increase in Rayner’s power is an underappreciated story of the last 12 months. Upon entering government, her power base appeared to have been curtailed by Starmer, following a series of skirmishes between the pair in Opposition. Rayner was denied the status she craved: her own department, an “Office of Deputy Prime Minister”, giving her parity with John Prescott under Tony Blair. In the absence of that, allies talked up the extent of her responsibilities in government, having also been put in charge of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, and given special responsibility for employment rights.\n\nHowever, Dorneywood, Prescott’s old grace-and-favour countryside abode in Buckinghamshire, which is traditionally available to the second most senior member of government,was handed to Reeves, not Rayner(“Rachel wanted Dorneywood, I’m happy for Rachel to be using it,” said Rayner last year). Initially, she was not listed as a permanent member of the National Security Council, despite previous deputy prime ministers being included as standing members.\n\nAll that seems very different now. In the coming weeks, she will get her official Office of Deputy Prime Minister, with 30 staff, a new logo and email domain. It will cement Rayner’s status at the heart of power, and sharpen her elbow when it comes to coordinating her policy agenda across Whitehall.\n\nAs Starmer struggles with plummeting public opinion ratings and increasingly rebellious colleagues, Rayner is increasingly seen by colleagues as the woman who is making much of the running in this administration. While Starmer himself is regarded as insufficiently bold, the reforms for which Rayner is directly responsible, which include relaxing green belt rules and strengthening trade union powers, are giving succour to Labour backbenchers desperate for radical change. “Planning and trade unions are two things to cheer about,” says one welfare rebel. “Angela is key to both.”\n\nPlanning reform has become one of the great hopes of this Government.Rayner’s target of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029is viewed by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) as one of the few Labour measures that is likely to boost growth. Cheered on by the 100-strong Labour Growth Group, Rayner has become the face of supply-side social democrats in the cabinet. Her promise to build 180,000 social houses wins her kudos on the Left of the party, too.\n\nThen there are her municipal reforms. In December, she announced a “devolution revolution” – the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.It involved cancelling a swathe of elections across the country, prompting howls of protest from Reform. But the plan bore the hallmarks of a fiercely political minister, stamping her authority on a long-divisive subject. She is showing a similar determination in her plans to radically rebalance council tax to prioritise deprived areas – a move that is likely to see tax bills rising in the South to fund investment in the North. “She has the guts to do what Boris Johnson never could,” argues one Labour source. “Actually do proper levelling-up.”\n\nKey to Rayner’s growing power within Labour is her brief on employment rights. She is championing the biggest restoration of trade union rights in decades, piloting Labour’s flagship legislation through parliament. For her own MPs, who have grown increasingly muted during Starmer’s performances at PMQs, it gives them something to cheer about. “Socialism is what a Labour government does,” declared Herbert Morrison. Increasingly, for frustrated Labour backbenchers, Rayner is one of the few ministers who seems to grasp this.\n\nSuch an expansive portfolio gives Rayner plenty of face time with her 400 parliamentary colleagues. Unlike the Prime Minister, who has entered the Commons voting lobbies on just a handful of occasions since the election, Rayner is praised by colleagues as “accessible” and “reasonable”. In both age, tastes and background, the 45-year-old Rayner is seen by some younger MPs as a much warmer figure than the somewhat stiff Starmer. A self-described “vape dragon”, karaoke fiend and lover of Venom cocktails (vodka, Southern Comfort, Blue WKD and orange juice, for the uninitiated), she is well-liked across the party. Even Nigel Farage, who has little time for much of the current cabinet, has praised her authenticity: “At least she is real – none of the rest are.”\n\nRayner’s rise has coincided with the collapse of rivals within the party. Reeves is now, according to Ipsos, the most unpopular politician in the country. Yvette Cooper faces an impossible summer at the Home Office, dealing with an endless stream of small boats across the Channel. Bridget Phillipson, the Education Secretary, and a one-time possible rival from the soft Left, has been besieged by criticism over her changes to academies. Wes Streeting, the Blair-loving Health Secretary, is one of the few to have been enhanced, rather than diminished, by his time in office – not least thanks to his bold start on NHS reform.\n\nMany of Starmer’s allies would hope that it is Streeting, not Rayner, who eventually succeeds him. Yet Rayner’s union connections and standing among party members would likely give her the edge in any future contest. “It’s a while off – but it will be Angela,” says one minister, confidently.\n\nFor now, her allies can take comfort in the fact that it is Rayner’s agenda that is driving so much of the current administration. While Reeves and Starmer struggle in Downing Street, Rayner is the one who gives her MPs something to cheer. Her moment could well come next May, when Labour is likely to lose the Welsh parliament elections for the first time since devolution in 1999, as well as suffer heavy losses in Scotland and the London boroughs. Labour MPs – rarely the most regicidal types – could get jolted into action. Should they do so then the red queen, for so-long overlooked, is ready to inherit the throne.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Pa. officials warn Medicaid cuts will have ‘devastating effects’",
    "News_text":"Pennsylvania officials and hospital groups warn that there could be dire consequences for Medicaid recipients when the tax and spending bill proposed by President Donald Trump becomes law.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act promoted by Trump was narrowly passed by the House on Thursday, which forwarded it to Trump for signing.\n\nThe bill would cut safety-net programs including Medicaid and SNAP, lower federal taxes for some, put more money into border security agencies and the Pentagon, and add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers and Trump administration officials have denied that the controversial bill slashes Medicaid, but the budget office, Democratic leaders and hospital groups say that Medicaid would in fact be cut for some of the 70 million low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program, resulting in more people seeking care in the emergency room and hurting rural hospitals.\n\nLooking at the numbers\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro’s office said that the proposed changes to Medicaid could strip health coverage from more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians, drive up health care costs, and put rural hospitals out of business. Nearly 144,000 Pennsylvanians who receive SNAP could also lose their access to critical food assistance, he said.\n\nThis week, Shapiro, officials from his administration and rural health leaders spoke at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Wayne County to talk about what they called the “devastating effects” the proposed cuts would have on rural Pennsylvanians and health care providers.\n\nShapiro’s office said that so-called state-directed payments would be necessary to bring average Medicaid reimbursement for Pennsylvania hospitals to 82 cents on the dollar. Without them, that average drops to 53 cents on the dollar.\n\nStatewide, the Senate’s state-directed payment provisions alone translate to a roughly $4.5 billion cut to Pennsylvania hospital payments over the next decade, Shapiro said.\n\nShapiro’s office broke down the estimated cuts by Pennsylvania congressional district. If the bill passes, in Rep. Dan Meuser’s 9th District there would be 17,967 who lose Medicaid coverage and 8,185 who lose SNAP benefits. In Rep. Ryan Mackenzie’s 7th District, 17,519 would lose Medicaid coverage and 6,096 would lose SNAP benefits. And in Rep. Rob Bresnahan’s 8th District, 21,637 would lose Medicaid coverage and 11,572 would lose SNAP benefits.\n\nMeuser, Bresnahan and Mackenzie, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill.\n\nIn addition to losses of health care access and coverage, the legislation would cost Pennsylvania an estimated 526,000 jobs and $71 billion in lost economic impact over the next decade, Shapiro said. He based that on the American Hospital Association’s analysis of state-by-state economic impacts using estimates of state allocation of cuts in the House-passed bill and estimates of additional losses from the Senate provisions.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro, shown at Sterman Masser Potato Farm, Sacramento, in May, joined rural health leaders this week at a hospital in Wayne County to talk about what they called the devastating effects the proposed Medicaid cuts would have on rural Pennsylvanians and health care providers. (MATTHEW PERSCHALL\/MULTIMEDIA EDITOR)\n\nPA Lawmakers react\n\nAfter the bill’s House passage, Meuser said in a statement that the legislation strengthens Medicaid.\n\n“It includes common-sense work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, removes individuals who are ineligible under the law from the rolls, and, beginning in October 2026, it ends the federal cost-share for states that choose to include illegal immigrants in their Medicaid programs — taking serious steps to address waste, fraud and abuse in the program,” he said.\n\n“It also delivers support for rural healthcare, creating a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care. We’re making Medicaid more sustainable, more accountable, and more focused on delivering real results for seniors, the disabled, and low-income families.”\n\nBresnahan said the bill will ensure continued Medicaid coverage by eliminating corruption.\n\n“We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste and abuse that are driving the program toward collapse,” he said. “This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so.”\n\nAlisha Hoffman-Mirilovich, executive director of Action Together NEPA, a political advocacy organization, condemned the bill and the members of the House and Senate who voted to pass it, specifically Bresnahan.\n\n“We are especially disappointed in freshman Congressman Rob Bresnahan,” Hoffman-Mirilovich said. “Rep. Bresnahan repeatedly promised to vote against any bill that guts benefits for the people in his district. And yet, he voted to do just that every single time it was up for a vote. His ‘yes’ vote on the bill’s final passage this morning is the last straw — he can no longer claim that he cares about his constituents losing care.”\n\nOutcry from healthcare professionals\n\nHospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania President and CEO Nicole Stallings spoke earlier in the week about the bill, warning that the Medicaid cuts included in the budget reconciliation bill would cause people to lose health care coverage and destabilize Pennsylvania hospitals and communities.\n\n“This legislation puts health care access, jobs, and economic competitiveness in jeopardy, especially in our rural communities,” she said in a statement.\n\n“More than half of the commonwealth’s acute care hospitals are operating in the red because payments already do not reflect the actual cost of providing care. They cannot absorb a cut of this magnitude, and some will have no choice but to reduce services or close.”\n\nThis week, M. Michael Peckman, director of communications and community engagement for Lehigh Valley Hospital–Schuylkill, said that his health system was “closely monitoring the legislation and the impact the proposed cuts could have on the communities we serve. We will continue to provide the best possible care to patients, regardless of their ability to pay.”\n\nSt. Luke’s University Health Network referred questions to HAP, while Geisinger Health System declined comment.\n\nDuring Shapiro’s event at Wayne Memorial Hospital, Dr. Debra Bogen, the state Secretary of Health, also said the proposed changes to the Medicaid program would have grave consequences for health care across Pennsylvania, from hospitals to individuals in both urban and rural communities.\n\n“When people do not have health insurance, they are forced to forego preventive care and rely on emergency care,” she said. “This, in turn, leads not only to worse health outcomes, but also increases uncompensated health care services, increases insurance premiums, and increases health care costs for all Pennsylvanians — on top of contributing to overcrowded emergency rooms.”\n\n“All of us know someone — whether it’s ourselves, a friend, loved one, or a neighbor — who Medicaid has helped. But no matter how you personally get your health care coverage, Medicaid is vital to protecting the health of your community,” said Department of Human Services Special Adviser Sara Goulet.\n\n‘Shredding of social safety net’\n\nThe impact of the current federal proposal would not end with Medicaid cuts, Shapiro’s office said. The bill does not extend enhanced premium tax credits available to Pennsylvanians who purchase health insurance through Pennie, Pennsylvania’s official health insurance marketplace, officials said.\n\nThese tax credits have made coverage more affordable than ever, and if they expire on schedule at the end of this year, it will also risk health insurance for an additional 270,000 Pennsylvanians, adding to the risk to hospitals and an increase in rates of uninsured and\/or uncompensated care, officials said.\n\n“The enhanced premium tax credits help individuals — including Pennsylvanian farmers, small business owners and families — afford quality insurance coverage and help our rural hospitals keep their doors open with the steady reimbursement for care that they need,” said Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys. “Congress’ proposed cuts to Medicaid and failure to renew these vital tax credits put Pennsylvanians at risk of losing critical access, putting lives and livelihoods in jeopardy.”\n\nAmong the groups criticizing the bill’s passage Thursday was the Pennsylvania Policy Center, with the center’s executive director Marc Stier calling the legislation “morally and economically bankrupt.”\n\n“There is the shredding of the social safety net — deep cuts to Medicaid, the ACA, and SNAP — that will bring physical pain, economic distress, and thousands of premature deaths to the people of Pennsylvania and the United States,” he said.\n\nHe also said the bill was damaging to work to address climate change, shifted more income and wealth to the ultra-rich and wealthy corporations through tax breaks, increased the deficit and made deep cuts in federal support for schools.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Party Chair Sharif Street was also critical of the bill.\n\n“House Republicans just showed the American people exactly who they work for and it’s not working families,” he said.\n\n“By passing this Big Ugly Bill, they’ve made their priorities painfully clear: tax breaks for billionaires, cuts to essential services and a relentless assault on the progress we’ve made. This bill is a raw deal for Pennsylvania.”",

    "News_title":"Brian Fitzpatrick is only Pa. Republican to oppose Trump’s budget bill",
    "News_text":"U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican whose district includes all of Bucks County and part of Montgomery County, talks to reporters in 2023. (Jennifer Shutt\/ States Newsroom)\n\nAfter weeks of debate, Republicans in Congress managed to pass a massive spending bill containing many of President Donald Trump’s domestic policy priorities.\n\nBroadly, the bill includes a slew of tax cuts and increases to defense and immigration enforcement spending, which is partially paid for with cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance. Still, the bill isprojectedto add more than $3 trillion to the country’s debt during the next decade.\n\nDebate over the bill threatened to split the Republican caucus, with deficit-wary hardliners decrying its price tag and others warning of the impacts of cutting social services like Medicaid and food assistance. Ultimately, the final version of the bill passed mostly along party lines, with three Republican senators and two Republican House members joining every Democrat in opposing the final legislation.\n\nThe only Pennsylvania Republican to oppose the bill was Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-01), a moderate representing the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nFitzpatrick voted in favor of an earlier version of the bill that passed the House, but opposed the amended version that returned from the Senate. It included even steeper cuts to Medicaid than had already been proposed.\n\n“I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle-class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief and for historic investments in our border security and our military,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement after the Thursday afternoon vote. “However, it was the Senate’s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community.”\n\nThe bill’s Republican defenders see it differently.\n\n“This bill delivers on the promise I made to the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania by providing the largest working-class tax cuts in American history, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime and securing the southern border,” said Rob Bresnahan (R-08), who represents Northeast Pennsylvania. “We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste and abuse that is driving the program toward collapse. This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities, and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so.”\n\nAccording to ananalysisof census data by KFF, a nonprofit focused on health policy research, 92% of Medicaid recipients under 65 are either working, attending school, or not working due to caregiving, illness or disability.\n\nNearly 12 million Americans could lose health insurance when the bill’s provisions take full effect, according toestimatesfrom the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Human Services estimated a previous version of the bill could have resulted in 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage, and another 270,000 losing access to government-backed Affordable Care Act plans because of the expiration of enhanced premium tax credits. The version of the bill that passed Thursday made even steeper cuts.\n\nPrimarily, Medicaid cuts are accomplished by implementing strict work requirements and reporting mandates. Medicaid recipients will have to prove they’re working or volunteering at least 80 hours a month if they are not children, elderly, disabled, seriously ill, in recovery or caretakers of children under 14. They will also have to certify their eligibility at least twice a year or risk losing benefits.\n\nPrevious efforts to implement similar work requirements in Georgia and Arkansas resulted intens of thousands of peoplewho should have qualified for the program becoming uninsured.\n\nThe bill also sets new limits on how much states can tax health care providers like hospitals to help pay for their Medicaid programs, reducing the top rate from 6% to 3.5% by 2032.\n\nThe Department of Human Services says the move could cost them $2.7 billion in tax revenue and federal matching funds when the change takes full effect.\n\nThe bill also cuts the federal share of SNAP funding in some cases, shifting some of the burden of paying for the food assistance program to states for the first time. Alaska and Hawaii aside, states with error rates above 6% — meaning the frequency that they underpay or overpay recipients — will have to fund between 5% and 15% of the program themselves.\n\nPennsylvania’serror ratewas 10.76% in 2024, slightly below the national rate of 10.93%\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro has said repeatedly in recent weeks that Pennsylvania does not have the money to make up for lost federal funds for safety net programs.\n\n“Shame on these members of Congress  who spent the last few months saying, ‘Oh, I’ll never cut Medicaid,’” Shapiro told WILK radio Thursday morning. “This is just crazy that they’re voting to knock poor people off of this assistance. Why? Because they wanted to give a huge tax cut to people at the highest income level.”\n\nThe cuts led to concerns about the financial impact on rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid dollars to stay afloat. To offset that, the Senate inserted a provision creating a $50 billion fund for them.\n\nThe biggest expenses in the bill are tax cuts. It extends the first Trump administration’s 2017 tax cuts that were set to expire; it makes good on Trump’s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay; it extends the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200; and it raises the SALT tax deduction cap, which allows people to deduct a portion of local taxes paid from their federal filings, from $10,000 to $40,000.\n\nThere are also new tax cuts for businesses that will allow them to write off additional expenses. However, many tax cuts for green energy projects passed under the Biden administration will be eliminated.\n\nThe bill includes $350 billion in new spending for national security and immigration enforcement, including $46 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, $45 billion for migrant detention facilities and $30 billion for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAnother $25 billion will go towards developing a country-wide missile defense system Trump has referred to as the “Golden Dome,” named after Israel’s “Iron Dome” that was built with U.S. assistance.\n\nThe CBOestimatedthe version of the bill that passed the House primarily benefited the wealthiest Americans, while costing the poorest.\n\nFactoring in cuts to safety net programs, the poorest 10% of households are expected to lose around $1,600 per year, while middle income households will gain between $500 and $1,000 and households in the top 10% of income levels will gain about $12,000 annually.\n\nDespite his ultimate opposition, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already hammered Fitzpatrick for voting on the initial version of the bill. Then, it passed the House on a 215-214 vote, where a single flip could have held it up.\n\n“Now, Fitzpatrick is trying to cover his tracks because he knows that his vote to advance massive cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax cuts for billionaires will end his career, ” Eli Cousin, a DCCC spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nWhile Fitzpatrick has held onto his seat since 2018, his districtvoted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harrisin the 2024 election.",

    "News_text":"BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government is signaling enough is enough when it comes to the fierce competition in the country'selectric car market.\n\nChina's industrial policy has engineereda remarkable transformationto electric vehicles in what is the world's largest auto market. In so doing, it has spawned far more makers than can possibly survive. Now, long-simmering concerns about oversupply and debilitating price wars are coming to the fore, even as the headline sales numbers soar to new heights.\n\nMarket-leaderBYDannounced this week that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars. Nearly half of those were pure electric vehicles and the rest were plug-in hybrids, it said in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange filing. The company phased out internal combustion engine cars in 2022.\n\nBYD came under thinly veiled criticism in late May when it launched a new round of price cuts, and several competitors followed suit. The chairman of Great Wall Motors warned the industry could come under threat if it continues on the same trajectory.\n\n“When volumes get bigger, it’s just much harder to manage and you become the bullseye,” said Lei Xing, an independent analyst who follows the industry.\n\nThe government is trying to rein in what is called “involution” — a term initially applied to the rat race for young people in China and now to companies and industries engaged in meaningless competition that leads nowhere.\n\nBYD has come under criticism for usingits dominant positionin ways that some consider unfair, sparking price wars that have caused losses across the industry, said Murthy Grandhi, an India-based financial risk analyst at GlobalData.\n\nWith the price war in its fourth year, Chinese automakers arelooking abroadfor profits. BYD's overseas sales more than doubled to 464,000 units in the first half of this year. Worried governments in the U.S. and EU haveimposed tariffson made-in-China electric vehicles, saying that subsidies have given them an unfair advantage.\n\nMarket leader BYD comes under attack\n\nThe latest bout of handwringing started when BYD cut the price of more than 20 models on May 23.\n\nThe same day, the chairman of Great Wall Motors, Wei Jianjun, said he was pessimistic about what he called the \"healthy development” of the EV market. He drew a comparison toEvergrande, the Chinese real estate giant whose collapse sent the entire industry into a downturn from which it has yet to recover.\n\n\"The Evergrande in the automobile industry already exists, but it is just yet to explode,” he said in a video message posted on social media.\n\nTwo days later, a BYD executive rejected any comparison to Evergrande and posted data-filled charts to buttress his case.\n\n“To be honest, I am confused and angry and it’s ridiculous!” Li Yunfei, BYD's general manager of brand and public relations, wrote on social media. “All these come from the shocking remarks made by Chairman Wei of Great Wall Motors.”\n\nNext, the government and an industry association weighed in. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers called for fair competition and healthy development of the industry, noting that major price cuts by one automaker had triggered a new price war panic.\n\nOn the same day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to tackle involution-style competition in the auto industry, saying that recent disorderly price wars posed a treat to the healthy and sustainable development of the sector.\n\n“That price cut might have been the final straw that irked both competitors and regulators for the ruthlessness that BYD continues to show,” Lei said.\n\nA promise to pay suppliers within 60 days signals possible shift\n\nThe following month, 17 automakers including BYD made a pledge: They would pay their suppliers within 60 days.\n\nOne way China's automakers have been surviving the bruising price wars is by delaying the payments for months. The agreement, if adhered to, would reduce financial pressure on suppliers and could rein in some of the fierce competition.\n\n“The introduction of the 60-day payment pledge is the call of the government to oppose involution-style competition,\" said Cui Dongshu, the secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association.\n\nIt also reduces the risk of an Evergrande-like scenario.\n\nMany automakers had stretched out payments by paying suppliers with short-term debt — promises to repay them in a certain period of time — instead of cash. Real estate developers used the same system. It worked until it didn't. When Evergrande defaulted on its debts, suppliers were left holding worthless promises to pay.\n\n“This practice is seen as a potential cause of a larger crisis, similar to what happened with Evergrande,” Grandhi said.\n\nThe vows to speed up payments and the government calls to rein in the price wars, along with a rollback of some financing offers, point to an effort to reverse downward price expectations, said Jing Yang, a director at Fitch Ratings who focuses on the auto industry.\n\n“We may watch how effectively these measures are in reversing the price trend and how would that affect EV demand in the coming quarters,” she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.",

    "News_text":"Wednesday’sdrama in the Sean “Diddy” Combs caseextended to the courthouse hallway as well — where members of the embattled rap mogul’s legal team rushed to help a man having a seizure.\n\nImmediately after Combs’failed bid to get released on bailWednesday afternoon, the jailed hip-hop tycoon’s lead lawyer Marc Agnifilo left the 26th-floor courtroom in Manhattan federal court and saw a man collapse to the ground, Agnifilo recalled to The Post.\n\nThe veteran defense attorney — who had been on his way to meet with Combs in a holding cell inside the Lower Manhattan courthouse — then straddled the ailing man, who was hitting his head on the marble floor, and laid him on his side so that he wouldn’t choke on his tongue or vomit, he said.\n\nAgnifilo’s law partner Jacob Kaplan then placed his backpack under the man’s head, while his daughter Sofia Agnifilo, who’s working for the firm as a paralegal, and a member of Combs’ family helped make sure the man was breathing and checked his pulse, the lawyer said.\n\n“I can’t imagine a busier five-minute period in my life,” Agnifilo said Thursday. “I’m going down to see Combs, everything was so intense, and my mind was on the case, and I walk out, and a man falls and is clearly seizing.”\n\n“It seemed pretty dire. I was worried about him,” Agnifilo added.\n\n“I’ve just dealt with lots of seizures,” the lawyer further explained. “I just know exactly what to do because I’ve dealt with this before.”\n\nAfter the man appeared to stabilize, Agnifilo said he left the scene before EMS workers arrived. Cameras caught the man being taken out of the courthouse on a stretcher minutes later.\n\nThe status of the man was unclear.\n\nThe lawyer said that he then briefly met with Combs before walking out with the rest of the legal team to do a press conference with a throng of media.\n\nCombs, 55, was convicted Wednesday morning of two prostitution counts, but acquitted of stiffer sex trafficking and racketeering charges after a two-month-trial that shed light on his repeated beatings of his girlfriends, and his taste for “freak-offs” — sex marathons with male escorts.\n\nAgnifilo — who made the eyebrow-raising claim that Combs’ relationship with ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura was“kind of a great modern love story”despite her testimony that he beat her — also said Thursday that he woke up in the middle of the night before the verdict convinced Combs would only be convicted on the two lesser counts.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between.Subscribe here!\n\nHe said he texted his law partner Teny Geragos at 3 a.m. to start preparing a bail application — which would only make sense if Combs were to be found guilty on the lower charges.\n\n“I believed that he would be convicted on the Mann Act and acquitted of anything else,” the lawyer claimed, referring to the legal name for the prostitution charge.\n\nCombs faces up to 10 years in prison on each of two counts at his October sentencing.",

    "News_title":"The battle to sway voters over Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ begins",
    "News_text":"For months, more than a dozen Hill Republicans have been sounding the alarm about the steep Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s sprawling agenda package, which is now just hours away from becoming law.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis called cuts to Medicaid “inescapable.” Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley called Republicans’ targeting of Medicaid “a mistake.” Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, who once declared he wouldn’t support anything with over $500 billion in cuts, said he reluctantly supported the Senate’s nearly $1 trillion in cuts because of other tax breaks in the bill.\n\nNow, Democrats are turning those precise GOP warnings into the centerpiece of their strategy to seize control of Congress in the midterms next November.\n\n“It’s 2018 all over again,” said Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, a Democrat who holds one of his party’s toughest, most Trump-friendly swing seats.\n\n“I’m not gonna predict the future but I think today was a pretty bad vote for them,” Golden told CNN, adding that he did not consider voting for the GOP bill, despite billions for border security and military funding. “I would never vote for these Medicaid cuts. Never.”\n\nRecent polling so far shows Republicans have a tough sales job ahead of them, with53 percent of votersopposing the bill in a Quinnipiac University poll from June. But the GOP plans to hit back, armed with their own argument that Democrats stood in the way of broadly popular tax breaks for many Americans, billions more for border security and additional support for American troops. They argue that Democrats are vastly exaggerating the cuts to Medicaid, most of which come from work requirements largely targeted at able-bodied adults without dependents who don’t work or attend school 80 hours a month.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson described the bill as the “most comprehensive, complicated piece of legislation” in recent memory, and “arguably in the top two or three in the history of the Congress.” Trump praised the legislation at an event in Iowa on Thursday and suggested using Democrats’ opposition to it on the campaign trail.\n\nNew York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis offered an emphatic defense of the legislation while calling Democratic critics “liars” and accusing them of “fearmongering.” And she argued for the new Medicaid work requirements by saying, “Nobody loses benefits if they choose.”\n\nBut Democrats insist they have a far more potent message.\n\n“We will look back on election night last November, on what just happened this week, culminating with this vote today, as the beginning of the House majority for Democrats,” Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania told CNN.\n\n“There’s nothing more effective than a member of Congress saying things in their own words about how bad this bill is,” added California Rep. Ami Bera, who is heavily involved in the Democrats’ campaign operation.\n\nHe pointed to Republicans like Rep. David Valadao, whose rural California district is heavily reliant on state and government aid. Roughly two-thirds of people in his district get their health insurance from Medicaid. “This is really a bad vote for David,” Bera said.\n\nThe bill cuts nearly $1 trillion over a decade from Medicaid, which has seen its costs balloon since an Obama-era expansion of that program across 40 states. Roughly 12 million people could lose health insurance by 2034 because of the changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Some of the starkest impacts won’t be felt for years, and the bill’s work requirements won’t take effect until the end of 2026.\n\nAhead of its final passage, the “big, beautiful bill” was already the subject of anintenselobbying campaign, with more than $35 million spent on advertisements in June in an attempt to sway members and their constituents.\n\nThose ad wars are continuing, as outside groups and dark money networks on both sides prepare large advertising campaigns for the coming weeks and months in a race to define the sprawling legislation.\n\n“After this vote, every time you wait longer at a doctor’s office or get a higher utility bill in the mail, it’s gonna have a ‘brought to you by MAGA’ disclaimer to go along with it,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who has worked on House races.\n\nA collection of Democratic outside groups – including Save My Care, Protect Our Jobs, Unrig Our Economy and others – areset to spendseveral million dollarsbetween the beginning of July and the end of the year, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact, targeting about a dozen key seats. Many were on the air throughout June and have continued launching new attack spots amid the legislative wrangling this week.\n\nDemonstrating the reactive posture, Unrig Our Economy launched a new spot following Thursday’s vote, targeting GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani, from Arizona’s competitive 6th Congressional District, linking criticism of his vote to the July 4 holiday deadline.\n\n“While Americans are celebrating our country with family, friends, and fireworks, Republicans in Congress just passed the largest cut to Medicaid in history,”the ad says, singling out Ciscomani.\n\nHouse Majority Forward, a nonprofit affiliated with House Democratic leadership, is creating ads to hit multiple vulnerable Republicans later this month, including Reps. Scott Perry in central Pennsylvania, Tom Barrett in southern Michigan and Derrick Van Orden in western Wisconsin, according to a person familiar with the plans.\n\nA spokesperson for the organization, CJ Warnke, said in a statement that Democrats “will use their own words against them in our ads next year, and we will take back the House in 2026.”\n\nVan Orden, for his part, shrugged off any analysis predicting that millions of people would lose coverage because he doesn’t trust the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n“The state of Wisconsin is going to get an additional billion dollars a year for our healthcare system. That’s why I’m not worried about any of the junk you’re talking about with reelection,” Van Orden said, adding that he’s also getting $500 million for rural healthcare infrastructure.\n\nDemocrats still have work to do to win the messaging battle against Trump’s legislative agenda. Polling conducted on behalf of House Democrats last month showed that few battleground voters knew much about the GOP’s massive tax and spending cuts package, which initially passed the House in May, according to PowerPoint slides of the data presented to members, obtained by CNN.\n\nIn a private meeting to discuss the 2026 midterms, House Democrats brought in an outside pollster who presented internal Democratic polling that showed few voters said they had heard “a lot” about the bill, while larger shares said they had heard “a little” or “not at all.”\n\nSome Democrats saw the data as a warning sign that their party is struggling to land political hits against the bill.\n\n“Don’t allow Republicans to define this bill,” said one slide in the presentation, which was obtained by CNN.\n\nKey Democratic outside groups are already at work fine-tuning the messaging with off-year races in Virginia and New Jersey and the 2026 midterms in mind, aiming to raise voter awareness of the cuts to safety net programs.\n\nA research report commissioned by one of those groups, Protect Our Care, and obtained by CNN, showed survey results for ads across 11 battleground districts, aiming for movement among 2024 Trump voters and swing voters and developing content “effective at lowering the job approval of Republican incumbents.”\n\n“Pairing the Republican effort to cut Medicaid with the simultaneous reduction in taxes on the rich and corporations is an effective way to reduce Republican job approval,” the report said.\n\nRepublicans are readying their own attacks on Democrats for voting against the more popular provisions in Trump’s first big legislative priority, emphasizing tax cuts and border security.\n\nIn a political memo obtained by CNN the day of the House vote, the National Republican Congressional Committee previewed the case it will make, saying that “House Republicans will be relentless in making this vote the defining issue of 2026.”\n\n“Every Democrat voted to hurt working families and to protect the status quo. This vote is now their political identity, and the NRCC will work every day from now until next November to brand House Democrats with it,” the memo says. And Republicans argue that Americans generally support the idea of work requirements for federal safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nGOP Rep. Tim Burchett, who represents the Knoxville-area in Tennessee, insisted that the bill would not complicate reelection chances for his colleagues in swing districts.\n\n“America understands that things like, if you’re able to work, you ought to work. We need to clear up some of the fraudulent behavior so that it provides for those single moms with two kids that are maybe just getting by and it doesn’t collapse the system,” Burchett said.\n\nBut North Carolina Rep. Chuck Edwards, a Republican who had raised concerns about the bill and the potential impact of Medicaid cuts, expressed some lingering reservations about the legislation.\n\n“No bill is perfect,” Edwards said. “I wish I had more time to digest the Senate’s version and have one-on-one dialogues back at home, but I believe that we’ve made some steps in the right direction.”\n\nAsked about his message to constituents who could lose access to Medicaid under the new policies, Edwards said, “I don’t see a situation at this time where anyone that is entitled to Medicaid would be losing it, but I’d be open to hear folks’ thoughts and ideas as they might see differently.”\n\nMeanwhile, Securing American Greatness – a group aligned with Trump’s political network and its mountain of funds – and several other Republican outside groups have been on the air amid the legislating, providing support to members in battleground districts.\n\n“Congressman Ryan Mackenzie just voted for working family tax cuts that mean higher wages and lower taxes for working families,” saysone of the group’s ads, running in support of the freshman representative from a swing district in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe pro-Trump group, which spent nearly $8 million in June, is also at work hitting battleground Democrats over their opposition to the bill. “Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez voted for a 22% tax hike on working families,” saysanother spottargeting the Washington Democrat coming off two consecutive narrow elections.\n\nMatt Gorman, a Republican strategist, laid out the task ahead of Republicans. “This is the culmination of the best two weeks Trump has had since he became president,” he said. “Now it’s up to the GOP to sell this bill to a base that needs to turn out next November.”\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, asked if he’s worried about people losing health care, told reporters with a post-vote victory cigar in his hand: “It’s just some Americans, who aren’t Americans. Just illegals.”\n\nCNN’s Ali Main, Arlette Saenz and Aileen Graef contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Starmer has revealed himself to be the most politically hopeless PM of my lifetime",
    "News_text":"We are told that it was “personal” reasons whichcaused Rachel Reeves to weep at Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday. No doubt that is true. But when a prominent person weeps on a public occasion, the tears are prompted by a confluence of the personal and the political.\n\nWhatever upset Ms Reeves felt was surely compounded by her desperate and isolated political situation following thecollapse of the Government’s welfare reform Bill.\n\nThe first Rachel wept, as is recorded in the Old Testament Book of Jeremiah. She was weeping for her children, but hers were public tears too: she was revered as the wife of the patriarch Jacob and mother of Joseph. God told her: “Refrain thy voice from weeping and thine ears from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded.”\n\nIt has to be said that Sir Keir Starmer was rather less generous to his Rachel than was the Almighty to the Mother of Israel. When, across the floor of the House, Kemi Badenoch pointed out to him that his Chancellor “looks absolutely miserable”, he did not turn round to comfort or even to check. Nor did he take up the Leader of the Opposition’s invitation to confirm Ms Reeves in her post.\n\nBefore the session ended, the Prime Minister did say something about being “grateful” to her, but by then it was too late. Afterwards, No 10 declared that Ms Reeves was “going nowhere”, a phrase which, in the circumstances, was either tin-eared or barbed.\n\nIn an interview, Sir Keir insisted she wouldcontinue as Chancellor for the next election and for years beyond. He is in no position to make such a promise.\n\nPeople often complain about the “bearpit” of PMQs. This week’s half hour was certainly uncomfortable to watch, but it did show why such occasions can make a difference. In a few minutes of parliamentary theatre, we got to the heart of the matter.\n\nIn passing, it is worth pointing out that Mrs Badenoch did well. With wit and concision, she identified Labour’s key embarrassments – the second U-turn at the very last moment, the fact that a cost-cutting Bill will now save nothing at all and Sir Keir’s problem that “he does not know what he believes”.\n\nShe seized the chance to get her own party back on the long road to the economic respectability it so badly lost in government. Whereas Labour had just voted for spending more money, she said, the Conservatives know the nation must “live within its means”. Sir Keir’s capitulation vacates the political ground of prudence, giving the Tories the chance to re-occupy it – and at a timewhen Reform has decided to become a big-spending party.\n\nIn the end, those who want to give ever more public money to people who do not want to work are fewer than those who do work and will now almost certainly have to pay higher taxes. On this point, Mrs Badenoch spoke with justified confidence.\n\nAn oddity caused by the slow Conservative leadership election process last year is that Mrs Badenoch has still not addressed her annual party conference as leader, so the troops do not feel they know their general. Now she has a victory under her belt to celebrate with them. She has won on some other subjects recently, such as thegrooming gangs inquiry, but this week was her first big breakthrough.\n\nMore important right now is what all this means for the Government which we might still have for four more years.\n\nAgain, PMQs gave useful optics. Most of the time, the camera concentrated on just three people on the front bench – the Prime Minster in the middle, inexpressive as usual; to the right, the crumpled Chancellor, in a blue suit, trying and failing to conceal her distress; to the left, in a striking all-red number, the Deputy Prime Minister,Angela Rayner, head erect and smiling in a nothing-to-do-with-me sort of way. You could see the future, and why it won’t work.\n\nIt still seems almost incredible that a government only a year old should have cut off its room for future progress so early. There may be a case that the public finances, though bad and getting worse, are not so disastrous that all is lost, but history does suggest that such a serious failure of economic and political will is very hard to come back from.\n\nWilson’s Labour government lost confidence after having to devalue the pound in 1967, and lost the election in 1970. Heath’s Tories executed their U-turn on free markets and non-intervention in 1972, and lost (twice) in 1974. Labour went “cap in hand” to the IMF in 1976, and lost to Mrs Thatcher in 1979. John Major’s Tories won a general election in April 1992 but had to take the pound out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September. Tony Blair trounced them in 1997.\n\nIn some of these cases, notably Major’s, the economy did recover, but in all of them the government was seen to have failed in its economic stewardship. The voters duly punished it.\n\nThis time, the Government has undoubtedly failed. Labour’s selling-point to the electorate a year ago was that, unlike the Tories, andparticularly the horror story of Liz Truss, it would restore growth and control the public finances with enough discipline that the proceeds of that growth would improve public services. It has taken only 12 months, almost to the day, to discredit all those promises.\n\nIn reaction, some have criticised the rebel Labour MPs who forced Sir Keir’s retreat for their economic illiteracy. Downing Street special advisers speak unattributably to lobby journalists with foul-mouthed quotations about the idiocy and self-indulgence of their party’s backbenchers.\n\nIt is true that social media have made MPs more narcissistic and less loyal to their party. It is also true that failure to rein in welfare spending is –along with the NHS– the road to national ruin. But Sir Keir and his political advisers seem to have a very hazy idea of what it is like to be a member of Parliament.\n\nWith all aspects of social policy, MPs will have numerous constituents who will be directly affected and will complain to them. Most MPs of the governing party will be prepared to justify unpopular government policy if they can do so as part of a big story of foreseeable recovery or of dire necessity. It is incredibly hard to do so, however, when the policy unexpectedly removes existing money from claimants, and when the overall picture of what the government is trying to do is so contradictory and confusing.\n\nIn the case of personal independence payments (PIPs), there are a great many scandals (some recently documented by the TaxPayers’ Alliance) about how easily people can get the money for inadequate or trumped-up reasons. A government set on persuasion could have dramatised such freeloading to win over voters. It did not. Instead, it suddenly threatened millions of claimants, thwarting reasonable expectations. You don’t have to be aZarah Sultana-style Corbynistato worry. Any decent MP would want to voice those discontents at Westminster.\n\nIn my lifetime, and therefore in the lifetime of the great majority, no Labour government has ever been able to cope with bad economic conditions. They have been boom-time phenomena, triumphantly so in the case of Tony Blair’s first two terms. Sir Keir’s administration has quickly reverted to this depressing type, adding a political incompetence that would make anyone weep.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Iran is quietly resuming indirect nuclear talks with the US despite strong opposition from hardliners, The Telegraph can reveal.\n\nTehran’s supreme national security council told the foreign ministry to reopen talks with the Trump administration, aiming to revive diplomacy after a12-day war with Israellast month that saw the US bomb key Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nTehran and Washington heldfive rounds of talks from April 12. The sixth round was cancelled after Israel launched strikes on Iran on June 13.\n\nA senior Iranian official who spoke to The Telegraph from Tehran said: “The supreme national security council has told the foreign ministry to resume negotiating with America to persuade Trump that Israel was wrong to strike Iran.”\n\n“The other goal is to stop the reimposition of UN sanctions before it’s too late,” the official added, referring to a provision in the 2015 nuclear deal that would see sanctions automatically come into effect on Oct 18 if Iran breaches its nuclear commitments.\n\nIt came after reports emerged thatSteve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s envoy, was due to travel to Oslo next week to restart nuclear talks with Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister.\n\nMr Araghchi wrote in a Lebanese newspaper this week: “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s acceptance of the request to stop the war has created another opportunity for comprehensive diplomacy.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, was aware of the renewed talks. He has not been seen in public since before the start of hostilities with Israel, which ended in afragile ceasefire brokered by Donald Trump.\n\nKhamenei holds ultimate authority over Iran’s political, military and ideological matters, including foreign policy and national security. The president and parliament operate under his influence.\n\nThe disappearance has fuelled speculation about his health, whereabouts and the stability of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Iranian official who spoke to the Telegraph said the new talks are expected to take place quietly, without publicity, due to strong opposition from hardliners in Tehran.\n\nSepehr Khalaji, who was a senior official in the administration offormer Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi, has warned officials against engaging in any talks with the United States.\n\nKhalaji said Tehran should avoid dialogue with Washington after “America martyred 1,000 of your citizens, struck our nuclear facilities, violated our airspace, took our commanders and scientists, and threatened our supreme and beloved leader”.\n\nTheIranian regime celebrated the end of the war as a “victory”, however this unity has quickly descended into disagreements between hardliners and moderates over the country’s future.\n\nHardliners believe they have a chance to bring the country together and show the West’s weakness, while moderates say the the regime should be open to dialogue.\n\nUnder hardline influence, Iran’s parliament has banned International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from entering sensitive nuclear sites. These included Fordow, whichIranian officials confirmed was “seriously and extensively” damagedduring the US attack.\n\nThe last UN nuclear inspector left Tehran on Friday morning.\n\nIran has intensified its long-standing criticism of the IAEA, with some lawmakers and regime-affiliated mediaissuing death threats against Rafael Grossi, its director general.\n\nThe agency has confirmed that its inspectors have now left Iran, which means the regime could continue its nuclear work without international oversight.\n\nModerate officials in Tehran are however reportedly urging the Khamenei to engage with the West.\n\nConcerned about the potential for further conflict, former president Hassan Rouhani has asked top clerics to help push for a change in the establishment’s position.\n\nHe warned that if the crisis continues, the Islamic Republic could collapse and the role of the clergy could weaken.\n\nAli Larijani, the former parliament speaker, has also reportedly tried to use his influence and family ties to convince Khamenei to allow talks with the US.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Voices from the Arab press: When the ceasefire prolongs the war",
    "News_text":"A weekly selection of opinions and analyses from the Arab media around the world.\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat, London, June 27\n\nAccording to an old saying, the history of any war is written by the victor. This is because the loser is either dead, too wounded to write, or, in some cases, eager to turn the victor into a friend. But for that saying to hold true, the war must conclude with a recognized victor. That presents another problem: no one can crown themselves triumphant and place a laurel on their head unless their opponent formally admits defeat.\n\nThis is the dilemma Israel has faced ever since it fought to secure its small place on the map. Each time it won a war, it was forced to accept ceasefires imposed by its friends. This time, too, it was the US – yet again – that robbed it of the spoils of victory. The do-gooders who forced a “conflicting” final outcome forgot that the purpose of war is to disrupt an unstable status quo and replace it with a new one acceptable to the warring parties, by defining clearly who prevailed and who was defeated.\n\nWar, as the saying goes, is politics by other means. But here, world powers have turned war into a deceitful form of diplomacy, resembling a game of snakes and ladders. Some foreign leaders profited from meddling, winning elections, or even receiving the faintly absurd Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nSince 1947, dozens of new states have emerged on the map, and dozens of wars have erupted, with winners and losers alike, establishing a new reality that has secured long periods of peace and stability. In all those cases, war, which Aristotle considered among humanity’s noblest endeavors, served as the means to determine who won and who lost. The purpose of war is to slice through the Gordian knot with a single stroke and then let things return to their natural course. As for the advocates of ceasefires, they turn war into a knife left inside the wound, to be twisted again and again.\n\nIn some cases, a ceasefire can be the enemy of peace. That could be the case with the ceasefire ordered by US President Donald Trump between Israel and Iran, which temporarily froze a conflict that had simmered for nearly half a century since Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, made it his mission to eliminate the “Zionist entity.”\n\nBy any military measure, Israel achieved a sweeping victory in the12-day warthat Trump halted. It seized control of Iranian airspace within 48 hours, paving the way for US B-2 bombers to wipe out Iran’s core nuclear facilities within hours, meeting no resistance. Israel also decapitated the Iranian military leadership dominated by the Revolutionary Guards, destroying the Quds Force’s headquarters that had long coordinated Iran’s operations in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and Yemen.\n\nACCORDING TO Iranian estimates, Israel damaged or destroyed the Islamic Republic’s military and nuclear infrastructure by hitting over 600 targets, inflicting more than $1.8 trillion in damage. In a classic display of military precision, Israel struck targets in 20 of Iran’s 31 provinces without losing a single warplane.\n\nFatemeh Mohajerani, spokesperson for President Masoud Pezeshkian, claimed the Israeli attacks killed over 600 people, including 54 women and children. Among the dead were 23 generals with one or two stars, along with 300 other military personnel, including noncommissioned officers. Forty-six Iranian nuclear scientists were also killed, while 4,746 Iranians were wounded. On the Israeli side, Iranian retaliatory strikes killed more than 30 people, among them an 18-year-old conscript, and left 3,238 wounded.\n\nOrdinarily, this would have made Israel the clear victor in the 12-day war. However, as before, it is labeled the loser by Iran and, even more disturbingly, by certain self-proclaimed experts in the US and Europe. To further complicate matters, President Trump cast himself as the victor who ended the war by “eliminating Iran’s nuclear program forever” and securing a ceasefire within 24 hours.\n\nIran tried to outbid Trump in claiming victory. “We broke the American bull’s horns and rubbed its nose in the dirt,” said Mohammad Reza Aref, the first vice president of Iran. Tehran’s propaganda machinery seized on the fact that the war lasted 12 days. An editorial on Tasnim News, tied to the Revolutionary Guards, bragged: “The Arabs, led by Egypt, collapsed after six days against the Zionists in 1967. But the Islamic Republic withstood the Zionists and their American backers for 12 days, forcing them to beg for a ceasefire.”\n\nIran’s official media quotedThe New York Times, CNN, and other Western networks questioning Trump’s and Israel’s declarations of victory. Iranian outlets showcased prominent Western voices backing Iran’s narrative, among them John Mearsheimer, David Attenborough, Noam Chomsky, and Jeffrey Sachs.\n\nIran’s claims of triumph have emboldened Khomeinist hardliners to prepare for another round of fighting. “We have defeated the Great Satan and his Zionist agent,” proclaimed Gen. Ebrahim Jabbari, a one-star general. “But we must not stop there. We must keep our boot on Netanyahu’s neck until he chokes.”\n\nOnce again in Middle Eastern history, a ceasefire dictated by short-term political calculations is set to prolong a conflict that has raged for decades, with each new phase bloodier than the one before. –Amir Taheri\n\nAl Rai, Kuwait, June 28\n\nAll that truly happened was thatPresident Donald Trumpemerged, at least on the surface, as the victor from the Iranian-Israeli confrontation, having capitalized on Iran’s urgent need for a ceasefire in a war during which he had initially floated the idea of regime change before pulling back. Will Iran accept Trump’s statements that he does not seek regime change – along with its own missile strike on the Al Udeid base in Qatar – as enough to claim that it overcame its war with Israel and emerged victorious?\n\nIran is positioning itself as triumphant despite the heavy losses it suffered, and despite having been compelled to abandon its nuclear ambitions, its ballistic missile program, and its network of regional proxies such as Hezbollah. Preserving the regime itself became Iran’s overriding priority after Israel succeeded in taking the war directly into Iranian territory, assassinating a significant number of military leaders and nuclear scientists, and exposing the deep vulnerabilities of the Iranian regime.\n\nOne telling sign of the weakness of the Islamic Republic was the language its officials used throughout the conflict, appealing to international law and highlighting their supposed commitment to legal principles. Suddenly, the Islamic Republic remembered international law, conveniently forgetting its long record of promoting its regional ambitions through assassinations, violence, coercion, and sectarian incitement.\n\nOne need only look at its domination of Lebanon, a project that began more than 43 years ago with the Revolutionary Guard’s first deployment to a Lebanese army barracks, the Sheikh Abdullah barracks in Baalbek. The Lebanese experience illustrates the broader collapse of Iran’s expansionist strategy, which effectively unraveled with Bashar al-Assad’s flight from Damascus on December 8, 2024.\n\nFor decades, Iran had pursued its goals in Lebanon, often under Syrian cover, with tireless determination and the tacit acceptance of Israel, which itself is hardly a model of respect for international law. Iranian influence in Lebanon culminated in the 2023 war in support of Gaza, through which Tehran demonstrated that it ultimately controlled the Lebanese state’s decision-making power via Hezbollah.\n\nIRAN’S SUDDEN rhetorical embrace of international law and the UN Charter is deeply ironic, given that since the 1979 overthrow of the shah, the Islamic Republic has repeatedly shown contempt for these very norms, most memorably during the 444-day hostage crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran beginning in November 1979. It is hardly necessary to look far to see that Iran has never truly respected international law but instead followed its own rules, exploiting America’s periodic willingness to treat Iran as a useful boogeyman for pressuring Gulf states into viewing the US as their only protector.\n\nThis dynamic, marketed under the slogan of “exporting the revolution,” has played out for decades. It is useful, even today, to remember Iran’s activities in Lebanon from the very first days, including the kidnapping of David Dodge, the president of the American University of Beirut, who was eventually released from Tehran after being routed through Syria.\n\nSuccessive American administrations have too often remained silent about Iran’s outrages. In the 1980s, they stayed silent about the kidnappings of Americans such as CIA station chief William Buckley and Col. William Higgins, who was working with the UN’s international observer mission in southern Lebanon.\n\nUS administrations likewise ignored Hezbollah’s violence, which ultimately prompted the withdrawal of US forces from Lebanon after the bombing of the US Embassy in Beirut and the suicide attack on the Marine barracks near Beirut airport on October 23, 1983.\n\nNowhere in Iran’s regional record does respect for international law appear – unless one truly believes that the assassination of Rafic Hariri and his companions on February 14, 2005, was carried out in accordance with the UN Charter on Human Rights. That killing was designed to crush the only serious attempt to revive Beirut and Lebanon after decades of civil war, which began with the conflicts of April 13, 1975. This is precisely what President Joseph Aoun should have noted, instead of ignoring it, during the celebration of lighting up Martyrs’ Square and Nejmeh Square.\n\nTheoretically, the Israeli-Iranian war has stopped. The direct American intervention on Israel’s behalf during this conflict will stand as one of its most consequential chapters since hostilities erupted on June 13, 2025.\n\nHowever, the cessation of open warfare does not mean the challenges facing the Iranian regime have vanished. Those challenges persist, despite the collapse of its regional expansionist project, the uncertainty now surrounding the regime’s own survival, and the demonstrated ability of Israel to penetrate both Iran’s security services and its society at large.\n\nUltimately, the Iranian regime, in its current shape, is viable without the engine of regional expansionism, no matter how many victory celebrations are staged to suggest otherwise. –Kheirallah Kheirallah\n\nAl-Ittihad, UAE, June 28\n\nIt is too early to confirm that Israeli society has fully accepted the results of the recent confrontation with Iran, or that what was achieved represents a historic victory, as Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu is currently promoting.\n\nThe fragile national consensus that emerged may persist for several reasons, chief among them the continued presence of the Iranian threat regardless of the confrontation that took place. This issue will provoke intense disagreement within the government and across the political and military establishment in the coming period, especially as the war on Gaza resumes.\n\nWhat occurred with Iran could well repeat itself in Gaza, while the current situation might be exploited politically and strategically to pursue a long-term truce. All parties involved in managing the Gaza conflict know that the matter is in the hands of President Trump, who, if he chooses, could replicate what he did between Iran and Israel rather than allowing the process to slip back into a vicious cycle of pointless negotiations.\n\nWithin this context, the stability of the government itself may need to be reassessed, based on the fact that – contrary to some perceptions – Netanyahu’s government is not in a political deadlock, neither domestically, thanks to a relatively solid majority in the Knesset, nor internationally, especially given support from the US and major European powers, which reached its peak when the US joined the war effort and then pressed for a ceasefire under Trump’s influence.\n\nAlthough the Netanyahu government continues to hold a clear parliamentary majority – officially resting on 65 out of 120 seats – in practice, its backing is closer to 69 members of parliament. These dynamics were reflected in two recent polls, by Channel 13 andMaariv, which showed the Likud party gaining around four seats compared to surveys conducted before the conflict.\n\nThe point is that despite the appearance of broad political consensus and a near-popular alignment, certain reservations have arisen about the timing of the war, its results, and Israel’s ability to achieve its stated objectives of completely dismantling Iran’s nuclear program or toppling the Iranian regime. The military establishment will continue to play a decisive role on these matters, especially given recent shifts within the army’s leadership and intelligence circles, and considering the scale of the recent confrontation with Iran.\n\nIt is expected that the current governing coalition will continue a policy of preserving unnecessary ministries, advancing the tax evasion law, alienating the ultra-Orthodox from military service and broader Israeli society, supporting education budgets for the ultra-Orthodox who do not participate in the liberal state education system, ignoring the high cost of living, and avoiding structural reforms that do not support sustained economic growth – trends that could once again deepen societal divides and return Israel to the state it was in before the Iran clash.\n\nThis concern has already driven the Knesset to raise the defense budget by NIS 3.6 billion [$1.1b.] for 2025, an increase that includes NIS 699 million [$208m.] to fund food shipments to Gaza residents and NIS 2.953 billion [$877.4 million] to cover expanded military costs from the resumption of the war on Gaza.\n\nOne can stress that Israel’s political future will depend on the degree to which the public accepts the outcome of the present circumstances and on whether the Hezbollah-Israel agreement and the Iran-Israel agreement can hold up over the medium term.\n\nAdded to this are the massive losses the government will be forced to absorb, which public opinion will bear and the opposition will spotlight among voters, constantly repeating warnings about the persistent Iranian threat in the region, particularly with its ongoing missile and nuclear program. This is likely to become a central argument for the opposition and fuel continued tensions over Israel’s national priorities, which in turn could lead to more fragmentation.\n\nHerein lies the danger to the broader political stability that Netanyahu claims, even as he seeks to highlight Israel’s successive victories and the supposed total neutralization of the Iranian threat, despite the severe costs to the Israeli home front. Overall, disagreements will inevitably surface between political and military leaders about the post-conflict phase with Iran and the renewed war with Hamas, which may expose the realities of many details previously kept under wraps.\n\nNetanyahu will remain a dominant figure in politics and party circles, maneuvering skillfully and emphasizing the strategic options he still has to counter for those calling for early elections, in light of Israel’s ongoing existential threats and the reality that the confrontation with Iran has not truly ended – an argument his supporters may well accept as the opposition struggles to present a coherent, workable alternative. –Tarek Fahmy\n\nAl-Masry Al-Youm, Egypt, June 28\n\nNow that thewar between Iran and Israelhas ended, a common question echoes among Israelis and Iranians alike: who emerged as the victor, and who the loser? The acceptance of a ceasefire after 12 days of fierce fighting between Iran on one side and Israel and the US on the other followed a series of public and back-channel negotiations, culminating in US President Donald Trump announcing a ceasefire, claiming the US had achieved its objective of destroying Iran’s nuclear capacity.\n\nThis was soon followed by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu declaring that Israel had removed what he described as an existential nuclear threat, celebrating what he framed as a historic victory over Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian proclaimed the war’s end after what he hailed as a heroic resistance, affirming Iran’s victory thanks to the steadfastness and sacrifice of its people. Thus, all three parties emerged to declare victory. But who, in reality, won, and who lost?\n\nEarly assessments suggest that Israel initiated the conflict and successfully dismantled Iran’s air defense network, completely disabling the Iranian air force and leaving its skies open to Israeli aircraft, which launched what were described as “painful” and “effective” strikes on military targets, nuclear facilities, oil infrastructure, and Iranian leaders and scientists. Afterward, the US intervened with devastating airstrikes on the three most important nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with President Trump exchanging words of victory with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nOn the Iranian side, Tehran managed to demonstrate its resilience, exposing vulnerabilities in Israel’s multilayered air defenses by striking military installations, research centers, and key economic targets in Haifa, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, and other cities.\n\nPerhaps most symbolically, Iran was able to replicate, even on a smaller scale, the images of destruction long familiar in Gaza, projecting those scenes onto Israeli cities in a way never before seen in Israel’s history. Iran did not allow the US airstrikes to go unanswered, responding with a “coordinated” attack on the American Al Udeid air base in Qatar, an operation that effectively marked the transition toward a ceasefire.\n\nIn my view, what has happened amounts to a fragile pause, with the question of victory or defeat deferred until further notice, pending fresh negotiations between the Iranian and American sides on several critical files, foremost among them Iran’s nuclear program. The second issue will be Iran’s ballistic and multi-warhead missile capabilities, and the third concerns Iranian-backed armed factions, the Palestinian resistance, and Iran’s evolving regional role.\n\nThe manner of the ceasefire declaration provided a convenient face-saving exit for all sides, allowing them to proclaim victory before their domestic audiences. Yet the coming negotiations on these thorny matters will ultimately determine where this conflict heads. There is no doubt Iran’s nuclear program has been heavily damaged, and it will require years to recover.\n\nHowever, the real test lies in the days ahead: will the US, along with its protégé Israel, be content with what has already been accomplished, or will they remain determined to continue reshaping the region to meet Israeli interests, at the center of which is the ambition to change or even overthrow the Iranian regime?\n\nSadly, all the lessons of history point to Israel’s deep-rooted belief in aggression and territorial expansion as fundamental to its doctrine, meaning peace, quiet, and any cessation of war are merely temporary way points, with Israel poised to resume its limitless expansionist aims.

    "News_text":"FedEx Corp. next month will implement a streamlined pricing structure for parcel pickups in the U.S. and Canada aimed at simplifying the customer experience. The move is made possible by the company’s ongoing campaign to collapse separate Express and Ground delivery networks into a single operation.\n\nThe new rating structure, which takes effect Aug. 18, will charge one fee for both expedited or standard shipping, even if FedEx (NYSE: FDX) performs two pickups in the same day. For regularly scheduled and automated pickups, customers will be charged weekly based on the number of pickup days. On-demand pickups will be charged per-stop,FedEx explained on its website.\n\n(Automated pickups occur if participating shippers generate a shipping label by a specified time. If no shipping label is generated on a given day, the pickup is automatically canceled.)\n\nFedEx said business customers have long clamored for a single pickup instead of having to prepare packages for separate FedEx Express and FedEx Ground pickups, often on the same day. FedEx this year is ramping up the rollout of its Network 2.0 strategy for integrating the two networks into a single one under the FedEx Express brand. The goal is to increase efficiency by consolidating parcel sorting in common facilities and having a single van deliver parcels to neighborhoods rather than different vans crisscrossing the same area multiple times per day.\n\nIn early June, Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx folded together the operation of 30 stations across 11 local markets and was on track to combine another 33 stations across nine markets by the end of the month, CEO Raj Subramaniam said during the company’s earnings presentation on June 24. About 2.5 million packages, or 12% of total volume, are now flowing through consolidated facilities on an average daily basis.\n\nThe new pricing structure benefits customers by providing consistent and straightforward rates instead of customers having to track costs by the service offering being used, according to the carrier. It also provides more control in scheduling pickups because businesses can select the number of regular pickup days that fit their needs. Rather than charging ad hoc pickup fees per-package, FedEx will charge per-stop, which likely will save shippers money. And on-call shipments can be consolidated into regular pickups, further streamlining pickup activity.\n\nFees will vary based on the day of pickup and how it is scheduled. A future-day pickup, for example, will cost $9 or $10.50 per stop, depending on whether it is scheduled online or by phone. A same day on-call pick up will cost $14.75 or $16.75.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves\/PostalMag stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nFedEx to close 30% of package facilities as network integration ramps up\n\nSwitch to UPS saved US Postal Service 43% in air transport costs\n\nFedEx navigates tariff swings to modest profit gain\n\nFedEx retires a dozen freighter aircraft in efficiency move\n\nThe postFedEx to implement single pricing structure for express, standard pickupsappeared first onFreightWaves.",

    "News_text":"The Bank of England could cut interest rates more than markets expect if Rachel Reeves puts up taxes in the autumn, economists have said.\n\nThe Chancellor is widely expected to announce tax rises at the next Budget after U-turns on welfare reforms and winter fuel payments left her needing to find £6.5bn of savings. Economists at Deutsche Bank have warned the Chancellor could face a £32bn black hole in the public finances later this year.\n\nGovernment borrowing costs surged on Wednesday after Ms Reeves made atearful appearance in the Commons, which raised concerns that she could be replaced with someone less committed to the Government’s borrowing rules.\n\nThe bond market turmoil subsided after Sir Keir Starmergave his backing to the Chancellor, who today underlined her commitment to fiscal rules in her first public appearance since her emotional outing at Prime Minister’s Questions.\n\nThe Chancellor said her adherence to the Government’s borrowing and spending rules “has meant that we can boost investment in the public services”.\n\nEconomists have warned keeping to the fiscal rules will mean Ms Reeves will be forced to raise taxes in the autumn to keep within her fiscal rules, after the Government’s U-turn on its welfare reforms indicated it is politically too difficult to cut spending.\n\nKallum Pickering of stockbroker Peel Hunt said another round of tax increases by the Chancellor would mean the Bank of England “could go even further with rate cuts than it currently indicates”.\n\nMoney markets imply that there will be around three more rate cuts by the Bank by April next year, which would take the Bank Rate from 4.25pc to 3.5pc.\n\nMr Pickering said: “Tax hikes would depress demand and inflation.\n\n“Assuming inflation is roughly back to target next year, the Bank of England should be able to offset any demand-slowing tax increases with easier monetary policy – from a Bank Rate of 4.25pc it has a lot of headroom to cut.\n\n“This story should become clearer over time as the temporary energy-related inflation hump fades and if the Government is indeed forced to significantly raise taxes.”\n\nLondon’s stock market and the pound recovered today, having taken a knock Wednesday on rumours that Rachel Reeves could leave her job.\n\nThe FTSE 100 rose 0.6pc, while the FTSE 250 rose 1.2pc, according to preliminary numbers.\n\nThanks for joining us on this live blog today. You can continue reading ourcommentary and news on business and the economy here.\n\nThe cost of government borrowing remains higher than Tuesday, despite reassurance from Downing Street that Rachel Reeves will remain in office.\n\nThe yield on 10-year gilts has dropped today to 4.547pc, having closed yesterday at 4.612pc. But on Tuesday, before the Government’s about turn on welfare became fully apparent, gilts were at 4.454pc.\n\nBruna Skarica, chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley, told Bloomberg: “The combination of low growth and high debt interest cost implies difficult fiscal choices.\n\n“The UK has a very short lifespan of its fiscal rules. Hence, market participants see this as a live risk.”\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touched fresh record highs this afternoon after a stronger-than-expected jobs report pointed to a resilient labour market amid concerns about Donald Trump’s tariff policies.\n\nNvidia was trading at a record high, up as much as 2.4pc, and is nearing a $4 trillion (£2.9 trillion) valuation.\n\nData showed non-farm payrolls increased by 147,000 jobs last month after a 144,000 advance in May. Unemployment fell to 4.1pc last month, against expectations of a rise to 4.3pc.\n\n“We were all expecting the hard data would start to show some cracks, and we really haven’t seen that with the jobs report coming in much better than expected,” said Brian Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management.\n\n“That just puts the Fed on pause and gives it more time to wait right now because the labour market is really resilient.”\n\nWall Street remained high this afternoon after encouraging new figures for the US services sector were released.\n\nEconomic activity in the services sector grew last month after a single month of contraction, according to data from the Institute for Supply Management.\n\nThe services purchasing managers index hit 50.8pc, above the 50pc break-even point for 11th time in the last 12 months.\n\nThomas Ryan, of Capital Economics, said: “The rebound in the ISM services index in June is broadly consistent with our view that economic growth will slow rather than collapse in the second half of the year.”\n\nSince Wall Street opened this afternoon, the Dow and Nasdaq have risen 0.9pc, while the S&P has gained 0.8pc, after jobs data was released earlier.\n\nStock markets around the world are surging after the better than expected US jobs figures – and it has put one of Wall Street’s tech darlings on course for a massive milestone.\n\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia is now less than $100bn away from becoming the first company in the world to have a $4 trillion market capitalisation.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite in New York was up 0.9pc while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained 0.7pc, even though the US employment increase means a Federal Reserve interest rate cut has been all but ruled out for July.\n\nWall Street’s gains have lifted global markets, with the FTSE 100 up 0.5pc and the mid-cap FTSE 250 gaining 1.1pc.\n\nLeft-wing Labour MPs will push up the cost of government borrowing, analysts have warned, amid fears they have “increasing control” over public spending levels.\n\nUK gilt yields have staged a recovery today from the sharp surge on Wednesday, when traders were concerned that Rachel Reeves could be replaced with a chancellor less committed to her “ironclad” fiscal rules.\n\nHowever, yields remain higher than they were before the government’s U-turn on its benefits bill, which is expected to give the Chancellor a £5bn headache as she tries to balance the nation’s books.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said a “risk premium has been attached to UK bonds, which is likely to remain until the Autumn Budget”.\n\nShe said: “The premium this time is linked to Labour’s left having increasing control over Kier Starmer and pushing him for ever greater levels of public spending.\n\n“If the Government wants to avoid an embarrassing and devastating fiscal crisis, they need the guts to cut public spending to more reasonable levels. The bond vigilantes are circling, and Labour could be forced to U-turn on the U-turns.”\n\nThe cost of borrowing in the US lurched higher after stronger than forecast jobs figures all but wiped out the chances of a cut to interest rates in July.\n\nThe US 10-year Treasury yield rose six basis points to 4.33pc, the fastest rise for any major sovereign debt today.\n\nIt also reduced some of the rally in UK gilts, which had been staging a recovery after the turmoil caused by Rachel Reeves’s emotional appearance in the Commons on Wednesday.\n\nSome economists expressed surprise at how the jobs figures had been received by the market.\n\nSamuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics pointed to the fact most of the increase in US nonfarm payrolls was down to jumps in state government and health care employment:\n\nWall Street jumped to fresh record highs at the opening bell after stronger than expected US jobs figures.\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 0.4pc to 6,254.49 while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6pc to 20,514.88 after both closing at record highs on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3pc to 44,623.11.\n\nThe US economy added more jobs than expected amid rising state government and health care employment, official figures show.\n\nEmployment in state government increased by 47,000 in June, largely in education, according to the Labor Department, while health care added 39,000 jobs.\n\nThe White House tweeted “trust in Trump” and hailed the “Trump effect” as non-farm payrolls increased by 147,000 in June, well ahead of expectations of 106,000.\n\nYet Bradley Saunders of Capital Economics said the data showed “the increasing narrowness of the labour market’s strength”.\n\nMarket commentators appear unanimous that the stronger than expected US jobs figures have killed any chances of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month.\n\nThere has been no word yet from Donald Trump after the stronger than expected US jobs figures, which have weakened the case for the interest rate cuts he has been urging the Federal Reserve to deliver.\n\nThe US president said on his Truth Social account on Wednesday that he wanted Fed chair Jerome Powell to quit, suggesting he was too late to cut interest rates.\n\nLindsay James, a strategist at wealth manager Quilter, said: “As has been a theme for some time now, the US economy continues to confound expectations, with the labour market adding 147,000 jobs in June, well above consensus expectations and recent averages.\n\n“Furthermore, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1pc, suggesting that the US economy remains in robust shape.”\n\nHe added: “With the end of the 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs ending next week, it was thought that the slowdown was under way.\n\n“However, for now this seems to be far from the case. These job numbers will get far more attention than usual too because investors are watching for any sign that the labour market is beginning to weaken sufficiently to trigger an interest rate cut in July.\n\n“Despite negative GDP growth in the first quarter and data suggesting the US is beginning to experience the pricing impacts of the tariff policy, this is yet to feed into the wider economy and the jobs market continues to grind away.\n\n“Ultimately, this gives Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve the cover it will want to hold rates at the next meeting.”\n\nUK borrowing costs rose after stronger than expected US employment figures forced traders to scrap bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates this month.\n\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts – a benchmark for the cost of servicing Britain’s national debt – spiked after US non-farm payrolls grew by 147,000 in June, well ahead of analyst forecasts for 106,000.\n\nDerivatives traders rapidly rearranged their positions to leave the chances of a Fed rate cut in July at just 5pc, compared to 25pc before the figures were published.\n\nWhile UK borrowing costs are still down on the day overall, the 10-year gilt yield climbed three basis points after the data to 4.56pc.\n\nThe yield had stood at 4.45pc at the end of trading on Tuesday before concerns over Rachel Reeves’s position sent them surging as high as 4.61pc.\n\nThe US economy added more jobs than expected last month, official figures show, weakening the case for interest rate cuts despite concerns that Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught could impact hiring.\n\nNon-farm payrolls grew by 147,000 in June, according to the Labor Department, up from an upwardly revised 144,000 in May.\n\nIt was well ahead of economist expectations for just 106,000 jobs to be added to the economy.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell from 4.2pc to 4.1pc while average annual earnings slipped from 3.9pc to 3.7pc.\n\nMortgage demand from home buyers is expected to soften over the summer, according to a Bank of England survey of lenders amid warnings borrowers “are finding it harder to repay”.\n\nLenders reported that demand for mortgages for house purchase had increased in the past few months but was expected to decline over the three months to the end of August.\n\nHome buying costs became more expensive for some buyers from April, as stamp duty discounts became less generous. Stamp duty applies in England and Northern Ireland.\n\nIt comes as the Bank of England is predicted on money markets to cut rates two more times before the end of the year.\n\nKen James of broker Contractor Mortgage Services said: “The figures are a sign that some borrowers are finding it harder to repay, even though we have seen a strong appetite to lend and credit becomes more available.\n\n“While default rates remained stable, the share of money lenders fail to recover when a borrower default saw a slight increase.\n\n“Lenders anticipate this will continue rising in the coming months, reflecting ongoing financial pressure on households. The fact that losses are expected to increase shows the pressure many households are under.”\n\nThe pound remained steady in the wake of the turmoil caused by the brief uncertainty over Rachel Reeves’s future.\n\nThat could all change when the official US jobs figures are unveiled in less than an hour.\n\nThe dollar remained close to three-and-a-half year lows against major currencies ahead of the non-farm payrolls numbers, which are expected to show the US economy added 106,000 jobs last month.\n\nA big miss could change the outlook for interest rates, as Donald Trump continues to pile pressure on policymakers at the Federal Reserve to cut borrowing costs.\n\nSterling was up last up 0.1pc at $1.366, while the FTSE 100 was 0.5pc higher.\n\nOn Wall Street, stock indexes were tentatively higher in premarket trading after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all up 0.1pc ahead of the opening bell.\n\nBond traders have said the turmoil in financial markets shows traders actually want Rachel Reeves to stay in post as chancellor.\n\nMike Riddell, fixed income portfolio manager at Fidelity International, said: “The conclusion from financial market price action yesterday afternoon is that the market actually likes Rachel Reeves.\n\n“Of course it may not be about Reeves specifically, but the market pricing in uncertainty regarding a potential change in future policy.\n\n“Ultimately,  Reeves leaving might be bad news for UK borrowing costs if fiscal rules are changed or ditched, since it implies even bigger deficits and issuance.\n\n“But that’s not the only outcome.  If the UK does get a new chancellor, it could be someone at least as fiscally conservative, so may not be bad news necessarily from a market perspective.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer would trigger a fresh sell-off in the pound if he were to sack Rachel Reeves as chancellor, economists have warned.\n\nDiana Iovanel of Capital Economics said investors view Ms Reeves as “fiscally prudent relative to potential alternatives”.\n\nShe said the sharp sell-off in the pound and UK bonds on Wednesday was “driven not by a loss of confidence in her but by speculation that she’ll be replaced”.\n\nShe said: “All that suggests to us that if Reeves was replaced it would probably spark a renewed gilt-sterling selloff, rather than a recovery.\n\n“It also suggests that, as long as the Chancellor retains her job, some of the recent risk premia in UK markets will probably continue to fade.”\n\nRachel Reeves said her commitment to her fiscal rules would allow more investment as she has appeared in public for the first time since her tearful outing at Prime Minister’s Questions.\n\nBorrowing costs fell today after Sir Keir Starmer gave his backing to the Chancellor following turmoil on bond markets caused by concerns that he could replace Ms Reeves with someone less committed to steadying the public finances.\n\nIn a public show of unity, the Chancellor appeared alongside the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Wes Streeting at a health centre in London. The latter praised her setting aside £29bn for investment in the health service in her spending review.\n\nShe said: “I want to be clear, we are spending money on taxpayers’ priorities, but that wouldn’t have been possible without the measures that we took in the budget last year.\n\n“We fixed the foundations and we’ve put our economy back on a strong footing.\n\n“Our commitment to the fiscal rules has meant that we can boost investment in the public services.”\n\nShe went on to say the Government was “making this country fairer for those who have paid in all their lives by guaranteeing that the NHS will be there when they need it”.\n\nMs Reeves added: “This is the right way forward, good for the health of our nation and good for the health of our nation’s finances.\n\n“This Government will always deliver on the priorities of ordinary working people, and I am proud that with this plan the NHS will always be there for those who need it for the next 77 years, and many more beyond that too.”\n\nThe UK bond market has become more sensitive to potential shocks as pension funds and the Bank of England have reduced their exposure to gilts, a broker has warned.\n\nLower liquidity in markets tends to cause bigger swings in asset prices. Gilt yields - a measure of government borrowing costs – surged higher on Wednesday amid concerns that Rachel Reeves could be replaced as Chancellor with someone less likely to adhere to her fiscal rules.\n\nDarius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services, said: “It’s fair to say the UK gilt market is more sensitive than US Treasuries, and there are structural reasons for that.\n\n“The gilt market lacks the same depth and liquidity, and two of the largest historical buyers – pension funds and the Bank of England – have stepped back in recent years, leaving a gap in demand. Long-dated gilts, in particular, now look riskier given the UK’s fiscal trajectory.\n\n“That said, the US isn’t immune either. Trump’s climbdown on tariffs was a result of the bond market’s reaction, not the equity markets. And, despite the rhetoric, Trump understands he cannot fire Powell even if it was within his power, as the market consequences would be severe.\n\n“But in the UK, with a shallower market and limited long-term demand, any signal of political or fiscal uncertainty – especially around the Chancellor – gets amplified quickly.\n\n“Investors are understandably cautious. More borrowing and higher inflation are real risks. With a relatively flat yield curve, it’s no surprise many prefer to sit in shorter-dated debt for now.”\n\nHousebuilding stocks recovered on the FTSE 100 as the Prime Minister gave his backing to the Chancellor.\n\nBond yields surged on Wednesday at the sharpest pace since April, hurting interest rate-sensitive sectors like homebuilders and real estate.\n\nBerkeley and Persimmon dropped 8pc and 6pc respectively on Wednesday.\n\nHousebuilders rose as much as 2.2pc today across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 as gilt yields – a measure of borrowing costs – fell back as Sir Keir Starmer insisted Rachel Reeves’s job was safe.\n\nVistry was the biggest gainer, up 3.2pc, with Bellway and Crest Nicholson up 2.1pc.\n\nBritain’s dominant services sector has cut jobs for nine consecutive months, a closely watched survey showed, after the Chancellor raised taxes on employers.\n\nPrivate sector companies cut jobs at a faster pace than in May, according to the S&P Global UK Services PMI.\n\nHowever, the services industry grew overall at its fastest pace in 10 months despite shrinking export sales amid “headwinds from US tariffs and geopolitical tensions”.\n\nTim Moore, economics director at S&P Global, said: “Concerns about elevated payroll costs meant that service providers were reluctant to turn on the hiring taps.\n\n“Employment numbers decreased for the ninth month running and at a faster pace than in May, with job shedding again often attributed to redundancies as well as the non-replacement of voluntary leavers.\n\nHe added: “A combination of easing price pressures and lower employment leaves the door open for the Bank of England to resume its run of interest rate cuts at the next policy meeting in August.”\n\nThe Bank of England could cut interest rates more than the market expects if Rachel Reeves puts up taxes in the autumn, economists have said.\n\nKallum Pickering of stockbroker Peel Hunt said another round of tax increases would mean policymakers “could go even further with rate cuts than it currently indicates”.\n\nMoney markets imply that there will be around three more rate cuts by the Bank by April next year, which would take the Banks Rate from 4.25pc to 3.5pc.\n\nMr Pickering said: “Tax hikes would depress demand and inflation.\n\n“Assuming inflation is roughly back to target next year, the Bank of England should be able to offset any demand-slowing tax increases with easier monetary policy – from a Bank Rate of 4.25pc it has a lot of headroom to cut.\n\n“This story should become clearer over time as the temporary energy-related inflation hump fades and if the Government is indeed forced to significantly raise taxes.”\n\nUK borrowing costs will rise further as the U-turn on the benefits bill raises questions about the Government’s ability to “take hard decisions”, bond investors have warned.\n\nGilt yields – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt – have recovered some ground today after Sir Keir Starmer gave his firm backing to Rachel Reeves.\n\nBorrowing costs had surged on Wednesday over concerns about the Chancellor’s future.\n\nMohit Kumar, chief Europe economist at Jefferies, warned that today’s recovery was not expected to last.\n\nHe said official estimates of UK growth were “too optimistic” which would likely “put a big fiscal hole in government finances”.\n\nHe added: “The latest u-turn on benefits bill has raised questions on the ability of the government to take hard decisions and bring down government spending.\n\n“The other alternative is to raise taxes which looks like a distinct possibility on the upcoming budget. Problem is that tax raises hardly ever bring in the expected revenue and in many cases can be counterproductive.”\n\nHe said he held a “negative stance” on the outlook for gilts, adding he expected the Bank of England to cut interest rates at least twice this year and towards 3pc next year.\n\nGilts have rallied further in early trading after the Prime Minister gave the Chancellor his backing.\n\nThe 10-year yield – a benchmark for the cost of government borrowing – was down eight-basis points to 4.52pc, clawing back around half of surge on Wednesday.\n\nLonger-dated bonds had bigger moves, with the 30-year gilt yield down 10 basis points to 5.32pc.\n\nThe pound has steadied after reassurances from Sir Keir Starmer over Rachel Reeves’s future.\n\nSterling was last up 0.1pc against the dollar at $1.366 as the Prime Minister told Virgin Radio the Government remains committed to the fiscal rules and economic stability.\n\nDarius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services, said: “Ironically, Rachel Reeves may have provoked her own ‘Liz Truss moment’– not through policy excess, but through fears of what might follow her potential resignation.”\n\nHe added: “While Reeves’ policies may be flawed, the real concern for investors is that her replacement could push the party further to the left at a time when markets are desperate for signs of credible fiscal leadership.\n\n“Without a clear pivot towards tough decisions, the risk is this discomfort could spiral into a broader crisis of confidence in UK debt.”\n\nThe cost of government borrowing dropped sharply at the start of bond market trading after Sir Keir Starmer committed to keeping Rachel Reeves as chancellor “into the next election and for many years afterwards”.\n\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt – fell by six basis points to 4.55pc.\n\nHowever, the recovery was only partial, as borrowing costs remained higher than before the Chancellor’s tearful appearance in the Commons on Wednesday.\n\nThe 10-year yield surged 16 basis points higher after the Prime Minister initially failed to back her at the despatch box in one of the biggest moves since the mini-Budget crisis.\n\nLonger-term borrowing costs also eased, with the yield on 30-year gilts dropping by seven basis points to 5.35pc.\n\nThe FTSE 100 jumped higher a day after questions over the Chancellor’s future triggered turmoil in financial markets.\n\nThe UK’s flagship stock index climbed 0.4pc at the open to 8,812.05 a day after Rachel Reeves’s tears in the Commons left it as the only major European index to lose ground.\n\nThe mid-cap FTSE 250, which is more domestically-focused, also climbed 0.4pc to 21,534.56.\n\nOn Wednesday it suffered its biggest daily decline since the Liberation Day turmoil in early April, dropping by 1.3pc.\n\nThe slump in the pound despite surging borrowing costs was reminiscent of the Liz Truss-era meltdown in bond markets, analysts have said.\n\nThe 10-year gilt yield – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt – surged by nearly 16 basis points to 4.61pc on Wednesday, while 30-year yields climbed 19 basis points to 5.42pc.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said: “Interestingly, the pound sterling slumped as well, which isn’t what normally happens when longer-term interest rates are rising, as that should make the currency more attractive, other things equal.\n\n“So that was reminiscent of the market patterns seen after Liz Truss, and the pound fell 0.8pc against the US dollar, making it the worst-performing G10 currency yesterday.”\n\nHe added: “Looking forward, the immediate issue is that the Government left a very narrow margin in March against their fiscal rules they set themselves. And since then, that margin has disappeared thanks to factors like the spending U-turns and the tariff announcements after Liberation Day.\n\n“So unless we got a big burst of growth before the Budget, then the Government would need to announce further tax rises or spending cuts if they still want to meet the fiscal rules. So this leaves them in a tricky position.\n\n“On tax, they’ve ruled out raising several large taxes like income tax and VAT, and the tax rises already announced generated unpopularity. On spending, they’ve come under intense pressure in response to the spending reductions so far, which have resulted in U-turns.\n\n“And if they eased the fiscal rules, the fear would be a fresh market selloff like yesterday. So it’s not obvious which way they turn.”\n\nRachel Reeves’s position as chancellor has been made more secure by the sharp reaction in bond markets to questions over her future.\n\nWill Walker-Arnott, a director at wealth manager Charles Stanley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “This is a rare example of financial markets actually enhancing the career prospects of a politician.\n\n“The markets were concerned that if the Chancellor goes then any fiscal discipline would follow her out the door and that would mean bigger deficits, more gilt issuance and so, obviously, gilt yields went up.”\n\nInvestors will watch carefully what happens when trading opened on bond markets later after one of the worst performances since the Liz Truss mini-Budget crisis.\n\nTraders sold off UK gilts on Wednesday, sending the cost of government borrowing higher, amid concerns about the future of Chancellor Rachel Reeves.\n\nChristian Kopf, head of fixed income at asset manager Union Investment Group, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Often we see jitters in the bond market which is caused by external events but yesterday it was different.\n\n“It was clearly caused by Prime Minister’s Questions and by domestic events in the UK and the movement was very swift and very stark.\n\n“It’s about the future of the fiscal rule in the UK. Chancellor Reeves stands for that fiscal rule. Investors were growing concerned about the prospect of very high fiscal deficits that are no longer compliant with the fiscal rule and that would then give rise to higher yields and a weaker pound sterling.\n\n“So people are really concerned about the consistency of economic policymaking in the UK.”\n\nThanks for joining me. The value of the pound slipped further despite Sir Keir Starmer’s assurances that Rachel Reeves will remain as Chancellor “into the next election”.\n\nSterling dropped nearly 1pc on Wednesday and government borrowing costs surged after the Chancellor shed tears in the Commons and the Prime Minister failed to back her when questioned at the depatch box.\n\nHe later backed her but the pound and gilt yields – the return the government promises to buyers of its debt – failed to recover from one of the sharpest moves since the Liz Truss mini-Budget crisis.\n\nMohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said: “The concern in markets is that a new chancellor may not be as committed to the fiscal rules.”\n\nIn early trading, the pound was last down around 0.1pc against the dollar at $1.364 and was 0.2pc lower versus the euro, which was worth 86.5p.\n\nAsked about Ms Reeves’s emotional state on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC: “It was a personal matter for the Chancellor and I’ve been absolutely clear with you it has got nothing to do with politics, nothing to do with any discussion between me and Rachel, nothing to do with the matters of this week.\n\n“She will be the Chancellor for a very long time to come. She is going to be the chancellor into the next election and for many years afterwards.”\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\nBorrowing costs surge on speculation over Reeves’s future| UK gilt yields soar as pound plunges after Prime Minister fails to back his Chancellor in Parliament\n\nCash Isa raid ‘will drive up mortgage costs’| Building societies warn over ability to raise funds for loans as Reeves’s plans to cut tax-free threshold\n\nMicrosoft to cut 9,000 jobs as chatbots take over| Tech giant sheds 4pc of workforce as executives order staff to hand tasks to AI\n\nTesla sales hit three-year low as Musk feuds with Trump| Billionaire criticised president’s bill that cuts incentives for electric cars\n\nKathryn Porter: The Heathrow fire report is not just damning for National Grid| The regulator should be monitoring standards, not just issuing fines after things go wrong\n\nAsian shares were subdued as investors braced for a key US jobs report and waited on the passage of Donald Trump’s tax cutting bill in Congress.\n\nWall Street climbed overnight to close at new record highs after President Donald Trump announced that the US has struck a trade deal with Vietnam, including a 20pc tariff on exports to America. That is lower than the 46pc tariff that had been threatened, but still much higher than previous rates.\n\nVietnamese shares gained 0.5pc to the highest since April 2022. The local dong currency, however, dipped to a record low of 26,229 per dollar.\n\nJapan’s talks with the US struggled, while South Korea President Lee Jae Myung said tariff negotiations were looking difficult and he cannot say if talks can conclude by next Tuesday.\n\nTokyo’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.1pc to 39,794.16. In South Korea, the Kospi added 1pc to 3,106.46, while Australia’s S&P\/ASX 200 was down 0.1pc to 8,589.30.\n\nThe Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index lost 1pc to 23,976.41. The Shanghai Composite index edged up 0.1pc to 3,57.36 as data showed China’s services activity expanded at the slowest pace in nine months in June.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, at 44,484.42, the S&P 500 rose 0.5pc, finishing at 6,227.42, and the Nasdaq rose 0.9pc, to 20,393.13.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes rose to 4.284pc from 4.251pc on Tuesday night.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Are we in a moment of crisis?",
    "News_text":"The specter of a constitutional crisis has haunted more than one American presidency. From the Civil War to Bush v. Gore, moments of institutional stress have provoked warnings that the Constitution itself might be faltering. In recent years, that phrase — “constitutional crisis” — has become a staple of the national conversation, debated so often in op-eds, podcasts, and cable news segments that it risks becoming cliché. But what does a true constitutional crisis actually look like? And are we living through one now?\n\nWe asked three legal thinkers — each with a distinct worldview and constitutional philosophy — to wrestle with that question. Their answers are surprising, provocative and not uniform.\n\nFormer federal judge Thomas Griffith offers a deeply personal reading of the crisis. After decades working within the system — as Senate counsel, appellate judge and teacher — he’s come to see the Constitution’s most radical promise not in its checks and balances, but in its blueprint for unity. Griffith argues that the true constitutional emergency isn’t institutional overreach — it’s toxic polarization. And the framers, he believes, left us a roadmap out.\n\nIlya Shapiro, of the Manhattan Institute, challenges the premise altogether. What some interpret as crisis, he argues, may be the product of a hyperpolarized political culture now overlaying — and distorting — judicial interpretation.\n\nNoah Feldman, a Harvard law professor and scholar of constitutional history, looks at the question through an unexpected lens: Latter-day Saint theology. He finds in that religious tradition not only a belief that the Constitution is divinely inspired, but a moral imperative to defend its protections for all flesh — citizen and noncitizen alike — especially in moments of strain.\n\nTogether, these essays don’t deliver a tidy answer. They offer something better: a serious and conflicting set of diagnoses from minds deeply immersed in the Constitution’s design and purpose. The result is a portrait of a system under pressure — and a debate about where we go from here.\n\nBy Thomas B. Griffith\n\nI missed it. Although it was always right before me for decades, I totally missed the most important purpose of the Constitution.\n\nI’ve been an eager student of the American Constitution since high school. I dutifully and happily carry my pocket copy of the Constitution with me wherever I go. Though not a scholar, I read what the best scholars of the Constitution have to teach us about this remarkable document. In my spare time, I listen to podcasts and read books and articles about the Constitution. In my legal career, I’ve been the chief lawyer for the United States Senate, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and currently am a lecturer in law at a law school. Each of these positions required that I study the Constitution.\n\nAnd in my study, I had always assumed that the Constitution was created to protect our rights — and it does — and to create a federal government of enumerated and limited powers — and it does. But what I had not realized until recently is that an even more fundamental purpose of the Constitution and the chief aim of its drafters in 1787 is to show us something about which its framers cared deeply and should speak to us with great force today: how to get along with people with whom we disagree. In other words, the Constitution can show us how to get out of the mess we are in.\n\nAdd me to the list of those who argue that the nation is facing a constitutional crisis. In fact, the crisis I see is the most serious threat to the Constitution since the Civil War. But this crisis is not about the power of the president or the roles of Congress and the courts. It’s not about a threat to the freedom of speech, the free exercise of religion, or equality of opportunity. Those are vital principles and precious rights about which we must always be vigilant. The crisis that threatens the Constitution is the toxic political polarization that has beset the nation in recent years. Ironically, much of that polarization is driven by people who think that they are defending the Constitution, but who miss its primary purpose the way I had. When their zeal is fueled by contempt for those with whom they disagree, their words and actions become a threat to the Constitution.\n\nSocial science research supports what we have all experienced firsthand. Too much of our public discourse is animated by contempt. As Arthur Brooks notes, “Political scientists find that our nation is more polarized than it has been at any time since the Civil War.” Recent surveys show that the level of enmity between Republicans and Democrats in America today approaches the levels between Protestants and Catholics during the Troubles in Northern Ireland and between Palestinians and Israelis today. We aren’t accustomed to think of ourselves in that company, but here we are.\n\nOver 70 percent of Republicans think that Democrats are “immoral.” Over 60 percent of Democrats think the same of Republicans. Such contempt is a cancer on the body politic. As the late conservative columnist Michael Gerson noted, “(The Constitution) is designed for vigorous disagreement. It is not designed for irreconcilable contempt.” The social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, not one prone to apocalyptic forecasts, predicts, “(T)here is a very good chance that ... we will have a catastrophic failure of our democracy.” The reason? “We just don’t know what a democracy looks like when you drain all trust out of the system.” Actually, we do know what that looks like: the January 6 storming of the Capitol.\n\nBut there is good news. A large majority of Americans are tired of this toxic polarization, and there is a way out. In fact, the Constitution itself and the way it was created provide a road map forward.\n\nAs Yuval Levin points out in his paradigm-shifting book, “American Covenant: How the Constitution Unified Our Nation — And Could Again” (the most important book on the Constitution I’ve ever read), the Constitution is an answer to the question of how the people of a nation as diverse as ours can act together even though we don’t think alike. The preamble to the Constitution announces its purpose is to “form a more perfect union.” The first third of the Federalist Papers are primarily about how the Constitution can help us achieve unity among people with differing views. “(C)reating common ground,” Levin notes, “is a key purpose of the Constitution. ... It does so by compelling Americans with different views and priorities to deal with one another — to compete, negotiate, and build coalitions in ways that drag us into common action even (indeed, especially) when we disagree.”\n\nAnd this is done through the structure of the government the Constitution creates. The discussion during the Constitutional Convention in 1787 was primarily about the best structure of the government they were creating and how it might achieve national unity amid diversity. There was precious little discussion that summer about rights. (Fortunately, that would come four years later with the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution.)\n\nThink for a moment about the structure of the national government the Constitution creates. It’s terribly complicated. Law is made by the common action of three different institutions — the House of Representatives, the Senate and the presidency — chosen by different groups of people at different times. Anyone who has worked for the passage of a bill will attest to how difficult it is for a proposal to run this gauntlet and become law. This system is not built for efficiency. It is built to slow down proposals in hopes that any law that emerges will be carefully considered and the result of negotiation and compromise among the elected representatives of “We the people.”\n\nAbsent the rare landslide election that sweeps into power a president whose party has large majorities in both houses of Congress, the only thing one wins in an election to the House, the Senate or the presidency is a seat at the negotiating table where you must bargain with others whose support you need. Of course that support comes at a cost. We call that compromise.\n\nThe Constitution requires a different type of citizen than had ever been seen before on the world stage. A citizen who is willing to listen to his or her opponents, understand their concerns, and then be willing to compromise so that, to the extent possible, the various sides can find some common ground. Each side will have to give up something — those in the minority more than the majority. But that’s the genius of the Constitution. As Levin puts it, this complex process of lawmaking “compels Americans to be a little more accommodating of one another. It gives us practical experience in living and acting together.”\n\nThe most succinct description I have heard of what the Constitution requires of a citizen comes from President Dallin H. Oaks. Oaks is not only a leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but he is also one of the most widely respected scholars of the Constitution, having been a state Supreme Court justice and a professor of law at the University of Chicago before taking on his ecclesiastical responsibilities. In remarks on the Constitution that he gave to a worldwide assembly of the church in April 2021, President Oaks declared that “on contested issues, we should seek to moderate and to unify.” In a speech given at the University of Virginia later that year, President Oaks explained that the structure of the government the Constitution created could only work if there was good faith negotiation and mutual accommodation among citizens of differing views. And as he told former federal judge and Dean Emeritus David Levi in an interview in Judicature, it is antithetical to the Constitution to “expect or seek total dominance for our own positions.”\n\nA large majority of Americans are tired of this toxic polarization, and there is a way out. In fact, the Constitution itself and the way it was created provide a road map forward.\n\nSignificantly, this understanding of the purpose of the Constitution also describes the way it was created in the first instance at the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787. Those who created the government that requires good faith negotiation and mutual accommodation practiced what they preached.\n\nBy July 1787, it appeared that the work of the convention would fail. No agreement had been reached, and there was serious talk of delegates leaving for home. And yet by September, the delegates had cobbled together a Constitution. So unlikely was this turn of events that one popular history of the convention is titled “Miracle at Philadelphia.” I am a Christian, and I believe in miracles. But my understanding is that a miracle is an event that defies rational explanation, such as the parting of the waves during the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt, or the resurrection of Jesus. By this definition, no miracle took place in the summer of 1787. We know exactly how the delegates succeeded because George Washington told us. In his letter transmitting the proposed Constitution to the Confederation Congress, Washington wrote, “The Constitution, which we now present, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession, which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable.” Amity, mutual deference, concession. The delegates in Philadelphia practiced these virtues for the sake of creating a “more perfect union.”\n\nLegal scholar Derek Webb has done a deep dive into the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention to understand what Washington meant by amity, mutual deference and concession. The rules of the convention assumed that if you could gather together a group of people in the same room and have them listen to one another, they would change their minds, and that would be a very good thing. The delegates took their meals together in small groups that had people from South Carolina breaking bread with men from Massachusetts and discovering over time that they had more in common with one another than they had supposed.\n\nAnd there was much socializing among the delegates that summer. At key points in the summer, when tensions among delegates were on the rise, Benjamin Franklin threw lavish parties for them at his home and brought out his fine stock of port wine, which was gleefully enjoyed by all. All of this — the rules, the dinners, the parties — created an atmosphere in which the delegates, in the words of George Mason, grew “into some acquaintance with each other” and formed “a proper correspondence of sentiments.” In other words, they became friends who were willing to engage in good faith negotiations and seek mutual accommodations for the sake of unity. But they didn’t reach unity out of the goodness of their hearts alone. They did so because their backs were against the wall. Failure to reach compromise would have posed an existential threat to the new nation. As Washington put it, “the peculiarities of our political situation rendered (this approach) indispensable.”\n\nIs that where we are as a people today? I’m afraid so. That’s the bad news. But here’s the good news. We know how to overcome the toxic polarization that threatens our nation. It’s hard work, and it requires all of us to take to heart President Oaks’ charge, which is the charge of the Constitution itself, that “on contested issues, we should seek to moderate and to unify.”\n\nThomas B. Griffith was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by President George W. Bush in 2005. He retired from the D.C. Circuit in 2020 and is currently a lecturer at Harvard law school and a fellow at the Wheatley Institute at Brigham Young University.\n\nBy Ilya Shapiro\n\nWe didn’t get very far into the second Trump administration before political commentators started wringing their hands about this or that “constitutional crisis” that we’d stumbled into. Pundits took to the airwaves to allege that letting Elon Musk wreak havoc over federal agencies was the end of the republic, while law professors took to the op-ed pages to explain how the lack of due process in the administration’s deportation policy signaled our slide toward authoritarianism. And then ... the laptop class moved on to worrying about their 401(k)s in the face of tariff uncertainty and the political class to squabbling over the budget bill.\n\nSo were the crises averted? Did we survive to engage in our tribal fights another day, or is the danger still roiling in the background as the nation teeters on a precipice, metaphorically approaching midnight like a Doomsday Clock for the rule of law?\n\nThe answer depends on what you mean by all these weighty terms. A constitutional crisis is generally thought of as a problem in governmental operations or conflict between branches of power that a country’s foundational law is unable to resolve. Such a crisis can arise when the constitution fails, or is perceived as approaching failure, to give guidance to political actors regarding a contested situation — or those actors simply ignore it.\n\nSometimes constitutional mechanisms lead to political instability or other circumstances that lead political actors to contest each other’s legitimacy. Such was the case when the 1796 election resulted in a president (John Adams) and vice president (Thomas Jefferson) from different parties, and when Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr got the same number of electoral college votes in 1800. The rules were clear, but endangered stable governance, so the 12th Amendment was enacted to separate electoral votes for president and vice president.\n\nAt other times, the Constitution is legally ambiguous about an unforeseen circumstance, so a practical resolution — what law professors call “liquidation” — sets the precedent for averting future crises. For example, in 1841, it was unclear when William Henry Harrison died 31 days into his presidency whether John Tyler actually succeeded him or just became “acting president.” Tyler took the oath of office and thus settled the matter. (Tyler was politically enfeebled during his term because he lacked a base of support in either party in Congress — he was called “His Accidency” — but that’s a quirk of that era’s partisan flux and not any constitutional weakness.)\n\nA constitutional crisis could lead to governmental paralysis or collapse, democratic backsliding or even civil war. Indeed, by far the greatest crisis the United States ever faced involved Southern states’ rejection of Abraham Lincoln’s policies against the expansion of slavery, instead choosing to secede. Lincoln in turn refused to recognize the breakaway republic and brought the Confederate states back into the union by bloody force. One hopes that we’ll never have to test that “resolution” of the Constitution’s silence regarding secession.\n\nBut constitutional crises don’t have to rise to the level of Ken Burns documentaries. It’s not hard to conjure scenarios about which the Constitution would be ambiguous at best, or which opportunistic politicians would take advantage of to create doubts about the legitimacy of their rivals. Michigan State law professor Brian Kalt wrote a book in 2012 that lays out half a dozen hypothetical crises. “Constitutional Cliffhangers” discusses complications that could arise from:\n\nA president being criminally prosecuted.\n\nA president pardoning himself.\n\nCabinet members trying to oust a “disabled” president, who then tries to oust them.\n\nThe House speaker and secretary of state fighting for the presidency in the wake of the deaths of the president and vice president.\n\nAn ex-president being impeached.\n\nA two-term president trying to stay in power.\n\nSome of these don’t sound so fanciful after the political twists and turns of the last couple of decades, really dating back to Bush v. Gore in 2000, which wasn’t so much a crisis as a statistical tie for one state’s electors. But they all involve the office of the presidency rather than how the holder of that office wields his power. Those complaining about President Donald Trump don’t dispute his claim on the White House — this time around — but do accuse him of abusing his powers to the point of governing like the king who forced the hand of the founding generation to declare independence. One could certainly call the American Revolution a product of crisis in the British (unwritten) constitution.\n\nAfter all, the argument goes, firing agency heads, shuttering USAID, withholding funds that Congress appropriated, reversing environmental regulations by fiat, targeting law firms whose lawyers represent political adversaries, and putting the nation’s leading universities into federal receivership at the stroke of a hostile letter are all examples of an executive acting without any respect for legal or constitutional processes. Add in such things as unilaterally defining terms like “woman” and “gender” across the federal government — plus rescinding not just Biden or Obama executive orders on DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), but LBJ’s order on affirmative action — and you have, on this view, a president acting like the dictator he once mused himself to be.\n\nThe funny thing about all these examples is that institutional guardrails have held, just as they did in Trump’s first term with regard to the “travel ban” and other things that led to cries of constitutional crisis. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed on a host of issues, with injunctions against some actions and the administration ultimately winning its fair share of rulings. Some of these issues pose open or at least contested legal questions. For example, it’s likely that next year the Supreme Court will overturn Humphrey’s Executor, the 1935 case that insulates the heads of “independent” agencies from presidential control. Other issues are just a manifestation of the “pen and phone” governance patterned by President Barack Obama, which accelerated the shift to our current populist moment. You live by the executive order, you die by the executive order.\n\nMoreover, as singular an individual as Donald Trump may be, he’s not unique when it comes to pushing the envelope of executive power. President Joe Biden was judicially slapped down on issues ranging from vaccination mandates and eviction moratoria to environmental rules and student loan forgiveness — and even after the Supreme Court blocked his student loan plan, he kept trying to do the same thing using other statutory workarounds. Biden also, a few days before the end of his term, issued a bizarre declaration that the Equal Rights Amendment had been ratified, which the National Archives promptly rejected.\n\nWhat we have isn’t so much a constitutional crisis but legal manifestations of the political-cultural “vibe shift” we’ve been talking about since last November’s election.\n\nThere may be two novel examples of blatant Trumpian disregard for the constitutional order, but they don’t fit the crisis narrative because of their heterodox ideological valences. I’m thinking of the unilateral pausing of bipartisan legislation requiring the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok — which law survived Supreme Court review — and the “emergency” tariffs levied on the entire world. But even here, presidents of both parties have used the awesome tariff power that Congress delegated to them, with the judiciary’s acquiescence. So all of our constitutional branches seem complicit, but none of that threatens to destabilize the republic (as opposed to our economy) or lead to a cold civil war.\n\nBut what about more blatant disregard to the rule of law, such as the treatment of judicial orders regarding the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia or the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, or the revocation of hundreds of student visas over speech that the administration doesn’t like? Each of these examples is also legally contestable. For example, can a court order the president or his agents to engage in diplomacy, even if it wouldn’t be a big lift? Is it showing contempt to argue that a district court lacks jurisdiction when the Supreme Court ultimately agrees that habeas corpus claims must be filed where detainees are held? Can the United States not apply the rules regarding the visa ineligibility of foreigners who espouse certain disqualifying ideologies when those foreigners are already in the country?\n\nSure, it isn’t helpful to our political culture for a president and members of his administration to show disdain for or call for the impeachment of judges who rule against them. And the coy “after you, my dear Alphonse” dance performed by Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office thumbed its nose at the spirit, if not the letter, of the order requiring the government to “facilitate” Garcia’s return. But there’s been nothing like Andrew Jackson’s exclamation, “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!” — which even if apocryphal reflected Old Hickory’s opinion of judicial authority. And how do you weigh Trump’s behavior against attacks on the Supreme Court by the Biden administration — leading both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris to endorse court-packing — and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s threats against two justices if they ruled the wrong way on abortion? Or, more recently, Democratic lawmakers’ storming of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility and then claiming their arrests were somehow illegitimate?\n\n“They’re all bad” is a fair response, but “bad” does not a crisis make. A lot of what’s going on in the courts, for example, is procedural skirmishes over the proper scope and appealability of temporary restraining orders, or the propriety of nationwide or “universal” injunctions. The Supreme Court has been remiss in not giving lower courts more guidance on these technical issues — Chief Justice John Roberts’ project to keep the court out of the political discourse has backfired repeatedly — so it was heartening to see it take up the injunction issue, with a decision expected by the end of its current term in June or early July. (That argument was in the context of Trump’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship for children of people here temporarily or illegally. At least one law professor who worked in the Biden Justice Department has called that order a constitutional crisis in and of itself, but even as the longstanding practice to the contrary is clear, the meaning of the 14th Amendment isn’t.)\n\nIn short, what we have isn’t so much a constitutional crisis but legal manifestations of the political-cultural “vibe shift” we’ve been talking about since last November’s election. Courts are still more respected than any other part of government at a time of historically low societal trust, and confidence in the Supreme Court is still high relative to its coequal branches, but that’s despite the historically large difference in opinion by partisanship or ideology.\n\nIt’s apparent that Americans — especially American elites — have conflicting constitutional visions, and what we’ve seen lately is the confluence of trends where divergent interpretive theories map onto partisan preference at a time when the parties are more polarized and ideologically sorted than any time since at least the Civil War. There’s no easy way to “liquidate” those kinds of differences.\n\nIlya Shapiro is director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute and author, most recently, of “Lawless: The Miseducation of America’s Elites.” He also writes the Shapiro’s Gavel newsletter on Substack.\n\nBy Noah Feldman\n\nAmong the many fascinating and rich beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have always been especially engaged by the teaching that the U.S. Constitution is divinely inspired. Perhaps this is because I am, by profession, a teacher of constitutional law. For someone who has dedicated much of his life to studying the Constitution, there is something hopeful in the belief that it is part of a divine plan. When our constitutional traditions and values seem to be faltering, or when they face especially difficult tests and challenges, a degree of faith in the underlying endeavor of constitutional democracy can be particularly valuable.\n\nThis is one of those times. Since his inauguration, President Donald J. Trump, sworn to uphold the Constitution, has repeatedly taken unilateral executive actions that federal courts have determined to violate the letter and spirit of our foundational document and the laws duly enacted pursuant to it. These range from violations of the individual rights of people in the United States to violations of the separation of powers to violations of the rule of law, the underlying principle of the Constitution itself.\n\nTo be clear: This is not normal. The challenge to the Constitution, its norms and its values that we are currently facing is without precedent. Many presidents have occasionally taken actions reversed by the courts as unconstitutional. Congress has very occasionally passed laws that were struck down on constitutional grounds. But no previous president has acted similarly, taking scores of actions in a short period of time that, in the estimation of the courts, directly violated the Constitution and the laws.\n\nThe question therefore arises: What is the appropriate response to unprecedented challenge to constitutional norms at the highest level of the U.S. government? At the legal level, the answer is relatively simple. Affected parties can and should go to court to vindicate not only their rights, but the Constitution and the rule of law that it embodies. Courts should hear those claims, consider them in the light of the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, and rule accordingly. Then, all citizens must stand up for the Constitution as interpreted by the courts, insisting that the president and other executive branch officials comply with lawful court orders.\n\nWhat, though, is the right moral answer to the question of how to respond to unconstitutional conduct and attitudes? To address this question, which is more profound than the legal one, we need to understand the moral basis for the Constitution and its values.\n\nIn my view, there is no single moral theory of the Constitution that can be identified as definitively correct — at least in constitutional terms. Even if one believes in a single, unified, true morality, applying it to the Constitution will still be a matter of interpretation in which disagreement between reasonable people of goodwill is still possible.\n\nI have long been intrigued by one such interpretation, of one moral vision of constitutional purpose, expressed in terms of and grounded in Latter-day Saint doctrine and teaching. That interpretation begins with a universalist, inclusive ethic of constitutional purpose, as opposed to a narrow, nationalist one focused only on U.S. citizens and their interests. From there, it proceeds to the principles of judicial independence and the rule of law, conceived as necessary instruments for facilitating the universal vision.\n\nThis vision should be of interest not only to Latter-day Saint believers, but to people like me who do not belong to the faith, but who are committed to constitutional values and want our Constitution to have good moral reasons to exist and to survive.\n\nA good place to start is an important address delivered in April 2021 by President Dallin H. Oaks, first counselor in the First Presidency of the church, delivered during its semiannual general conference under the title “Defending Our Divinely Inspired Constitution.”\n\nFirst, a quick disclaimer: It is always tricky for someone who is not an adherent of a particular faith tradition to explicate a profoundly religious text. I offer my interpretation and application of President Oaks’ teaching in humility and respect for President Oaks and for the church, noting the obvious truth that I can in no way claim my reading is a faithful one, but can only pray that I have captured something of the spirit that, to my mind at least, permeates the speech.\n\nIn presenting the idea of the divinely inspired Constitution, President Oaks focuses not on Doctrine and Covenants 101:80, a very clear and direct statement of the Constitution’s divine inspiration, but another Latter-day Saint scripture (D&C 101:77), which refers to “the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles.”\n\nHere I want to emphasize a remarkable aspect of this verse: its universality. God says he intends the Constitution to protect “all flesh” — not just Americans or citizens of the United States. The resonant phrase “all flesh” is the biblical language most often used to invoke all humanity, regardless of belonging or membership. Consider, for example, Isaiah 66:23: “And it shall come to pass, that every new moon, and every sabbath, shall all flesh come to worship before me, says the Lord.” In Isaiah’s prophetic vision, just one verse after God has promised to make “the new heavens and the new earth,” all humans shall be united as one in the worship of the Lord.\n\nWhat does this mean in our current moment? It means, I would like to propose, that our Constitution does not simply protect U.S. citizens. It protects “all flesh” who live under its jurisdiction. That decisively includes noncitizens present in the United States — who themselves have long been held to possess fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nThis is a very particular moral reading of the Constitution — one that is universalist and inclusive. It is by no means the only way to read the text or the traditions of the Constitution. The notorious Dred Scott decision excluded people of African descent from “We the people,” and was overturned only by the Civil War and the Reconstruction amendments. In a 1990 decision, U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist suggested in nonbinding dicta that perhaps constitutional rights afforded to “the people” might not extend to noncitizens in the U.S.\n\nYet the 14th Amendment specifies that its protections extend to everyone who is a “person.” Thus, rights to life, liberty and property under the 14th Amendment have been held to apply to noncitizens in the United States. Similarly, in 1945, in the case of Bridges v. Wixon, the Supreme Court held that “Freedom of speech and of the press is accorded aliens residing in this country.”\n\nIt is beyond the purview of this essay to address technical issues of when and how fundamental rights protections under the Constitution apply to noncitizens. It should suffice to observe that D&C 101:77, as invoked by President Oaks, offers moral justification for the constitutional idea that all humans under the jurisdiction of the United States deserve protection. Views to the contrary are, I think, inconsistent with the moral vision of a Constitution.\n\nThe lesson is strikingly relevant. Constitutional protection of noncitizens has become an important and controversial topic under the Trump administration. Noncitizens have repeatedly been the targets of executive action, especially summary deportation without a hearing, that have been challenged as unlawful in the federal courts and found to be unlawful. A morally universal, inclusive Constitution requires, I believe, a deep commitment to protecting all people, not only citizens.\n\nFrom the universal moral principle, we can move on to the means of effectuating it. In his speech, President Oaks named “five divinely inspired principles.” These are, in brief, (1) popular sovereignty, (2) federalism, (3) the separation of powers, (4) the fundamental protections of the Bill of Rights, and (5) the Constitution as the embodiment of the rule of law, not of men.\n\nI find it noteworthy that President Oaks considers the separation of powers to be a divinely inspired aspect of the Constitution. As he notes, “the inspiration in the American convention was to delegate independent executive, legislative, and judicial powers so these three branches could exercise checks upon one another.”\n\nIt is through our actions that we will preserve our constitutional republic, or, heaven forbid, lose it.\n\nThe argument here is powerful and original: According to President Oaks, the contribution of American constitutional thought on the separation of powers is the idea of the independence of the different branches. That independence, according to this view, enables the branches to check one another.\n\nMake no mistake, the independence of the judicial branch is under genuine threat today. Repeatedly, the current presidential administration has either violated judicial orders (according to the federal courts) or come so close to doing so that judicial independence is threatened. At one point, the current president, posting on social media, called for the impeachment and removal of a federal district court judge who had issued a temporary restraining order adverse to the administration’s policy. In response, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare public statement explaining that “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.” Roberts, who cares deeply about preserving the independence of the judiciary, understood the president’s statement as seeking to intimidate the judiciary, thus undermining its independence.\n\nLast, and perhaps most important, President Oaks argues for the divine inspiration of the core constitutional principle that “we are to be governed by law and not by individuals.”\n\nAs President Oaks explains, since ours is a government of laws, “our loyalty is to the Constitution and its principles and processes, not to any office holder.” Whatever any president, including President Trump, may say, government employees and we the citizens ourselves do not owe fealty to the president. Our responsibilities and our oaths run to the Constitution, which is itself the supreme law of the land. This principle, alongside the principle that “all persons are to be equal before the law,” President Oaks writes, comes to “block the autocratic ambitions that have corrupted democracy in some countries.”\n\nThis point could hardly be more important for current constitutional conditions. The rule of law, which itself depends in practice on the independence of the different branches of government, exists to protect our freedoms against the power of any one person. The rule of law is intended to block “autocratic ambitions.” The complex of five constitutional values identified by President Oaks as divinely inspired together serve the underlying purpose of the Constitution identified in D&C 101:77, namely the protection of the freedoms of “all flesh.”\n\nOf course, one may accept all President Oaks’ arguments as a matter of political theory and constitutional principle without also embracing his belief, or the church’s doctrine, that the Constitution is divinely inspired. Such belief is, like other religious belief, very much a matter of personal faith and of the individual’s relationship to the concept of divine inspiration itself. As someone who is not a Latter-day Saint, I have no intention to encourage readers to adopt religious beliefs that they do not already have.\n\nAt the same time, I have engaged in the foregoing exegesis of Doctrine and Covenants 101:77 and of President Oaks’ message because I believe, with full faith, that today our Constitution needs all the commitment and assistance it can get. The Constitution today requires support from all sources, human and divine.\n\nIt is through our actions that we will preserve our constitutional republic, or, heaven forbid, lose it. Our fallible human agency means that the decision is in our own hands, as the establishment of the Constitution was in the hands of the framers who created the original compact and the all-important amendments that fulfill its promise by protecting liberty and equality. May we be worthy successors to those who came before us. May we leave to our posterity a Constitution that is worthy of the high aspirations we are bidden to fulfill.\n\nNoah Feldman is Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, chair of the Society of Fellows, and founding director of the Julis-Rabinowitz Program on Jewish and Israeli Law, all at Harvard University.\n\nThis story appears in the July\/August 2025 issue ofDeseretMagazine.Learn more about how to subscribe.",

This increase may be because of the large number of data centres that have been built there.”\n\nThe government data shows that Slough’s total commercial emissions rose from 183,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2005 to 280,000 tonnes in 2023.\n\nBy contrast, the emissions from the entire North East of England – a much larger area – fell from 2.9m tonnes in 2005 to just 960,000 tonnes in 2023.\n\nIt means emissions per person in the North East fell from 13.4 tonnes to just 3.1 tonnes – far lower than in Slough, and a direct consequence of the collapse of energy-intensive industries in the region.\n\n“The North East of England was the region with the largest proportional fall in emissions over this period, at 67pc, in part due to industrial closures,” said the report.\n\nSlough’s massive increase in commercial greenhouse gas emissions is linked to the arrival of an estimated 31 large data centres.\n\nThe concentration of data hubs – one of the densest on the planet – has seen Slough described as “Europe’s data centre alley”.\n\nIts explosive growth is linked to its proximity to London plus its positioning on the arterial cabling that links London to other countries including the US.\n\nThis means Slough has high transmission speeds – essential for meeting the demands of financial institutions, technology companies and companies that stream movies, which all need minimal delays in data transfer.\n\nSlough has long had a negative reputation– perpetuated partly by past poet laureate Sir John Betjeman’s famous poem of the same name whose first line reads: “Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!”\n\nDexter Smith, Conservative leader of Slough Council, said the new figures were a bombshell because of the borough’s aim of becoming carbon-neutral by 2040, with ambitions to achieve this by 2030.\n\nHe said Slough’s hopes of improving life expectancy for its citizens – currently 10 years lower than in surrounding boroughs – lay in opening the way for more such high-tech developments.\n\n“I would be devastated if the explanation for this data was down to Slough’s high concentration of data centres … We have 31 data centres with more on the way. Planning applications will have to comply with operating requirements that include stringent control of emissions and being carbon neutral,” he said.\n\nThe Data Centre Alliance, trade body for the industry, said Slough’s surging commercial emissions showed it was becoming a success story.\n\nVenessa Moffat, executive director, said: “Slough offers access to one of the largest business and financial ecosystems in the world without the real estate costs and power constraints of central London.\n\n“Every text sent, app downloaded, or movie streamed uses IT housed in data centres. But it’s not data centres that pollute – it’s the demand that we, as human beings, put on our digital infrastructure.”\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"After Labour’s week from hell, what happens next? Four scenarios",
    "News_text":"What happens next? That depends on what you think has already happened. Some things are beyond dispute.\n\nThere was the mostspectacular collapse of a flagship government programmein living memory and it occurred under the unforgiving televised gaze of the nation. Then the Chancellor of the Exchequer whose economic plan relied on that programme being passed, was seen in that same pitiless televised gaze,openly crying on the front bench. This, however it may now be described in dismissive, sympathetic terms, was truly shocking.\n\nThen what happened? The Chancellor and the Prime Minister who had notably failed to offer her unconditional support on that terrible occasion in the House, appeared together at a staged event, she wearing much heavier make-up than is normally her custom and both of them with fixed, rictus grins for the duration of the public appearance. The manic cheerfulness of their demeanour seemed designed to ensure that not a single still photograph would catch them looking anything but madly joyful.\n\nAt roughly the same time, a brazen spin operation was put into operation which made the perverse claim that the collapse of market confidence which this whole drama had provoked was actually an indication of how highly Ms Reeves was rated in the financial world.\n\nIt was, went the story, the threat that she might be about to lose her job that had caused this market wobble – not theshambles over the government’s attempt to reform welfareor the Chancellor’s own apparently uncontrollable despair.\n\nParadoxically then, Ms Reeves was safer in her position than ever. The official line is now that the thing that had so visibly distressed her was entirely personal: a private matter about which, needless to say, we have no right to enquire.\n\nThis account offers two possible outcomes. Either Ms Reeves can stay in her post indefinitely – because her presence there is so valued by those whose economic judgement determines the country’s fate – or she can use the “personal problem” account as a reason to resign. It is easy enough to imagine a letter of resignation framed in such terms which no one could question and which the Prime Minister could graciously accept with deep regret, etc, etc.\n\nSo Sir Keir has a choice. He can hold on to his Chancellor – as long as they can both keep smiling – or he can push her into resigning “for personal reasons”. My own guess is that she will stay for the moment but that, come the summer recess, all bets are off. There are a number of possible scenarios which I will list in descending order of likelihood.\n\nFirst:Rachel Reeves is removed as Chancellor but is given another big job in the Government which would require the removal of only one major figure (David Lammy?). Everybody else stays put. How this would be interpreted: Sir Keir does not want to look as if he has panicked and thrown all the cards into the air especially as Labour may be facing yet another threat from abreakaway Corbynite party on the hard Left– even though that outfit seems already to be splitting. Zarah Sultana’s unilateral announcement that she is to be its “joint leader” with Jeremy Corbyn appears to have come as something of a surprise to everybody else. At the time of writing, Mr Corbyn has only made an official comment which welcomes her to the project but does not acknowledge her “co-leadership”.\n\nEarlier, his comrades in the new venture were reported to be furious at her presumption. In the great tradition of Left-wing factionalism, the party has a schism even before it has a name.\n\nSecond:There is a minor reshuffle in which Ms Reeves moves to a big job (as above) and some more junior people who have been either lacklustre or embarrassing are removed altogether. This allows Sir Keir to proclaim a “refresh” of his team rather than a humiliating total rethink of the Government’s programme. But moving a few players around will have to be accompanied by some kind of coherent account of what his Government, and his party, are for and who they believe that they represent which is the real gaping hole in their credibility.\n\nThird:there is a major summer reshuffle which involves David Lammy, who is clearly out of his depth and Ed Miliband, who is clearly out of his mind, as well as Ms Reeves and possibly even Lord Hermer who is a close friend (and presumably a soul mate) of Sir Keir. Removing him as Attorney General would suggest ruthless desperation and a determined effort to transform the identity of the Government based on a recognition that its elevation of contentious international “human rights” priorities has been a massive domestic political misjudgement. In other words, an admission that Labour is seen to have abandoned the party’s core constituency.\n\nFourth:Nothing happens. Everybody stays where they are because Sir Keir does not want to raise fundamental questions about his Government’s purpose which he has never delineated. All that he promised in his election campaign was “change” without any account of what that might consist of, so there are no philosophical principles, or defining mission, to be judged by.This obstinate refusal to budge will be justified on the grounds that the Starmer government has always been confident in its grasp of reality. It will be framed as the grown up alternative to the populist threat from an economically naive Reform party and the new Corbyn tribe rooted in hard core ideology.\n\nIn truth, sticking to the original plan (whatever that was) will not be in the power of the Labour leadership. Many of the backbenchers who might have been expected to jump on to the Corbynista wagon appear to have decided instead to stick with Starmer’s party. Presumably, they would rather try to take over the steering wheel of the big bus than to run alongside it throwing stones at the driver.\n\nWhen you can influence – or undermine – the policy of a sitting government, whyjoin a fledgling protest group? And that will be the real story of the Labour government’s future: a constant struggle to hold power for no identifiable purpose.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

They then began climbing into the building’s silo to further access the fire.\n\n“Pretty much it’s a wood-structured building so it kinda took off from there,” Peterson said.\n\nThe fire then spread “real easily” through the top of the building’s silos, he said.\n\nThough firefighters were still working to save the concrete portion of the building, it looked like the silos were going to be a total loss, he added.\n\nWhen asked how old the building was, Peterson responded: “It’s old. Pretty old.”\n\nIt was as yet unclear what the cause of the fire was, he said, noting that investigators would hopefully be able to get camera footage from neighboring businesses to help determine how it started.\n\nAs of about 1:20 a.m., the flames no longer could be seen from the top of the building, though flickering could be seen deeper within the structures.\n\nPeterson said crews were likely to be at the scene until the “sun comes up.”\n\nUpdate, 1 a.m.:\n\nEverett Allred said he had finished watching fireworks when during a late-night walk, his brother saw the Templeton Feed & Grain building “go up in flames.”\n\nSo Allred hurried down to the scene to see what was happening.\n\n“At first it was only that top part, and then that slowly started spreading and collapsing,” he said motioning to the building’s tower. “I’m pretty sure it’s going to collapse tonight.”\n\nUpdate, 12:20 a.m.:\n\nFlames could be seen erupting from an upper area of Templeton Feed & Grain early Saturday morning as firefighters made a mad dash to save the building.\n\nThe towering flames could be seen as far away as Highway 101, as well as a large plume of dark smoke emanating from the building.\n\nAs of 12:20 a.m., numerous engines were working to try to douse the flames with water, though there appeared to be difficulty accessing the uppermost portion of the building where the flames were strongest.\n\nAs the blaze continued, a large group of onlookers gathered nearby.\n\nIn a post on X, Cal Fire said its crews were responding to the second-alarm fire as part of an automatic aid agreement with Templeton Fire.\n\nOther responding agencies were Atascadero, Paso Robles, San Miguel and San Luis Obispo city fire departments.\n\nPeople were asked to avoid the area as operations continued.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nAccording to emergency radio traffic, the fire was at 405 S.

    "News_title":"A fragile ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war tests the harmony of Los Angeles' huge Iranian community",
    "News_text":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Tehrangeles\" in West Los Angeles is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran.\n\nThis cultural enclave, also known as Little Persia, is where Iranian Muslims, Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians and Bahai have peacefully coexisted for decades.\n\nBut the recent war between Israel and Iran — a bloody, 12-day conflict paused by afragile ceasefire— has brought up religious tensions and political debates that rarely surface in this culturally harmonious environment. To complicate matters, the U.S. — an ally of Israel —bombed Iranduring the war.\n\nMany Iranian Jews in the diaspora have viewed the onset of the war with “anxious glee,” said Daniel Bral, a West Los Angeles resident whose grandfather, Moossa Bral, was the sole Jewish member of parliament in prerevolutionary Iran. He sees family members and others in the community rejoicing at the possibility of their “tormentor” being vanquished.\n\nBut Bral feels differently.\n\n“I’m just nervous and am completely rattled by everything that is happening,” he said. “I understand and sympathize with people’s hope for regime change. But I worry about the safety of civilians and the efficacy of the operation removing Iran as a nuclear threat.”\n\nBut Bral doesn’t see the war itself as a divisive issue in the diaspora because antagonism for the current regime is common across religious groups.\n\n“This hatred for the regime actually unifies Muslims and Jews,” he said.\n\nCultural enclave offers a sense of grounding\n\nKamran Afary, a professor of communication at California State University, Los Angeles, who emigrated from Iran in the 1970s and cowrote a book about identities in Iranian diaspora, said the community, for the most part, has nursed a spirit of tolerance and respect, much like his interfaith family. While Afary is spiritual but not religious, other members of his family practice Judaism, Islam and the Bahai faith.\n\n“Interfaith marriage used to be fraught, but even that is common now,” he said.\n\nAfary says for him, Tehrangeles, with its row of grocery stores, ice cream and kebab shops, restaurants, bakeries and bookstores, offers solace and a sense of grounding in his culture and roots. There are about half a million Iranian Americans in the Greater Los Angeles region.\n\nThe largest wave of Iranians migrated to the area after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in 1979 and Ayatollah Khomeini assumed control, establishing the Islamic Republic of Iran. West Los Angeles, in particular, has the largest concentration of Iranian Jews outside Iran.\n\nA test for long-held bonds\n\nDiane Winston, professor of media and religion at the University of Southern California, said Israel's recent fight against the regime in Iran could test relationships between Iranian Jews and Muslims.\n\n“Muslims, who otherwise would be happy to see regime change, might have felt a little differently about it because their antipathy for Zionism is strong,\" she said.\n\nWinston also observed that in the diaspora, which is concentrated in wealthy cities like Beverly Hills and Westwood, it is not just religion or culture that brings people together, but also their elevated social status.\n\n“They go to the same schools, parties and cultural events,” she said. “In general, Iranian Muslims and Jews are not quite as religious as their counterparts back home. Los Angeles is a city where there is room to be orthodox, but also being less religious is not a problem. The less religious Jews and Muslims are, the less antipathy they may have toward each other.”\n\nA time of fear and uncertainty\n\nTanaz Golshan was 2 when her family left Iran in 1986. She serves as the senior vice president of Caring for Jews in Need, the Jewish Federation Los Angeles’ service arm. She is also the organization’s liaison to the Iranian Jewish community.\n\nJudaism for Iranians is “more cultural and familial,” Golshan said. Getting together Friday for Shabbat means having Persian Jewish dishes like “gondi,” which are dumplings served in soup.\n\n“In my family, we didn’t grow up too religious,” she said. “We don’t think about religion when we go to a restaurant or market. You’ll find people in both communities that are extreme and don’t want anything to do with the other. But in general, we have a lot of love and respect for each other.”\n\nAnd yet this is proving to be a tense and scary time for Iranian Jews in the diaspora, she said.\n\n“What happens globally can affect security locally,” Golshan said, adding the federation's helpline has received calls asking if there are any threats to local Jewish institutions, she said. “There is real fear that temples and community centers could become targets.\"\n\nOn Monday, Golshan's organization and others hosted more than 350 community members for a virtual event titled, L.A. United: Iranian and Israeli Communities in Solidarity.\n\nA call for regime change in Iran\n\nReactions to the war have been nuanced, regardless of religious affiliations. Arezo Rashidian, whose family is Muslim, is a Southern California political activist who favors regime change in Iran. She supports the return ofReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the shah, who has declared he is ready to lead the country’s transition to a democratic government.\n\nRashidian said she has never been able to visit Iran because of her activism. The only hope for her return would be for the current regime to fall. This is why the ceasefire has stirred mixed feelings for her and many others in the community, she said.\n\n“It’s been an emotional roller coaster. No one wants a war, but we were on the brink of seeing this regime collapse. We were so close,\" she said.\n\nLior Sternfeld, professor of history and Jewish studies at Penn State University, said Iranian Jews in the diaspora identify with Iran, Israel and the U.S., and that these identities are “often not in harmony.”\n\n“They don’t see the Islamic Republic as Iran any more, but an entity to be demolished,\" he said. \"They see Israel more as a religious homeland.”\n\nPresident Donald Trumpenjoyed strong support in the diaspora and has now upset his backers in the community because he has stated he is not interested in regime change, Sternfeld said.\n\nDesire for unity and common ground\n\nThere is a push, particularly in the younger generation, for peace and understanding among religious groups in the diaspora.\n\nBral says he is engaged in peacebuilding work through his writing and advocacy. “We are cousins at the end of the day, as clichéd and corny as that sounds,” he said.\n\nBral's friend Rachel Sumekh, whose parents emigrated from Iran, grew up Jewish in the San Fernando Valley. Sumekh hosts dinner parties with her diverse group of friends as a way of widening her circle across religious lines.\n\nIn December, she hosted a gathering for Yalda, an ancient Persian festival with Zoroastrian roots, which is observed on the winter solstice as celebrants look forward to brighter days. Last year, Yalda, which also marks the victory of light over darkness, coincided with Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights.\n\n“We created a new tradition bringing people of both traditions together to emphasize how much we have in common,” Sumekh said. “This war is just a reminder that as much as our day-to-day lives may be separate, there is still a lot we share in terms of culture and as a people.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’scollaborationwith The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

    "News_title":"We Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Everyone Earned the Same Salary",
    "News_text":"In a world rife with income inequality, it’s hard not to dream of one where everyone earns the same salary — anincomethat is more than enough to survive on. Numerous factors make this unlikely, but as a thought experiment, we asked ChatGPT what would happen if such a thing were possible.\n\nFind Out:If Wealth Was Evenly Distributed Across America, How Much Money Would Every Person Have?\n\nRead Next:How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\n\nIf every American earned the same salary, how might the world as we know it change?Here’s what it said.\n\nThe immediate outcome is that income inequality “would plummet overnight, shrinking the gap between rich and poor,” ChatGPT said. Even better, poverty could be virtually eliminated in this country, meaning that access to basic needs, from housing to healthcare “might improve for low-income Americans.”\n\nOf course, people who had already accumulated wealth before such a theoretical change would still have more.\n\nExplore More:If Bezos’ Wealth Was Evenly Distributed Across the US, How Much Would We Get?\n\nHowever, there’s a downside, too, ChatGPT warned. People with “enough” income would then be empowered to shop more, which coulddrive up priceson the very essentials that everyone would now ostensibly be able to afford, causing inflation.\n\n“Simultaneously, luxury goods and markets driven by status or exclusivity could falter, because high earners no longer have more spending power,” ChatGPT wrote.\n\nThus, businesses might have to increase prices to offset higher payroll costs if everyone is paid more than before.\n\nChatGPT suggested that this would affect how people work, and whether they are motivated to, at all.\n\n“Highly skilled or demanding jobs (doctors, engineers, firefighters) might become harder to fill if they paid the same as low-skill jobs,” ChatGPT wrote. And “undesirable but necessary work” such as sanitation or eldercare, might be hard to find workers for, unless “non-monetary incentives (like status or reduced hours) were offered.”\n\nMotivation could all but ebb away in competitive or performance-based sectors like tech or finance, as well, since there would be less impetus to “earn more.”\n\nIf wages change, then the tax system would likely follow suit, ChatGPT suggested. “A flat wage would likely lead to a progressive wealth tax to address differences in assets,” it wrote, since income would no longer be an issue.\n\nThe government might also need to subsidize sectors that couldn’t survive with uniform wages, such as “small business or agriculture.”\n\nThe truth is, wealth inequality would still exist, because those who alreadyheld assets such as real estate, stocks or other wealth would continue to accrue greater value than the average person, “so the rich could stay rich, even without higher salaries,” ChatGPT wrote.\n\nInheritance and investment returns would likely become the new dominant sources of inequality.\n\nIdeally, in a world where everyone was less driven by larger incomes, social status would shift from money “to other metrics” such as “creativity, fame, education, influence.”\n\n“Occupational prestige might decline or flatten, since doctors and janitors would earn the same,” ChatGPT wrote.\n\nWhile this might allow some to pursue passions or public service, still others might feel disincentivized without financial upward mobility.\n\nChatGPT suggested that while the idea is “well-intentioned,” inequity would still exist and “pay parity without structural reforms to wealth, housing, education, and taxation could create as many problems as it solves.”\n\nThe economy as we know it — based on wage differentiation, competition and incentive — would need to be completely redesigned. That doesn’t sound like such a terrible thing in a country that is as wealthy and well-resourced as the U.S. is but still has many people going hungry and struggling to afford their most basic needs.\n\nUnsatisfied with this somewhat bleak picture ChatGPT painted, we asked it what it thought would make a better alternative than just salary equity.\n\nInstead of paying every American the same salary, a more equitable approach “would focus on leveling opportunity, not outcomes,” it wrote. This includesensuring a true living wagefor everyone, expanding access to healthcare and education, reforming the tax code to close loopholes and modestly tax extreme wealth, and creating pathways for economic mobility through homeownership and investment support.\n\nPhew. Just that, huh?\n\nChatGPT suggested that by rewarding socially essential work and giving all Americans the tools to build financial stability, “we can reduce inequality while still preserving motivation, innovation, and economic dynamism.”\n\nNow somebody ask Elon Musk if he’ll pay to make this happen.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nI'm a Realtor: This Is Why No One Wants To See Your Home\n\n3 Things Retirees Should Stop Buying To Save Money Amid Tariffs\n\n10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\n\n25 Places To Buy a Home If You Want It To Gain Value\n\nThis article originally appeared onGOBankingRates.com:We Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Everyone Earned the Same Salary",

    "News_title":"Trump and Netanyahu are heading for an Oval Office showdown",
    "News_text":"Bibi Netanyahu’s Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump on Monday could be a game-changer. They will undoubtedly focus on Iran, Gaza, and Syria’s new regime among other subjects. But how close are the two leaders’ positions, and can their differences be reconciled?\n\nBoth will declare the meeting “successful,” but the reality may be quite different. Trump crossed a Rubicon by ordering direct US militaryaction against nuclear-weapons-related targets in Iran. He may think the strikes were simply a “one and done” affair, but, if so, he is badly mistaken. Trump put his personal prestige on the line, not to mention America’s. Despite his contention that the B-2 bunker-buster raids “completely and totally obliterated” the targeted nuclear-program sites, much remains to be done.\n\nNo one knows that better than Netanyahu, who hasfocused on the Iranian nuclear threat for over three decades. Although he persuaded (or manoeuvred) Trump into using military force, the US President swerved immediately after receiving favourable reports on the strikes to impose a cease-fire on Israel and Iran.\n\nNetanyahu had little choice but to stand down, having achieved two major objectives: getting Trump into the fight andimposing significant, albeit not fatal, damage on Iran’s nuclear project. Iran also had little choice, having been pounded by Israel and the US, but to launch merely pro forma retaliation, shake its rhetorical fist in defiance, and hope to escape any additional destruction.\n\nNonetheless, Netanyahu sees that the time is ripe for further action against Iran, including actions to encourage the domestic opposition to move against the ayatollahs. Iran’s air defences are now essentially flat, but the moment will not last forever. Top Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists have been eliminated, but their ranks will reform, and their respective work will resume. The ayatollahs have clearly signalled their continuing resolve by effectively expelling all International Atomic Energy Agency personnel from the country.\n\nThe last thing Netanyahu wants is for Trump to throw Tehran an economic or political lifeline. Israel seeks regime change in Iran, and Netanyahu needs at least Trump’s acquiescence for Israel to continue deconstructing the remains of Iran’s nuclear enterprise. Further US participation would be icing on the cake. By contrast, Trump desperately wants a Nobel Peace Prize. After all, he reasons, Barack Obama received one (which he didn’t deserve), so why not Trump?\n\nTrump’s Nobel obsessionnow seems concentrated on Gaza, where the ongoing conflict has intensified since the Israel-Iran ceasefire took effect. He has pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach agreement to effect the return some still-unsettled number of Israeli hostages and remains, in exchange releasing possibly 1,000 Hamas prisoners in Israeli custody, plus a 60-day ceasefire. The sticking point remains Hamas’s insistence on a complete end to the war, or, reportedly, a commitment that talks to end the war commence immediately after the hostage\/prisoner exchanges.\n\nThis sort of framework has been used before, but its durability remains just as doubtful as other post-October 7, 2023 efforts. Trump wants to announce a cease-fire on or before the Monday meeting, but how long it lasts is anyone’s guess. Hamas undoubtedly wants relief from Israeli military strikes, and domestic political pressure to secure the release of more hostages has left Netanyahu little manoeuvring room. But, apart from humanitarian objectives regarding the hostages, Israel gains no strategic upside from yet another cease fire. Israel has repeatedly suspended combat operations and withdrawn from already-secured positions in Gaza, and then been forced to re-take them, at considerable human and material costs to the Israeli Defense Forces. Lengthening the war also imposes additional strains on an already stressed Israeli economy.\n\nThe collapse of Syria’s Assad regime, replaced by former Al-Nusra Front terrorists (now known as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, or “HTS”), was undoubtedly a serious setback for Iran. Acceding to Saudi Arabia’s requests, Trumplifted US economic sanctions previously imposed against Assad’s government, but substantial questions remain whether HTS has actually renounced terrorism.\n\nIts leader, Syria’s de facto head of government, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is also an unknown, having shed his combat fatigues for a suit, trimmed his beard, and dropped his nom de guerre for, apparently, his real name. In the meantime, Israel continues military operations inside Syria, in addition to holding onto an extended buffer zone occupied after Assad’s fall.\n\nPerhaps nothing concrete regarding Syria will emerge from the Netanyahu-Trump meeting, but the two leaders need a better sense of each other’s concerns and objectives. Since the First World War, the Middle East has seen more diplomatic efforts crash and burn than any other geographic hot spot. Iran and Gaza today are unlikely to prove more successful.\n\nMonday’s most important outcome in the West Wing will be decisions on the possible further use of US and Israeli military force to achieve key objectives on both fronts.\n\nJohn Bolton is a former US National Security Adviser\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Jobs in travel, retail and hospitality would evaporate as households juggled massive new fuel bills.\n\nNowimagine$20at the pump.\n\nEach penny increase in gas already costs U.S. consumers ~$1 billion annually. A jump to $20 would add over $5,000 in fuel costs per driver, and most families simply couldn’t absorb it.\n\nS. David Freeman, former head of the L.A. Board of Harbor Commissioners, wasn’t shywhen asked what $200-a-barrel oilwould mean for everyday Americans: “The purchasing power of the American people would be kicked in the teeth so darned hard… they won’t have the ability to buy much of anything.”\n\nOver time, necessity would require the economy to reorganize around high transportation costs.\n\nVehicle miles driven would drop and telecommuting would become the norm. Housing patterns would shift towards urban, transit-accessible areas. Freight routes would shorten, favoring local production. And GDP growth would likely fall well below trend until EVs, public transit and renewable infrastructure catch up.\n\nThe auto industry would have to change dramatically.\n\nInternal combustion (gas) vehicle sales would collapse, and EV and hybrid demand would surge. In California, EV sales respond4-6 times more to gas pricehikes than electricity price changes.\n\nLegacy automakers would also face severe financial strain as plants focused on large vehicles would shutter, while battery and EV assembly lines race to keep up. In turn, supply chains for batteries and rare minerals would most certainly bottleneck.\n\nFreight companies would pass on fuel surcharges or cut routes. Ocean shipping increases would be comparable to a 15% tariff on imports and global supply chains would shrink.\n\nJet fuel costs would ground flights and raise fares which would mean routes would be slashed and air travel demand would collapse.\n\nOn the ground, public transit ridership from buses to trains, would soar.\n\nWith household budgets gutted, non-essentials would suffer. Consumer spending would tank, and small businesses would eventually close.\n\nFarmers would face skyrocketing diesel and fertilizer prices. Food costs would rise sharply, worsening inflation.\n\nTax holidays, SPR releases or gas rebates would offer only minor relief. Long-term, you could expect big public spending on EV tax credits, electric buses, transit infrastructure and renewable energy. Governments might ease drilling rules but also ramp up conservation campaigns and fuel efficiency mandates.\n\nHigh gas prices in the U.S. would also have a ripple effect globally.\n\nOil exporters would enjoy windfall profits, while import-dependent countries face inflation, trade deficits and slower growth. Shipping costs would spike, food insecurity would worsen and pressure to decarbonize would intensify worldwide.\n\nIf gas prices were ever to jump to such a high amount, the impact would be detrimental to the U.S. and global economies. As industries are forced to pivot shipping and manufacturing processes, the cost of goods would jump wildly across the board making even the most basic necessities unaffordable to most people.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nI'm a Realtor: This Is Why No One Wants To See Your Home\n\n3 Things Retirees Should Stop Buying To Save Money Amid Tariffs\n\nHere's the Minimum Salary Required To Be Considered Upper Class in 2025\n\n4 Affordable Car Brands You Won't Regret Buying in 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared onGOBankingRates.com:What If the Cost of Gas Went Up to $20 per Gallon?",

    "News_title":"Opinion - Out of sight, out of mind: Without federal support, brain injury survivors will be left behind",
    "News_text":"Unlike a broken bone, a brain injury is often invisible.\n\nWe can’t see the cognitive struggles, the lost memories or the chronic pain. But for millions of Americans with brain injury, the impact is lifelong and profound. Every day is an exercise in rebuilding your life, your relationships and future.\n\nFederal programs have made the journey of life with brain injury a bit more manageable. But now, that support is under serious threat.\n\nBudget proposals and the Office of Management and Budget’sleaked passback documentoutline catastrophic cuts to health programs across the board. Among them: the elimination of nearly every federal initiative supporting people with brain injuries.\n\nDecades of investment in prevention and treatment could vanish with the stroke of a pen. These programs aren’t wasteful spending. They are an important investment for people living with brain injury — now and in the future.\n\nThese proposed cuts would dismantle the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s HEADS UP program, which trains coaches, parents and athletes to recognize concussions before they cause permanent damage. They would collapse the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems, the nation’s gold standard for providing care and advancing recovery for survivors with moderate to severe brain injuries. We would also lose the National Concussion Surveillance System and end the collection of critical data showing where injuries are happening and how many lives are at risk.\n\nFunding cuts for these programs put all of us at risk. Funding cuts mean a teenage football player sustains a preventable second concussion because his school had no access to proper return-to-play guidelines. A veteran with a blast injury loses access to a rehabilitation specialist trained to address cognitive impairments. Families already stretched thin by caregiving responsibilities lose the tiny but crucial grants that kept their loved ones living independently at home.\n\nBrain injury does not just happen to “other people.” More than64 million Americanshave sustained at least one traumatic brain injury (TBI) in their lifetime and millions have suffered from non-traumatic brain injuries like stroke, aneurysm or a lack of oxygen.\n\nFederal investment in brain injury research and care is modest. In 2024,TBI research funding was an estimated $194 million, which is just $3.03 per person living with a TBI — barely the cost of a cup of coffee. That figure pales in comparison to the estimated $76.5 billion annual cost of TBI in the United States for emergency care, hospitalization, lost productivity, disability and social services.\n\nCutting these programs isn’t fiscal responsibility. It’s public health malpractice.\n\nEliminating programs like HEADS UP, the National Concussion Surveillance System and the Core State Injury Prevention Program will roll back decades of progress. These cuts will create a world where more people are suffering from the effects of brain injury, and we will have a lessened ability to identify and help those in need. It is not realistic to assume that states will be able to pick up the cost of these programs, so many will likely go away with no backup plan for continuity.\n\nThis should not be a political issue.\n\nFor decades, programs that support brain injury prevention, research and treatment have received bipartisan support because the need for them is undeniable. Brain injuries don’t discriminate by party, race, income or geography. Brain injury can strike suddenly — a slip on the ice, a collision on the field, a car crash, a roadside bomb in combat — and alter lives forever.\n\nBrain injury should be thought of as a chronic health condition. Many survivors struggle with persistent effects such as memory loss, depression, behavioral changes and physical disabilities, which can quietly erode their ability to work, study or maintain relationships. Worse, brain injury dramatically increases the risk of developing devastating conditions later in life, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and stroke.\n\nWithout continued research, education and community-based supports, many survivors will simply fall through the cracks. Eliminating federal brain injury programs would worsen these public health crises while stripping hope from those who need it most.\n\nThe Brain Injury Association of America calls on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. We urge Congress to reject these devastating cuts to brain injury programs.\n\nInvesting in brain injury services and research saves lives, saves money and upholds America’s promise to care for its most vulnerable citizens. America made that promise decades ago, when it began building the vital network of programs that exist today. That promise must not be broken now. Not when so many lives and futures depend on it.\n\nRick Willis is president and CEO of the Brain Injury Association of America.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_title":"Fire devastates historic Templeton Feed & Grain building as town watches",
    "News_text":"A massive fire that sparked late on the Fourth of July devastated the historic Templeton Feed & Grain building, sending towering flames shooting into the sky for hours as residents gathered on street corners to watch.\n\nFirefighters were still dousing flames throughout Saturday as much of the roof of the 80-foot granary tower collapsed. Crews were able to save the original concrete structure, which dates back more than 100 years.\n\nEngines from across the county responded to the blaze as firefighters attacked the flames from multiple angles, blasting water through windows and the fully engulfed structure.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the iconic building was a smoking ruin, and spectators and residents watched as firefighters continued treating the flames.\n\nOne of those was Andrea Neider, who has worked for the granary for four months. She moved to Templeton two years ago.\n\nNeider said they’re in “limbo” waiting for the fire to be put out, as well as to hear an assessment about the future of the business.\n\n“We’re down but not out,” Neider said.\n\nRay Pesenti Jr., a lifelong Templeton resident, said his father helped build the granary in the 1940s. Pesenti first heard about the fire Saturday morning.\n\nLive updates: Flames engulf iconic Templeton Feed & Grain towers in late-night fire\n\nLou Esposito, a Templeton resident, suspected that Fourth of July fireworks may have contributed to the burn.\n\n“There was fireworks that the city allows, and we suspect that it was a rogue rocket that smoldered up there,” Esposito said. “I mean Fourth of July and (the granary) burns at night, you kidding me? It had to be a rocket.”\n\nFirefighting was expected “to continue for several days,” the Templeton Fire Department said in a news release Saturday afternoon.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Templeton residents were urged to conserve water due to the amount it took to fight the fire overnight.\n\nIn apost on X on Saturday morning, the Templeton Fire Department asked residents to “limit indoor water use and do not water at all outdoors at this time.”\n\n“Templeton is at critically low water levels due to the amount of water used to contain the fire at Templeton Feed and Grain,” the post read.\n\nTempleton Feed & Grain has long been a San Luis Obispo County institution, with its iconic 80-foot grain elevator and grain silos standing proudly above Templeton’s Main Street for decades.\n\nThe original concrete building was built in 1912 and was used as a garage for Chevrolet vehicles and Illinois tractors, according to theTempleton Area Expansion Plan.It was converted to a granary in the 1930s.\n\nLater, the towering structure that looms over South Main Street was added, giving the downtown its well-known look.\n\nThe building is located between 4th and 5th streets across from McPhee’s Grill.\n\nIn an interview with The Tribune at around 1 a.m.., Templeton Fire Chief Tom Peterson said the agency was initially notified of a fire alarm at the building at 11:11 p.m. Friday.\n\nThe first unit on scene saw smoke and requested a full structure response, he said. They then began climbing into the building’s silo to further access the fire.\n\n“Pretty much it’s a wood-structured building so it kinda took off from there,” Peterson said.\n\nThe fire then spread “real easily” through the top of the building’s silos, he said.\n\nThough firefighters were still working to save the concrete portion of the building, it looked like the silos were going to be a total loss, he added.\n\nWhen asked how old the building was, Peterson responded: “It’s old. Pretty old.”\n\nIt was as yet unclear what the cause of the fire was, he said, noting that investigators would hopefully be able to get camera footage from neighboring businesses to help determine how it started.\n\nAs of about 1:20 a.m., the flames no longer could be seen from the top of the building, though flickering could be seen deeper within the structures.\n\nThe flames had worked down from the room all the way to the ground. They could be seen raging in the warehouse through an open door along South Main Street.\n\nPeterson said crews were likely to be at the scene until the “sun comes up.”\n\nThe fire erupted as residents were wrapping a day of Fourth of July celebrations in the North County town, which also hosted a parade earlier in the day.\n\nStreets that were lined with American flags and filled with festivities were reduced to a community tragedy 12 hours later.\n\nEverett Allred, who was watching the firefight from a nearby streetcorner, said he had just finished watching fireworks when during a late-night walk, his brother saw the Templeton Feed & Grain building “go up in flames.”\n\nSo Allred hurried down to the scene to see what was happening.\n\n“At first it was only that top part, and then that slowly started spreading and collapsing,” he said motioning to the building’s tower. “I’m pretty sure it’s going to collapse tonight.”\n\nAt around midnight, flames could be seen erupting from the top of the building as firefighters on tall ladders made a valiant effort to save the historic structure.\n\nThe towering flames could be seen as far away as Highway 101, as a large plume of dark smoke poured from the top of the building.\n\nAs of 12:20 a.m., numerous engines were working to try to douse the flames with water, though they had difficulty accessing the uppermost portion of the building where the flames were strongest.\n\nIn a post on X, Cal Fire said its crews were responding to the second-alarm fire as part of an automatic aid agreement with Templeton Fire.\n\nOther responding agencies were Atascadero, Paso Robles, San Miguel and San Luis Obispo city fire departments.\n\nPeople were asked to avoid the area as operations continued.",

    "News_title":"High-profile sex criminals could be granted trial without jury",
    "News_text":"High-profile suspects in sex cases that have shocked the nation could get the right toseek a trial without a juryunder plans to be considered by ministers.\n\nA review commissioned by Shabana Mahmood, the Justice Secretary, is expected this week to recommend defendants should get the right to ask for a judge-only trial as part of “once-in-a-generation” reforms to tacklechronic court backlogs.\n\nSir Brian Leveson, the review’s author and a former Appeal Court judge, has suggested that this could include suspects whose crimes have garnered so much “public opprobrium” that they might feel the suspect would be unlikely to get an “objective” trial by jury.\n\nIn a previous review, he indicated this reform could include defendants charged with sexual or sadistically violent offences, or suspects from minorities or sects who might consider a judge to be more objective than a jury.\n\nThe move to give a right to opt for a judge-only trial would replicate similar systems in the US and Canada, where defendants in all Crown Court trials have the right to refuse a jury. An alternative model in New Zealand limits the option to less serious offences carrying maximum sentences below 14 years in jail.\n\nSir Brian signalled the approach last month in a speech to legal experts, although he stressed a judge would require the discretion to reject any request.\n\n“I’m also going to talk about the extent to which a defendant should be allowed to elect to be tried by a judge alone, as happens in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand,” he said.\n\nHis review aims to tackle the recordCrown Court backlog of 77,000 cases, which forces some victims to wait until 2029 for a suspect to be brought before a court. Sir Brian warned criminal justice was at “risk of collapse” and gave defendants the chance to exploit the delays to plead not guilty in the hope their victims give up or forget vital evidence.\n\nAs previously revealed by The Telegraph, he will propose a new intermediate court made up of a judge and two magistrates to hear cases that would have previously gone before a jury in the Crown Court. He will recommend complex cases that may last a year or more such as fraud and cyber crime should be considered only by a judge.\n\nMagistrates will be given more powers to hear more offences where previously a defendant could have elected a jury trial. At present, they can only try offences with a maximum sentence of one year but this could be increased to two years.\n\nMinisters are expected to draw the boundaries on which offences will be heard in the three courts later this year but Sir Brian is understood to have argued for a radical approach that would even see defendants who are charged with assault causing actual bodily harm denied a jury trial.\n\nThe reform would mean thousands of suspects would no longer have the right to put their case to a jury of their peers in offences such as assault of a police officer while resisting arrest, racially aggravated criminal damage, dangerous driving and possessing a class-C drug like cannabis.\n\nSir Brian previously floated the idea of allowing defendants to request a judge-only trial in an efficiency review in 2015 where he said it would be “simpler, speedier and cheaper” than a jury hearing.\n\nHe said it could be an attractive option to “defendants who are charged with offences that attract particular public opprobrium, such as sexual\/sadistic violence, or from minorities or sects who may consider the judge to be a more objective tribunal than a jury”.\n\nThe proposed reform could also appeal to defendants in “factually or legally extremely complex” cases, or where there was “publicity adverse to the defence”, or where defendants’ cases turned on alleged confessions or identification in which judges could be more “rigorous in the weight afforded” to such evidence than juries.\n\nSpeaking last month, Sir Brian said the right to opt out of a jury trial would have to be considered on a case-by-case basis with judges given discretion to decide.\n\n“There are some cases, which I would not consider appropriate for a judge to try alone, and I would give the judge a discretion. So a defendant may say, ‘I would like to be tried by a judge alone”, and the judge would be perfectly entitled to say, ‘I think not’,” he said.\n\n“I can also see lots of examples. I can see defendants, perhaps charged with cases that attract public opprobrium being concerned about a jury coming in from their daily lives to face that trial.\n\n“Equally, I can see if it’s that much public opprobrium why a judge may say, ‘I’m not sure about that’.

    "News_title":"Can tribal leaders in Hebron bring peace with Israel?",
    "News_text":"The fact that the Sons of Iraq or the leaders of Jordan and Iraq emerged under US and British support, illustrate that these tribal structures often require outside support.\n\nA recent article atThe Jerusalem Postspeaks about meeting with the topHebron sheikhwho wants to pull out of Palestinian Authority. The article claims that Sheikh Wadee’ al-Jaabari is the leader ofHebron’s most influential clan. Now “and four other leading Hebron sheikhs have signed a letter pledging peace and full recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.”\n\nA letter has even been drafted. Jaabari has reached out to Israeli officials, the report says. Eight sheikhs are “believed to lead 204,000 local residents.”\n\nThere is an enduring allure of sheikhs and clans being able to offer a new initiative in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Gaza there has been talk since October 7 thatclans and tribes might emerge to challenge Hamas. So far they have not emerged. In their place a few militias apparently have been backed by Israel.\n\nWhat is interesting about the narrative of sheikhs, tribes and clans being able to rise up as peace partners is that this narrative still exists in 2025. More than 100 years ago the British allied with Arab tribes during the Arab revolt against the Ottomans.\n\nAt the time the British officer T.E Lawrence had journeyed from Egypt to meet with Sharif Hussein bin Ali, a leader of a tribe and also the Sharif and Emir of Mecca. With his sons, Ali, Abdullah and Faisal, the Sharif led a revolt against the Ottomans with British help.\n\nWe know what became of this revolt and its mixed legacy. Abdullah became the king of what is now Jordan and his descendants still rule the country. However, Abdullah’s decision to intervene in 1948 during the Israeli war of independence eventually led to his assassination in Jerusalem in 1951 at the hands of a Palestinian Arab.\n\nAli became the king of the Hejaz but was expelled by the Saudis in the 1920s and he died in Iraq. Faisal briefly sought to become king of Syria in 1920 but he was expelled by the French and ended up in Iraq. He ruled as king of Iraq from 1921 until his death in 1933. His grandson was overthrown and killed in 1958.\n\nThe false hope of sheikhs and clans can be seen in the mixed legacy of the Arab revolt. This was not just a group of sheikhs, tribes or clans. It was an important group with a long legacy and powerful history. However, even with this historic Islamic ties and their base of support in the Hejaz, they didn’t fare that well when they tried to move outside their realm. They survived in Jordan primarily because the Kingdom of Jordan in the 1920s was partly a tribal society.\n\nThey were able to balance that with British military support even when the Kingdom became home to large numbers of people fleeing the 1948 war. As such, Jordan became demographically more Palestinian than Jordanian over time. Is it correct to call Jordan a successful “tribal” state run by “sheikhs” and “clans.”\n\nThere is no doubt that was the initial binding element, but it survives because the king was able to move beyond that. The Kingdom worked with Circassian minorities, Christians, Palestinians and the clans of northern Jordan to create a state. It faced huge challenges, including the possibility of a Nasser inspired rebellion, a civil war in the 1970s and even plots from Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe end of the other tribal initiatives that grew out of the Arab Revolt illustrate how “tribes” and “sheikhs” cannot generally govern successfully in larger states that are urbanized. This doesn’t mean they can never succeed. People point to the Gulf states as examples of tribal and sheikh success.\n\nHowever, those states are relatively small and they began primarily as British protectorates. The local sheikhs were able to first receive a stable small state and then grow it over time. They never had to rule over other urban elites, as they grew their state around a tribal structure.\n\nAnother place that people point to the success of “clans” and “sheikhs” is in the Arab Awakening movement in Iraq, also known as the Sons of Iraq or Sahwah. This group of Sunni tribal leaders emerged for only a short period of time between 2006 and 2008 mostly, to help secure a part of Iraq during a time of uncertainty and insurgency against US rule in the country. However, what was the legacy of this initiative? It had no real staying power and didn’t really govern or project stability. In essence, it was a short success during a period of chaos.\n\nThere are many other examples people will point to in order to show how tribes, clans and sheikhs are part of the fabric of the region, and a type of structure that might be relied on. However, evidence shows that generally the tribes and clans in the region can only be counted on to provide limited stability in small regions, usually when government institutions break down. The Shammar tribe in Iraq and Syria, for instance, may be a large tribal structure and it may be important. However, its relevance doesn’t extend to running either country.\n\nSome people make a simplistic argument that the Middle East is basically a collection of “tribes” and that there are no real “states.” They argue that the weaker and “failed” states all exist because they do not reflect the underlying “tribes.” In this narrative, the current successful Arab countries of the Gulf are successfuly because they are rooted in tribes; and the apparent weakness of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries is because the “tribes” have not been invested in enough. This understanding of the region lacks a real appreciation of the diversity of the Middle East.\n\nWhile it may be true that tribal structures are important in some areas, the fact is that the modern urbanized Middle East has had the same affect that urbanization has had on people all over the world; reducing clan and tribal structures and moving people in masses to cities. When people become educated and there are institutions, tribal structures begin to fray. Arab nationalism, for instance, weakened these structures. No one can seriously argue that Egypt, a state rooted in the power of the people of the Nile valley, is really a “tribal” state. It exists in opposition largely to “tribes.” Lebanon, because it is such a diverse state, is not best divided into “tribes.” Syria is also a diverse state and is not best seen as a “tribal” state. One may argue that many parts of Iraq have strong tribal elements. There are Kurdish tribes, Yazidi tribes, and Sunni tribes. However, the power of these various groups within larger groups has largely persisted because Iraq has been in such chaos over the years; from the Saddam era to the insurgency and the ISIS war.\n\nNow, let’s return to the Palestinian Arabs and the false hope of tribes. The growth of Fatah in the 1960s and 1970s and then Hamas in the 1980s is largely in opposition to tradition tribal or clan elements in society. After the 1948 war the collapse of Palestinian Arab society, due to massive movement of refugees and displaced people, meant that traditional village and beduin sheikh rule broke down; along with the traditional urban elites and “effendis.” There was a brief period where traditional rulers re-emerged in the 1950s. Nationalism pushed them to the side, as did Arab socialism and communism and eventually the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nWhy would tribal and clan structures re-emerge after so many decades of being weakened? They might be tapped on a very local level, but the idea that they might command the allegiance of hundreds of thousands appears mistaken. Tribal sheikhs can’t run schools or institutions, they don’t run universities, or hospitals. If an “emirate” emerges in Hebron what land will it control. Will it be armed? Who will administer education and universities and colleges in the area? Who will build wells and pave roads? The Gulf states only work because the traditional tribal structure took on the responsibility of governance.\n\nHowever, there’s no evidence that this is happening among clans in Hebron or Gaza. The fact that the Sons of Iraq or the leaders of Jordan and Iraq emerged under US and British support, illustrate that these tribal structures often require outside support. They feed off weak states but they rarely replace states, especially when they are foised on existing urban and rural structures.",

Most of the leadership, about 95%, are now dead,” the Hamas official told the BBC.\"\n\nHamashas reportedly lost about 80% of its control over Gaza, a senior official from the terrorist organization told the BBC.\n\nThe official explained that Hamas’s command and control infrastructure had collapsed after months of Israeli airstrikes, which wiped out its political, military, and security leadership.\n\n“Let’s be realistic here – there’s barely anything left of the security structure. Most of the leadership, about 95%, are now dead... Theactive figures have all been killed,” he said in the interview published Sunday.\n\n“Logically, it has to continue until the end,” the Hamas official said. “All the conditions are aligned: Israel has the upper hand, the world is silent, the Arab regimes are silent, criminal gangs are everywhere, and society is collapsing.\n\n“Let me be clear: the security situation has completely collapsed. There is no control anywhere.\n\n“So, the security situation is zero. Hamas’s control is zero. There’s no leadership, no command, no communication. Salaries are delayed, and when they arrive, they are barely usable. Some die just trying to collect them. It’s total collapse.”\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he and US President Donald Trump are determined to eliminate Hamas’s military capabilities, in addition to bringing the hostages home.\n\n“We are still focused on the Gaza arena. We have also achieved great successes there, but there are still tasks to complete,” Netanyahu stated prior to his visit to Washington.\n\n“We are also determined to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel. This means we will not allow a situation where there are more kidnappings, more killings, more beheadings, or more invasions. This means one thing: the destruction of Hamas’s military and governmental capabilities. Hamas will not be there.”\n\nIn June, IDF Spokesperson Brig.-Gen. Effie Defrin stated thatHamas’s grip on Gaza was weakeningas Israeli forces continued operations both above and below ground,The Jerusalem Postreported.\n\n“Hamas is losing control. It continues to operate against its own civilians,” Defrin stated. He said the “distribution of food severely harms Hamas and its rule. Tens of thousands of meals are distributed daily to Gazans.”\n\nThe IDF has recently been operating nearGaza Humanitarian Foundationfood distribution sites in southern Gaza to prevent Hamas terrorists and local clans from taking control of the food, thereby allowing Palestinian civilians to safely receive aid.",

    "News_title":"20 years on, the terrorist threat is as great as ever",
    "News_text":"On July 6 2005, I joined colleagues on the balcony of our office building overlooking St James’s Park to see the Red Arrows streak past in a trail of red, white and blue in celebration of London’s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics. Less than 24 hours later, a parallel universeenveloped the capital in a sea of blood and chaos. In the two decades since that day of infamy, how has the threat of violent extremism changed? Are we now equal to its challenge?\n\nThe suicide bombers who caused carnage on public transport above and beneath the streets of London were actingin the name of al-Qaeda (AQ), the dominant Islamist terror franchise of the day. Fifty-two people were murdered and 700 injured in a co-ordinated attack involving four bombs packed with shrapnel, detonated at four locations. The logistics involved and the prior movements of two of the bombers suggest a high degree of training most experts agree was enabled by senior AQ assets in Pakistan. The motivation for the attack was to influence British foreign policy to force a withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe threat we face two decades on has arguably mutated to something even greater. Organised group attacks can be devastating but they are also relatively easy to detect. Another co-ordinated bomb attack narrowly failed on July 21 that year, with heightened panic leading to thetragic death of innocent Jean Charles de Menezes. Public co-operation led to the perpetrators being swiftly arrested. Two other multi-handed plots in 2006 and 2007 were successfully stopped.\n\nThe next decade saw the terrorist threat from Islamists mutate from one with an ostensible foreign policy objective and external support to home-grown radicalised terrorists acting for Islamic State (IS) whose objectives were global jihad and the creation of a worldwide Caliphate. Attacks became more frequent and less sophisticated. Many more of the perpetrators involved had criminal backgrounds and psychological impairments. Ideological strikes in iconic locations by dedicated groups had devolved into lone actor attacks using vehicles and knives involving deeply inadequate perpetrators animated by online grievance and conspiracy theories.\n\nWhile the attacks and plots of 7\/7 and those intercepted afterwards always had murder in mind, there was at least some recognisable rationale behind the attacks. Today’s Islamist extremist is motivated only by how high he can make the body count before being martyred in a “divine” cause.\n\nAlthought the vast majority of terrorist attacks since 7\/7 have been carried out by Islamists and they remain the overwhelming threat to our security, the extreme Right has been growing in potency. However, the state’s cack-handed and plainly ludicrous insistence that the risks posed by these groups is somehow equivalent to Islamist terror plays into the very grievance narratives that fuels a broader and more complex challenge than was the case in 2005.\n\nWe now have a networked and “always on” terrorist threat enabled and amplified by online communication still in infancy at the time of 7\/7. The internet connects, inspires and mobilises today’s lone actor terrorist. Moreover, the West has seen a collapse in morale and collective identity in part resulting from the stealthy infiltration of the state and its organs by Islamist-adjacent groups and supporters. Don’t take my word for it.Hizb ut-Tahrir (HbT), a hugely influential global Islamist organisation, has a three-stage strategy to establish a caliphate, including penetration into government positions and military special forces to build public opinion. HbT was proscribed here in January 2024 because of the violent anti-Semitism it stirred up in the wake of the October 7 massacre.\n\nToday’s terrorist threat is more diverse and unpredictable than in 2005. Our resilience against violent extremism is hollowed out by institutional timidity. We still face tactical, technical and operational obstacles hampering disaster response. While Islamist extremism is supported by a tiny fraction of Muslims, virulent anti-Semitism has taken hold within and animates hatreds, the precursor for domestic terrorism, from events thousands of miles away. These challenges require a strong response, putting country before political calculation or progressive distractions.\n\nIn remembering the innocent lives sundered by terrorists on that awful July day, two decades on, we owe their brutally foreshortened lives a debt that is far from being repaid.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Left-wing purity tests are robbing Britain of its arts and culture",
    "News_text":"In a few weeks Scotland’s capital city will turn into a metropolis of storytelling and comedy as the world’s biggest performing arts festival, the Edinburgh Fringe, kicks off for the 78th year.\n\nIts existence should not go unappreciated – as society grows more divided and people are sucked into their own online worlds, communal events like this are needed more than ever. This isn’t just about rich kids cracking jokes – a good performance gives its audience a new perspective and a fresh way of thinking. The most original shows I’ve seen have been at the Fringe.\n\nOf course, originality comes at a price. It may not be poetic to talk about money but it is important. Arts events like the Fringe rely on a mish-mash of state support, ticket sales, corporate cash and philanthropic donations. In other words, arts funding is finely balanced. Pull out one part and it can all come crashing down like a Jenga tower.\n\nWe are seeing this play out at some festivals this summer, including the Fringe’s parent event, the Edinburgh International Festival.\n\nFrancesca Hegyi, the boss of the Edinburgh International Festival, said over the weekend that the loss of corporate sponsorship meant it had to slash the number of shows it was putting on by a fifth this summer.\n\nThere has been a “wholesale collapse of arts sponsorships,”she told the Financial Times, explaining there was a “reticence” among businesses to donate after the rise of activists targeting arts donors. The message comes a month after major museums called for an end to the “relentless negativity” around private cash in the arts.\n\nEdinburgh was the subject of a public campaign last year to cut ties withBaillie Gifford, an investment giant targeted because of its small investments in fossil fuel companies and alleged links to Israeli defence via its investments in tech giants such as Amazon and Meta, companies whose products many protesters themselves are likely to use.\n\nThe festival ultimately yielded and cut ties with Baillie Gifford.\n\nIn the wake of such pressure, other businesses are questioning whether they would pass the new purity tests of the activists. As a result nobody wants to step in and pick up the cheque.\n\nIt is absolutely right for climate and human rights campaigners to hold companies to account – corrupt businesses eager to polish their image by “art washing” should be called out – but there needs to be some reasonableness and sense of proportionality.\n\nBoycotting art sponsors that have small investments in companies on the fringes of issues will do little to help the wider cause. All that will happen is the arts will suffer, not the fossil fuel companies or tech giants in question.\n\nWe will all be left culturally poorer as a result. Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, warned earlier this year of a “moral puritanism” sweeping through the arts that risked gagging society.\n\nThe Fringe, which is funded in a different way to its parent festival, is still accepting cash from Baillie Gifford. Benny Higgins, the Fringe’s chairman, says the board “make careful judgments about what’s acceptable” when it comes to sponsors.\n\nBut if you can’t take money from Baillie Gifford – a Scottish investment giant that creates jobs in the area and which is best known for investing in technology – then “I’m not sure you can take money from any corporate”, he says.\n\nThat’s a concern, given that the Fringe itself is currently on the hunt for a replacement for its former key sponsor Johnny Walker.\n\nBaillie Gifford insists it has been unfairly targeted. The fund manager says less than 2pc of its assets are invested in companies that work in oil and gas, which is below the industry average of 9.5pc. It invests significantly more in green energy.\n\nIts links to Israel, meanwhile, are through investments in tech giants that work there – hardly a full-throated backing for the country.\n\nBaillie Gifford argues that demanding divestment on such grounds is unreasonable “much as it would be unreasonable to demand authors boycott Instagram or stop selling books on Amazon”. Nick Thomas, a partner at the investment company, said suggestions from some campaigners that it had significant money in the occupied Palestinian territories was “offensively misleading”.\n\nWhile the argument rages, corporate sponsors are retreating. Major companies do not want to get caught in a row over the environment, Israel or other contested issues, and so would rather sit on the sidelines.\n\nUltimately, this will mean less art, culture and music. Ticket prices will be higher. More people will be excluded (the Fringe is already criticised as elitist because of exorbitant accommodation prices) and important, thought-provoking pieces from marginalised groups will never get made. Less money simply equals less access, less experimentation and less creativity. Minds will become smaller.\n\nThe economy will also suffer. These big events can generate hundreds of millions of pounds a year for local economies.\n\nTake The Hay literature festival, for example. It was founded in 1987 around a kitchen table and today brings in tens of millions every year to the Welsh town of Hay-on-Wye. The event was described by former US President Bill Clinton as the “Woodstock of the mind”. Its sponsorship deal with Baillie Gifford also ended last year following protests.\n\nThe argument here isn’t that campaigners and artists should roll over and not hold companies to account. Calling for museums to ensure their sponsors meet certain environmental criteria, for example, seems sensible. But activists need to rethink their tactics and the threshold at which they act.\n\nThis summer art chiefs will rightly call out boycotts which they think are unreasonable. The problem is it could already be too late.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"If We Don’t Stand With Ukraine, What Do We Stand For?",
    "News_text":"ON JULY 1, THE PENTAGON REPORTEDLYcanceled a shipmentof weapons for Ukraine, including artillery ammunition, rockets for the HIMARS system, weapons to shoot down Russian airplanes and helicopters, and, most crucial of all, PATRIOT interceptors that can protect Ukrainian civilians against missile attacks.\n\nAs is becoming a pattern, the process behind the decision was possibly even worse that the outcome. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reportedly made this decisionunilaterally. A White House spokesperson defended the decision by saying that “This decision was made to put America’s interests first following a DOD review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,” and added, as a misdirection, “The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned—just ask Iran.” According to NBC, Secretary Hegseth reportedly decided to withhold the weapons after “senior military officers found that the aid packagewould notjeopardize the American military’s own ammunition supplies.”\n\nThe decision not to send the weapons was apparently made without consulting the Ukrainians, our NATO allies, Congress, or even the State Department.\n\nHegseth, of course, has the power to overrule any officer at any time, as long as his orders are legal. But what this order reveals about Hegseth’s policy—or, considering the lack of process, it might be more accurate to call it his “political instincts”—is infuriating.\n\nHere’s theBulwarkpromise: We tell you what we really think. No spin. No tribal allegiances. We’re not just a publication; we’re a community. Join us.\n\nIN HIS FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS, President Dwight D. Eisenhower—who forgot more about defense policy and politics than most of us will ever know—warnedthat “history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.” Seventy-three years later, his warning still rings true, as the United States confronts a series of tests not just on our own shores, but also on the battlefields of Ukraine. Under question are our national will, our clarity of purpose, the credibility of U.S. leadership, and the understanding that other freedom-loving nations depend on us for support and example, and that we depend on other freedom-loving nations for our own security and prosperity.\n\nIn the most precarious phase of Russia’s war against Ukraine since 2022, we are on the precipice of failure.\n\nRussia, despite a rickety economy and unsustainable manpower losses, is escalating this fight in an attempt to win through diplomacy—pouring everything into a renewed effort to break the West’s resolve because they can’t break Ukraine’s lines. And Ukraine continues to hold at great cost. If we falter now, the United States risks more than just a battlefield setback. We risk sending a signal to adversaries and allies alike that America no longer has the stomach to stand with those who fight for freedom. To give up now sends the message that we have no will to commit to our own national interests.\n\nThe history of diplomacy has many euphemisms for disengaging from a fight before the enemy: “ending wars,” “retrenchment,” “refocusing,” “a decent interval,” and so on. The military has a simple word for it: surrender.\n\nThe past three U.S. administrations understood both the stakes and the complexity of supporting Ukraine. They helped Ukraine take the difficult steps toward interoperability with NATO while provided critical military equipment and training. Our policy and our delivery timelines weren’t always perfect, but Republicans and Democrats agreed that a free, strong Ukraine in a position to defend itself was an asset to our security. And Americans supported that approach.\n\nNone of this was charity—it was strategic investment with deliberate attention to what we could provide without compromising our own readiness. That took rigor, discipline, analysis, and more risk mitigation than almost anyone who doesn’t work in the Pentagon will ever realize. But it paid off. Ukraine, once reliant on Soviet doctrine and gear, transformed its military structure and operational capability under fire while defending its sovereignty with courage, combat savvy, and increasing skill.\n\nBut that transformation is incomplete. Wartime adaptation takes time, and measured support is what allowed Ukraine to build resilience without collapse.\n\nShare\n\nTHIS WAR HAS ENTERED A NEW and particularly dangerous phase. Russia is pressing every advantage it can muster—not through strategic brilliance, but through terror strikes, brute force, massed missile launches, disinformation campaigns, and war crimes.\n\nPutin knows he can’t defeat Ukraine outright with the tools of conventional warfare. But he doesn’t need to—not if the West grows hesitant. Russia’s playbook now is attrition: destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure, immiserate its people, and undermine its alliances while waiting for the West to get bored or distracted. In that last point, especially, they have learned their lessons by watching us over the years.\n\nWe have seen all this before—in Georgia, in Syria, in Moldova, and in other so-called “frozen conflicts” that exist across Eastern Europe. This time, Russia realizes it’s not just about taking territory. It’s about breaking a nation’s will—not the Ukrainians’, but ours.\n\nWill, once broken, is a very difficult thing to repair. The leaders of China, Iran, and North Korea—not to mention terrorist groups around the world—are watching closely.\n\nHaving worked directly with the Ukrainian military as the commander of U.S. Army Europe,I saw how hungry their leaders and soldiers were for real reform, how eager they were to shed Soviet legacy, embrace NATO values, and become a force rooted in trust, values, initiative, and mission command. They did all that to help fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the American-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, but truthfully they also did it to prepare for what they believed was inevitable: a Russian attack on their borders.\n\nUkraine’s fight has become a laboratory for twenty-first-century warfare: integrating drones, countering electronic warfare, adapting logistics, and refining precision fires. Their transformation is no longer theoretical—it is real, visible, and growing. But in the short term, it still needs sustained material support.\n\nIn return for our munitions and old weapons, we’re not just helping them; we are also learning from them. The U.S. Army has recognized the elements of evolving warfare and is applying Ukraine’s lessons in real time into our force through initiatives like “Transformation In Contact”—a structured effort to integrate Ukrainian battlefield innovations into how we train, equip, and fight. From dispersed command-and-control structures to drone-enabled targeting and decentralized maneuver, Ukraine’s experience is reshaping how we all understand future warfighting.\n\nThat is not just value-added—it’s vital. But only if Ukraine continues to survive and adapt. Without our help, this battle lab of learning for us—and for other Western nations—goes dark.\n\nShare\n\nSOME POLICYMAKERS BELIEVE that Ukraine is a distraction, and that somehow the war in Ukraine and a potential conflict with China exist in separate universes. This belief is a form of Flat Earthism in its obstinate refusal to acknowledge that every part of the world is connected to every other.\n\nOthers believe that by delaying shipments or equivocating in our support, we are buying time, acting with appropriate caution, or gaining leverage for future peace talks that those who see the situation clearly know Putin will never join. In reality, we are buying risk—for Ukraine, for NATO, and for ourselves. Every day of delay or mixed messaging allows Russia to make gains it could not otherwise achieve. Every shipment withheld erodes the deterrent effect of Western unity. Every pause in ammunition transfers gives Putin space to maneuver—militarily, politically, and psychologically.\n\nOur allies see this. In the last few weeks, I’ve visited Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. They are under no illusion about what happens if Ukraine loses. These are nations that lived for decades under Soviet occupation. They still carry the memory of repression and forced Russification. This is not historical abstraction; it’s lived experience. And it’s why they are taking bold steps now: increasing defense spending, hardening infrastructure, raising readiness levels, and reinforcing NATO battle groups on their territory.\n\nThey know they will be next if Russia succeeds in Ukraine. And we should believe them. But they can’t, and they shouldn’t, do it alone.\n\nThis isn’t about politics, it’s about principle. The American people, in poll after poll, continue to support Ukrainian resistance. And our NATO allies have shown remarkable solidarity and evenincreased dedicationto the cause of Ukrainian victory and European defense.\n\nShare\n\nNOW IS NOT A TIME, if ever there was one, for weakness and timidity. Congress has appropriated aid, but Congress’s voice isn’t limited to a vote. Members from both parties—especially those who don’t have to worry about re-election—should demand that their already-authorized aid be delivered without delay, and Congress must ensure accountability for any executive interference that weakens our commitments.\n\nMembers of the Trump administration should recognize that allied leaders are difficult in the best of circumstances, and that the closest and most important leaders are often the most difficult. This was true during both World Wars and has been true ever since. But the alliances themselves are priceless. Support for Ukraine isn’t about loyalty to any leader—it’s about strategic foresight. Supporting Zelensky isn’t identical to supporting Ukraine—indeed, some Ukrainians may even prefer a new president in the next election. But regardless of what one thinks of one man, abandoning Ukraine at this juncture would be seen worldwide for what it is: not our restraint, but our surrender.\n\nEisenhower understood that dictators are never overcome by diffidence. And he understood that America needs free allies for our own freedom to be secure. The Trump administration would do well to reflect on these lessons that Eisenhower’s generation learned at the cost of hundreds of thousands of American lives.\n\nUkraine is holding on. Barely, but bravely. Let’s not make them hold on alone or for much longer.\n\nShare",

    "News_title":"Opinion - Jerome Powell is competing to be the worst Fed chair in history",
    "News_text":"By stubbornly refusing to lower interest rates despite ample data urging him to do so, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is committing his third major policy blunder in six years.\n\nIf he continues this tight-money path through the July 29 Fed meeting, “Too Late” Powell will go down as the worst Fed chair in history.\n\nIt’s not like Powell lacks stiff competition. In the 1970s, to boost Richard Nixon’s re-election run, uber‑partisan Arthur Burns kept rates too low for too long, triggering a dizzying inflation spiral and a decade-long stagflation.\n\nIn the 1990s, Alan Greenspan severely underestimated productivity gains from the tech boom, over-estimated inflationary pressures, and needlessly hiked rates — six times between June 1999 and May 2000.  This spiked the federal funds rate to 6.5 percent, triggering the dot-com market crash and 2001 recession.\n\nA whiplashed Greenspan then slashed rates to rock-bottom levels and held them at 1 percent for a full year — from June 2003 to June 2004 — well beyond what the recovery warranted. This ultra-cheap money fueled reckless lending, a massive housing bubble, and ultimately detonated the 2007–2008 financial collapse.\n\nGreenspan’s successor, Ben Bernanke, should have seen it coming. But the Princeton don failed to grasp rising systemic risk in mortgage markets. His paralysis turned what might have been a contained correction into a full-blown global financial crisis — only intervening after Lehman Brothers fell, when it was already too late.\n\nNow enters Jay Powell. Even though he leads the world’s largest economy, he is a lawyer, not an economist — an anomaly among Fed chairs.  Since Arthur Burns, every Fed chair has held an economics degree, except for G. William Miller and Powell.\n\nMiller was similarly unqualified and endured one of the most disastrous Fed tenures in recent memory spanning just 517 days before being replaced by the esteemed Paul Volcker on August 6, 1979.\n\nPowell’s audition for “worst Fed chair” began shortly after his February 2018 appointment. Promising President Trump in the Oval Office a supportive posture to secure his nomination, Powell instead aggressively raised rates into the low-inflation, high-growth Trump economy.\n\nPowell wrongly believed Trump’s tax cuts and tariffs would spark inflation — they didn’t. Nor did Powell understand that Trump’s efforts to deregulate the economy and reach energy independence — positive “supply shocks” in the macroeconomics vernacular — would provide positive deflationary benefits.\n\nAs Powell’s Fed hiked interest rates four times in 2018—despite muted inflation and strong labor market gains — economic momentum slowed sharply.  According to the Fed’s own September Tealbook, most of the expected GDP slowdown — from over 3 percent to 1.5 percent — was due to Powell’s blunder.\n\nTrump was justifiably outraged over Powell’s first blunder. It would cost the American economy hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic output and tax revenues.\n\nAfter Trump left the White House in January 2021, Powell successfully lobbied Joe Biden for a second term. Throughout that year, the Powell-led Fed kept interest rates near zero, even as inflation surged past 5 percent by mid-year.\n\nEmbracing the Biden-Yellen line that inflation was merely “transitory,” the pandering Powell refused to act. Despite growing warnings from economists and business leaders, Powell waited until March 2022 — more than a year after inflation had begun accelerating — before implementing the first interest rate hike since 2018.\n\nBy then, the damage was done. The Fed was forced into one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in history — 11 hikes in 12 months — all to combat the inflation that Powell’s inaction had helped unleash.\n\nPowell’s second major blunder here wasn’t just his late policy; it was his silent permissiveness. While a Democrat-controlled Congress passed over $2 trillion in unneeded and wasteful spending bills — in no small part to boost the Biden reelection campaign — Powell failed in his ethical duty to warn the White House and Democrat-controlled Congress that this spending would worsen inflation. Instead, he let loose monetary policy and partisan fiscal profligacy collide, accelerating the very inflation he would soon be forced to chase.\n\nToday, with inflation returning to target and disinflation gaining traction, Powell is well on his way to his third blunder with his stubborn refusal to lower interest rates now. Powell seems incapable of recognizing that Trumponomics — driven by pro-growth deregulation, productivity-enhancing tax cuts, strategic tariffs, and America First supply chain policies — is again delivering strong GDP growth and low unemployment without fueling inflation, just as in Trump’s prosperous first term.\n\nPowell’s misguided fixation on so-called tariff “uncertainties” as a rationale for “prudently” holding rates steady is particularly imprudent. Let’s remember clearly: during President Trump’s first term, we imposed tariffs strategically and aggressively — and the predicted inflation never materialized. Powell’s hesitation reflects a failure to learn from recent economic history, needlessly stifling growth, undermining American competitiveness, and harming millions of Americans.\n\nAt its next meeting July 29-30, the Fed must immediately begin cutting rates.  If Powell won’t adjust course, he will indeed have earned the sobriquet of worst Fed chair.\n\nPeter Navarro is White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Syria Envoy Tom Barrack has moved quickly to increase US ties to the new Syrian government. He has travelled around the region and is the US Ambassador to Turkey as well.\n\nUS Syria Envoy Tom Barrackis in Lebanon for important discussions. This is a crucial opportunity for Lebanon to move beyond years of conflict and regain its status as a successful country. To do that, it needs to collect arms from groups like Hezbollah. “A US envoy met Lebanese officials in Beirut on Monday to discuss a proposedplan to disarm Hezbollah, hours after Israel launched new air strikes and a cross-border ground assault,” Reuters said.\n\nHezbollah may be willing to reduce its arsenal, Reuters claims. However, the US and others would prefer to see Hezbollah fully disarmed. “Lebanon formed a committee to draft a response. Hezbollah was expected to provide its own feedback to its ally, Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, to incorporate into a counter-proposal being prepared in time for Barrack's Monday visit,” Reuters noted.\n\nPrior to heading to Lebanon, Barrack posted an article by Edward Gabriel, the former US Ambassador to Morocco and currently the President of the American Task Force on Lebanon. The article was titled “Lebanon’s Opportunity—or Missed Opportunity?” Gabriel argues that the changes in the region, such as the fall of the Assad regime and Israel’s weakening ofHezbollahin 2024, should lead to Lebanon being “the biggest beneficiary of these seismic regional shifts.\n\nDecades of war and conflict, economic collapse, systemic corruption, and the overpowering shadow of Hezbollah have brought Lebanon to its knees. But the tide may finally be turning.”\n\nBarrack posted on July 5, “Lebanon’s hope awakens!!! The opportunity is now. This is a historic moment to supersede the strained confessionalism of the past and finally fulfill Lebanon’s true promise of the hope of ‘One country, one people, one army.’ As [President Trump] has consistently shared with the world, \"Lebanon is a great place, with great people. Let's make Lebanon Great again.”\n\nThe visit by the US envoy is important. Pro-Iranian media in Lebanon have taken notice.Al-Akhbarnoted that “the Israeli enemy expanded its airstrikes this evening, targeting areas in the South and the Bekaa Valley. This escalation comes on the eve of the arrival of US Special Envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Beirut.\n\n\"The three presidents are expected to meet to receive Lebanon's official response to the US proposal, which stipulates that arms be restricted to the state.” The report noted that key figures inLebanon, including the President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of Parliament, are preparing a response to Barrack’s proposals.\n\nBarrack is a skilled envoy. He has moved quickly to increase US ties to the new Syrian government. He has travelled around the region. He is the US Ambassador to Turkey as well. This means it is a key figure in US policy in the region. His role in Lebanon appears important as well. Barrack may be able to help bring peace and stability.",

    "News_text":"The president of Iran has claimed that Israel tried to assassinate him during the 12-day war between the two countries.\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian said Israel attempted to “bombard” the area where he was holding a meeting in order to kill him “but they failed”.\n\nIsrael Katz, the Israeli defence minister, publicly admitted that his country had tried to kill Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during the conflict but it was previously known whether the country had also targeted Tehran’s president.\n\nWar erupted between the two countries on June 13 when Israel launched a surprise wave of attacks against Iran’s nuclear facilities, days before Tehran and Washington were set to meet for a new round of nuclear talks.\n\nPezeshkian spoke to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a rare interview with a Western journalist.\n\nHe said his country had “no problem” renegotiating with the US over its nuclear programme, provided that trust can be reestablished between the two countries.\n\n“There is a condition ... for restarting the talks. How are we going to trust the United States again? We re-entered the negotiations, then how can we know for sure that in the middle of the talks the Israeli regime will not be given the permission again to attack us.”\n\nDonald Trump is set to discuss a permanent deal between Israel and Iran when Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, visits the White House later today.\n\nBoth leaders have also expressed confidence that a ceasefire deal with Hamas could be reached this week.\n\nThank you for following our live coverage.\n\nWe’ll be back with more news and analysis soon.\n\nIran has never tried to kill Donald Trump, the country’s president has said.\n\nAsked whether his country had ever sent hit out against the US president, Masoud Pezeshkian told Tucker Carlson: “This is actually what [Benjamin Netanyahu] is trying to insinuate and make your people or the president of your country believe.\n\n“But this is wrong, because Netanyahu has his own agenda. He wants to drag the US into forever wars and bring more instability and insecurity and unrest to the whole region.”\n\nThe US government brought charges against an Afghan national in November in connection with an alleged Iranian plot to kill Mr Trump.\n\nThe Department of Justice alleged that Farhad Shakeri, 51, was tasked with “providing a plan” to kill the US president.\n\nIran’s president said Americans should not be scared of his country, despite Tehran’s leaders frequently chanting “death to America!”\n\n“I believe this is a very wrong impression that anybody might have of Iran or the Iranians. I would like to remind you that Iran has never invaded another country in the last 200 years,” Pezeshkian told Tucker Carlson.\n\n“When they say death to the United States, it doesn’t mean death to the people of the United States or even to the officials of the United States, they mean death to crimes, death to killing and carnage, death to supporting killing others, death to insecurity and instability.”\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian, the Iranian president, claimed that Israel tried to kill him in a new interview with Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, on X.\n\n“They did try, yes. They acted accordingly, but they failed,” Pezeshkian told Carlson, who asked whether Israel had tried to kill him.\n\n“It was not the United States that was behind the attempt on my life. It was Israel. I was in a meeting... they tried to bombard the area in which we were holding that meeting,” he added.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu was in favour. So, too, was Ehud Barak, his defence minister at the time in 2011. But Israel’s top generals and intelligence chiefs were aghast. An attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, they feared, could result in tens of thousands of Israeli civilian deaths.\n\nMonths after retiring as Mossad chief that year, Meir Dagan – one of Israel’s most revered spymasters – even went as far as to call the idea “the stupidest I’ve ever heard”.\n\nYet 14 years later, despite widespread opposition at home and abroad, Mr Netanyahu’s boldest gamble appears to have paid off. In just 12 days, he humbled Iran at a cost much lower than even Israel’s most optimistic military planners would have dared hope.\n\nWhen he walks into the White House on Monday, the Israeli prime minister’s meeting with Donald Trump will therefore have the feel of a Roman triumph. Both men will portray their battlefield success as vindication over the wishy-washiness of their critics.\n\nBut they are also thinking beyond victory laps. Mr Trump hopes to burnish his peacemaking credentials by brokering another ceasefire in Gaza. His guest will aim higher still, arguing that he has helped birth a new regional order – one that could mark the dawn of a golden era for Israel.\n\nThomas Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, said he was satisfied by the Lebanese authorities’ response to Washington’s request to disarm Hezbollah, which was heavily weakened in a recent war with Israel.\n\nLebanese leaders who took office in the aftermath of the conflict have vowed a state monopoly on bearing arms, while demanding Israel comply with a ceasefire that ended the war with Hezbollah in November.\n\n“I’m unbelievably satisfied with the response,” Mr Barrack told a press conference after meeting President Joseph Aoun.\n\n“It’s thoughtful, it’s considered. We’re creating a go-forward plan. To create that, we need dialogue. What the government gave us was something spectacular,” he said.\n\n“Now what it takes is a... thrust to the details, which we’re going to do. We’re both committed to get to the details and get a resolution,” he said, adding: “I’m very, very hopeful.”\n\nDonald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu sit down on Monday after the first round of formal indirect talks with Hamas in Doha ended without agreement.\n\nThe terror group had already demanded revisions on the scope of the Israeli withdrawal in the event of a deal, also the size of humanitarian zones and the distribution methods of aid, which Israel had criticised as unacceptable.\n\nIt was reported today that the Israeli team in Doha lacked the authority to strike a deal.\n\nHowever, it had been thought that on the main meat of a 60-day ceasefire, the parties were broadly in step.\n\nAlthough details are unclear, the proposal is believed to include a five-stage release of living and dead hostages across the two months.\n\nBy the end of that period, roughly half of the living hostages - 10 - would have made it home. This would be accompanied by the release of, presumably, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a significant Israeli withdrawal and a dramatic increase in the volume of aid.\n\nThe key sticking point, as it has been since January, is likely to be what happens after - whether Israel will even entertain the idea of ending the war without defeating Hamas.\n\nMr Netanyahu has sounded bellicose on this in recent days. However, he loses nothing by appearing resolute at that stage.\n\nThe real test will come when he sits down with Mr Trump and finds out just how fiercely his great patron in Washington is demanding an end to the fighting.\n\nThat is likely to be when the talks in Dohar begin in practice.\n\nA small group of Hamas leaders will be allowed to remain in Gaza under a watered down ceasefire deal, according to reports.\n\nIsrael had been pushing for the complete exile of Hamas’s leaders but will now settle for the symbolic expulsion of a few military commanders given there are so few of them left, Axios reported.\n\n“There aren’t many senior Hamas officials left in Gaza. We are not going to need a big ship to send them to exile — even a small dinghy will do,” an Israeli official said.\n\nA senior Hamas security official told the BBC that 95 per cent of Hamas’s leadership had been killed by Israel and that the terror group had lost control over most of the Gaza Strip.\n\n“Let’s be realistic here - there’s barely anything left of the security structure. Most of the leadership, about 95%, are now dead... The active figures have all been killed,” he said. “So really, what’s stopping Israel from continuing this war?”\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu arrived in Washington this morning ahead of a meeting with Donald Trump about ending the war in Gaza. Both leaders expressed hope a deal could be reached this week, despite talks in Qatar on Sunday ending without an agreement.\n\nHala Abu Dahlez, a 12-year-old Palestinian girl, is receiving treatment from her father inside their tent in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip.\n\nHala sustained serious head injuries in March when a metal swing set collapsed on her following an Israeli airstrike, resulting in a head injury.\n\nShe underwent several surgeries, but doctors say she requires specialised treatment outside the Gaza Strip.\n\nOct 7, 2023- Hundreds of Hamas terrorists storm into southern Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking 251 hostages back into Gaza\n\nOct 27- Israel launches a ground invasion of Gaza\n\nNov 24-30- 105 hostages are exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners\n\nOct 17, 2024 -Israel kills Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in southern Gaza.

The document said the war in Gaza had “created a once-in-a-century opportunity to rebuild Gaza from first principles . . . as a secure, modern prosperous society”.\n\nIt pitched Gaza as a future trading hub, featuring artificial islands, a deep-water port connecting it to the India-Middle East-Europe corridor, blockchain-based trade, and low-tax economic zones.\n\nBCG’s final slide deck, which runs to more than 30 pages, differed significantly from a paper written by TBI’s staff.\n\nTBI has distanced itself from the initiative, insisting it had no role in preparing the slide deck.

Most of the leadership, about 95%, are now dead... The active figures have all been killed,” he said. “So really, what’s stopping Israel from continuing this war?”\n\nThe officer continued: “So, the security situation is zero. Hamas’s control is zero. There’s no leadership, no command, no communication. Salaries are delayed, and when they do arrive, they’re barely usable. Some die just trying to collect them. It’s total collapse.”\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has landed in Washington ahead of his third visit to the White House in six months.\n\nMr Netanyahu will have dinner with the US president on Monday evening, where the two leaders will discuss bringing about an end to the war in Gaza.\n\n“I believe the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance these results,” he said before setting off from Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump said he believed a hostage release and ceasefire deal could be reached this week, which could lead to the release of “quite a few hostages”.\n\nIsrael attacked Houthi targets in three Yemeni ports and a power plant early on Monday, marking the first Israeli attack on Yemen in almost a month.\n\nThe strikes on Hodeidah, Ras Isa and Salif ports, and Ras Qantib power plant were due to repeated Houthi attacks on Israel, the military said.\n\nHours after the strikes, the Israeli military said two missiles were launched from Yemen.

    "News_title":"MAS’ Implosion Has Blown Bolivia’s Presidential Election Wide Open",
    "News_text":"After weeks of uncertainty, protest and violence, the field for Bolivia’s elections has finally settled. Incumbent President Luis Arce and former President Evo Morales, who were bitterly vying to lead the ruling Movement toward Socialism into the elections this August—have in effect removed each other from the competition. In the process, they have crashed the prospects of their party, known by its Spanish acronym MAS, and thrown the doors open to the opposition, which has its best chance in 20 years to win power at the ballot box.\n\nTherift between one-time allies Arce and Moraleshas effectively split Bolivia’s most successful political party. Morales, who first led the MAS to power in 2006, was ousted in 2019 after a disputed election in which he sought a controversial fourth term in office. He was forced into exile, only to return when Arce, his former finance minister and handpicked candidate for the MAS, retook the presidency in a rerun election in 2020. Morales came back with the desire to lead the MAS into the 2025 elections. But it soon became clear that Arce held the same ambition.\n\nMorales’ candidacy for the presidency is now all but off the table. In May, the Constitutional Court, over which Arce’s executive branch exercisessignificant influence, ruled that Morales wasunable to runin the coming elections. It had already removed him from the presidency of the MAS andhanded the partyto an Arce loyalist. Morales nonetheless tried unsuccessfully to register his candidacy under the banner of other parties. In June, his followers mounted violent protests, leavingsix dead, including four police officers, but failed to force the issue. They continue to insist on Morales’ candidacy andthreaten that“there won’t be elections” if he is not on the ballot.\n\n“Last week his followers once again declared him their candidate for the presidency,” said Jose Luis Exeni, a political analyst at Friedrich Ebert Stiftung in La Paz, speaking of Morales. “But I don’t think he has any possibility of being a candidate now.”\n\nTo get more in-depth news and expert analysis on global affairs from WPR,sign up for our free Daily Review newsletter.\n\nArce may have succeeded in removing Morales from the race, but he has presided over aneconomic collapsethat left his own bid for a second term as president in tatters. Morales exacerbated the situation by having his followers mountcostly blockadesand getting legislators who remain loyal to him tovote againstArce’s legislative agenda. After polls put his support atless than 2 percent, Arce withdrew his candidacy for the MAS. He has been replaced by Eduardo del Castillo, his interior minister and ally, who will face many of the same challenges, as evidenced by the latest polling, which put Castillo’s support atless than 2 percentas well.\n\n“Castillo is bearing the cost of the poor economic management of this government, whose results have been so evident in recent months, and which people are living every day,” said Maria Teresa Zegada, a political scientist at the Universidad Mayor de San Simon in Cochabamba.\n\nWith Arce and Morales out of the running and Castillo polling so poorly, Andronico Rodriguez, the 36-year-old president of the Senate and vice president of Morales’ union of coca farmers, has emerged as the last hope for the MAS’ now divided coalition. Rodriguez was long seen as Morales’ political heir, but he has beenlabeled a traitorfor launching his own candidacy. Still, even if Morales refuses to back him, Rodriguez will be hoping to win over some of his supporters.\n\n“I think there will be a split between the most loyal, who will do whatever Morales says, and the more pragmatic, who decide it is better to have some kind of [formal political] presence,” said Exeni.\n\nMuch still depends on what Morales, who retains strong support among the rural and indigenous working class, decides to do. In a last-ditch effort, he sought to strike a deal with other parties to substitute him in as their candidate for the presidency. But the deadline for that came and went on July 3. He has untilAug. 13to hammer out a similar deal to have his followers substituted in as candidates for Congress, which would allow his faction to retain political influence. But absent that, Morales may call for his followers to vote null or to boycott the vote entirely. The latter could prevent voting from taking place in parts of Bolivia where his support is strongest. It could also lead tomore violence.\n\nThe implosion of the MAS has presented a singular opportunity for the opposition to win power at the ballot box. In 2019, it headed the unelected interim government that ruled between Morales’ ouster and Arce’s election. However, it too is fragmented this year, with three leading candidates splitting the vote.\n\nThe frontrunner is Samuel Doria Medina, a multimillionaire businessman who ran for the presidency in 2005, 2009 and 2014. Doria Medina is running as a center-right candidate, having assembled a broad political coalition. Then there is Jorge Quiroga, a former vice president who briefly held the presidency after then-President Hugo Banzer retired for health reasons in 2001. Quiroga is the most rightwing candidate with a real chance at power. And finally there is Manfred Reyes Villa, a former military officer who has been a local political figure in the department of Cochabamba for 30 years, and who ran for president in 2002 and 2009.\n\nAll are familiar faces in Bolivian politics, Exeni noted. “The opposition is going with the same candidates from 20, 25 years ago,” he said. “There’s been no innovation in discourse, in leadership.”\n\nCredible surveys show none of the 10 candidates polling above 20 percent. Since a first-round win requires a candidate to receive either 50 percent of the vote, or at least 40 percent with a 10 percent lead over the second-place finisher, a run-off in October seems guaranteed. As it stands, the leaders are Doria Medina, Quiroga and Rodriguez, in that order.\n\nBut it’s possible there is a hidden MAS vote not being picked up by the polls. “That’s what happened in 2020,” said Zegada, when despite polling ataround 30 percentahead of the election, Arce finished with 55 percent on Election Day.\n\nIf the first-round vote ends up being as diffuse as polls suggest, the next president will be leading a minority government and forced to seek pacts with diverse groups in Congress to govern. This would mark a tectonic shift from the past 20 years, when the MAS governed with majorities and even supermajorities—until legislators loyal to Morales stopped voting with Arce’s government. In the next Congress, the MAS as well as all the other political parties will have to relearn how to strike deals.\n\nAnd they will have to do so amid an urgent economic crisis. Bolivia has almost run out ofliquid international reserves, leading to severe fuel shortages that periodically bring the country to a halt. Dollars are almost unobtainable at the official exchange rate, which is pegged at roughly 7 bolivianos to the dollar, leading to black-market exchange rates that price the dollar betweentwo and three timesas much. All of this has driven inflation up, which hit15.5 percentin the first half of this year.\n\n“Every candidate assumes immediate anti-crisis measures will be needed,” said Exeni. “What is not clear is whether they should be shock or gradual, and whether it should be with the International Monetary Fund. But it’s undeniable that Bolivia will need loans.”\n\nIn the midst of all this, it could almost pass unnoticed that the MAS, Bolivia’s most successful political party for the past two decades, risks losing its legal status if it obtains less than 3 percent of the vote in the election—as surveys suggest it will. “I think the MAS as a political instrument already ceased to exist,” said Exeni. “What remains to be seen is if a new one can be built.”\n\nWhether the same coalition of class and ethnic interests can be reassembled under a new banner will depend on how Rodriguez performs—and, as has been the case for 20 years now in Bolivian politics, on what Morales decides to do.\n\nThomas Graham is a freelance journalist currently based in Mexico, and previously based in Bolivia.

    "News_title":"Flights to return to Israel as European Aviation Safety Agency removes restrictions",
    "News_text":"The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has lifted its flight restrictions on Israel, allowing airlines to resume operations and restoring Israel’s position on the global aviation map.\n\nAll restrictions imposed by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on flights to Israel have been lifted, and the agency's recommendation to avoid flying to Israel has been removedThe Foreign Affairs Ministryannounced on Monday.\n\n\"This is an important step that will immediately impact major airlines that have not resumed their operations to Israel sinceOperation Rising Lionand missile attacks from Iran. These airlines will now be able to return to flying to Israel, restoring Israel to the international aviation map with full strength,\" the ministry stated.\n\nEASA, which operates under theEuropean Unionand ensures aviation safety in member states and among external operators, addressed the extension of the flight warning issued to Israel last month amid the conflict with Iran.\n\nThe warning, known as CZIB Number 2025-02 R2, was issued following a military strike by Israel on Iranian territory, which led to retaliatory attacks from Iran. This created a significant risk to the airspace of Israel, Iran, and neighboring countries, leading many foreign airlines to cease operations. These operations resumed on Monday.\n\nAs part of the warning,EASAadvised flight operators to avoid flying through Israel’s airspace, as well as similar restrictions in Iran, Iraq, and Jordan, due to concerns over the potential for a renewed deterioration in security and disruptions to air traffic management systems.\n\nThough the restrictions were originally set to expire, they were extended until today to allow for further assessment of the situation.\n\nThe ceasefire between Israel and Iran reached about two weeks ago, has brought relative calm, but concerns persist over the potential collapse of the agreement and the return of violence, particularly due to tensions in Lebanon and on the Hezbollah front.\n\nEASA emphasized that its goal was not to block the skies but to ensure that operators conduct ongoing risk assessments and remain informed with real-time alerts. As a result, the latest recommendations include specific exemptions for flights to Beirut, provided that they land and take off from the sea under close supervision.\n\nHowever, Israel remains a high-risk area due to its proximity to active conflict zones and the possibility of unintended interceptions. Aviation industry sources predict that if the decision allows regular flights to Israel to resume, it will provide a significant boost to airlines that had canceled flights following the escalation.\n\nThis includes major carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France and leading low-cost airlines, which had suspended popular routes to Ben Gurion Airport. Forecasts suggest that once the market stabilizes and demand rises, flight prices may decrease sharply as competition intensifies on several routes.\n\nAlong with EASA’s decision, foreign airlines are closely monitoring the position of the Israeli Ministry of Finance. Airlines are demanding compensation or indemnification from the government for losses incurred due to flight cancellations and delays during the military escalations, arguing that the security situation was beyond their control. Without a compensation mechanism, they contend that it will be difficult for them to resume long-term operations in Israel, even if the European warnings are lifted.\n\nThe industry has been waiting eagerly for the agency’s decision. The resumption of flights to Israel could bring much-needed hope to the tourism and aviation sectors, which have been severely impacted since June due to the regional airspace closure.\n\nIf no unusual developments occur on the ground, most airlines are expected to quickly reopen their routes, aiming to recover their lost revenues.",

    "News_text":"INGRAM, Texas — Samuel Cummings spent much of Monday wading through knee-high floodwaters, trudging across muddy fields, digging into mounds of dirt and slashing through thickets of brush with a chain saw.\n\nBut the physical demands of the search and recovery efforts near flood-battered Kerrville were nothing compared with the emotional gut punch of what Cummings saw strewn underfoot: girls’ Crocs and tennis shoes, volleyballs and water bottles.\n\nThe objects are the tragic remnants of Camp Mystic, where 27 girls and counselors died inflash floods that ripped through central Texasover the weekend, leaving at least 104 people dead or missing across six counties.\n\n“That’s where you start to get choked up,” said Cummings, who spoke to NBC News roughly 5 miles downstream of Camp Mystic as helicopters circled overhead.\n\nCummings, 22, a recent college graduate who lives in Corpus Christi, jumped in his Ford truck and headed straight for the flood-ravaged region Sunday night. He grew up in Kerrville and swam in the Guadalupe River as a kid.\n\nHe wanted to help. He felt he had no choice.\n\nThe monstrous floods abruptlytore through Central Texasovernight Friday during the Fourth of July holiday weekend, inundating buildings, trapping residents in their homes and leaving a trail of death in their wake.\n\nThese Texas Hill Country communities are usually an oasis of trees and water for many who come from the congested, busier cities of Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, as well as other parts of the country.\n\nNow, the serenity some seek here is broken up by the buzz of chain saws and whoop-whoop-whoop of helicopter blades, including an occasional military Chinook.\n\nSoggy tree bark, hefty branches and whole tree trunks are smashed up against railings, homes, and whatever else stood in the water’s path but didn’t collapse from its force. The Guadalupe River water surrounds trees that once stood on solid ground, with many now bowed against each other like a stack of dominoes.\n\nLocal residents wear faces of shock and sadness as they take in the destruction. Landmarks like the shops in Old Ingram Loop were nearly emptied by the river, refilled with mud or splintered to pieces.\n\nAmid the devastation, first responders and volunteers trudge into muck and mud, scramble over debris piles and check emotions to poke and prod and chop and saw in search of still-missing victims.\n\nBrandie Masters, who lives in nearby Mountain Head with her husband, Jared, felt it was her responsibility to assist in the aftermath.\n\nJared spent part of Monday behind the wheel of an excavator, digging through “piles and piles and piles” of debris, Masters said. She stayed on foot, scouring the muck for any signs of life.\n\nShe hasn’t yet found any bodies, but she has encountered grim reminders of the young lives lost: kayaks, sports gear, little girls’ clothes.\n\nMasters, 42, doesn’t know when she and Jared will return home. They plan to “stay as long as it takes.” They might sleep in their car overnight.\n\n“A lot of men are out here working really hard to recover families,” Masters said. “God is ultimately in control. Everyone just needs to pray.”\n\nDennis Price, founder and CEO of Heroes for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that sends out veterans, first responders, medical personnel and other crews after disasters, described surreal scenes, including a dead cow stuck high in a tree.\n\nPrice also saw “60 to 80 RVs pinned up against trees,” some stacked “about 20 feet high with fallen trees, other debris and just pieces of vehicles smashed up, torn up and then flipped over.”\n\nHe said his volunteers in the hardest-hit areas told him Monday they found two pairs of bodies as part of their rescue and recovery efforts. One of the team members put on his amphibious gear and “went down into a river and pulled out two family members.”\n\nTwo more people were found along the riverbank, he said.\n\n“It’s a massive tragedy. We feel for the families. We feel for all these people, and we keep them in our prayers. That’s why we support every way we can,” he said.\n\nMark Edwards, field operations manager for the nonprofit group Texas EquuSearch, deployed more than 120 trained volunteers on horseback, in ATVs and on foot to look for survivors and victims. The team included Robert Crow, a member of Tejas Vaqueros, a riding group from Houston.\n\n“I have two daughters. I know what it feels like. I don’t know what it feels like to lose them,” Crow said as he threw blankets over his horse, Peaches.\n\nEdwards is an experienced search-and-rescue professional whose teams coordinate with law enforcement. But disaster aftermath still takes an emotional toll, he said, even if it takes some time to absorb.\n\n“I’ve learned to have a trigger switch.

    "News_title":"As Dalai Lama Turns 90, Dangerous Questions Loom for Tibet",
    "News_text":"ON JULY 2, THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMAannouncedthat, like his predecessors, he will be reincarnated. The statement, timed to coincide with his birthday—the exiled spiritual leader turned 90 on July 6—came from Dharamsala, India, where he has lived since fleeing Tibet in 1959.\n\nThe Dalai Lama’s announcement brought joy and relief for Tibetans. Previously, he had left open the possibility that the ancient line of Tibetan theocratic leaders could end with him.\n\nFar from an arcane religious matter, the Dalai Lama’s decision confirms that after his death, the world will be confronted with a legitimate Tibetan spiritual leader chosen through traditional methods overseen by the Dalai Lama’s office—as well as an impostor chosen by the Chinese Communist Party, which has occupied Tibet since it invaded in 1950.\n\nA strategic competition is underway. Beijing is devoting financial resources and diplomatic pressure in support of its quest to gain international deference to a “Dalai Lama” it will appoint and control. Washington has yet to give the matter, and Tibet more broadly, the strategic importance they deserve.\n\nAfter the People’s Liberation Army invaded Tibet, the Dalai Lama tried to reach a modus vivendi with the Communists. In his new memoir,Voice for the Voiceless, published in many languages around the world in March, the Dalai Lama recounts how during his 1955 visit to Beijing, Mao mistook the 19-year-old Tibetan leader’s effort at accommodation for a lack of integrity. As the visit ended, the Chinese Communist leader misjudged the Tibetan leader and tried to co-opt him, then ended their last meeting with a comment the Dalai Lama recalls as “disconcerting”:\n\nAs the meeting came to a close, Mao told me, “Your attitude is good, you know. Religion is poison. It reduces the population because the monks and nuns must stay celibate and it neglects material progress.” I was shaken and attempted to hide my feelings. . . . It was then I knew despite all the hints of positive dialogue that he was the destroyer of Buddha Dharma.\n\nFour years later, as Chinese repression intensified, the Dalai Lama, then 23, trekked to the border with India and left Tibet for the last time. Generously welcomed by India’s leaders and people, he and his government settled ultimately in the hilltop town of Dharamsala. From there, he has sustained Tibetans in exile, preserving their religion, language, and culture while becoming a global figure sought after for his teachings on compassion and ethics.\n\nJoin the best pro-democracy community on the internet by signing up for a free or paidBulwarksubscription today.\n\nMUCH LESS APPRECIATED in policy circles is the transformation of Tibet’s ancient theocracy. In 2011, the Dalai Lama completed the democratic transition of the exile government, assigning his political, temporal powers to an elected parliament and prime minister. This radical break with thousands of years of tradition followed other democratic transitions at the end of the twentieth century in South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Indonesia that remade the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific region to one favoring democratic alliances and partnerships.\n\nYet unlike other American democratic allies, the Tibetan exile government remains isolated internationally, largely thanks to China’s intense diplomatic pressure. The Trump administration made matters worse by cutting aid to the exile government earlier this year. Although these cuts wererestoredin recent days, other steps marking a retreat from international leadership—massive cuts to foreign aid, gutting of international broadcasting, including Radio Free Asia and its Tibetan service, and disparagement of U.S. leadership on behalf of democracy and human rights—all leave a vacuum China is only too eager to fill.\n\nThe U.S. approach to Tibet has not been based on history or international law. Instead, it has fluctuated with Washington’s perceptions of its own strategic interests. The United States understood that Tibet was de facto independent after the 1912 collapse of the last Chinese imperial dynasty. But America’s WWII ally Chiang Kai-shek hoped to recover lost imperial territory, including Tibet. American officials did not wish to undermine him, even though they knew that he exerted no authority there.\n\nEven after the Communist takeover and Chiang’s flight to Taiwan, the United States tacitly supported his claim, now made from Taipei. Later, however, after the Carter administration decided to abandon Taiwan, Vice President MondaletoldDeng Xiaoping, “Our position, whenever asked, is that Tibet is part of China.” Henceforth, he promised, the Dalai Lama would be received as “a religious figure, not a political leader.” In effect, Washington transferred its deference over Tibet from Chiang’s cultish dictatorship that never exerted authority there to Beijing’s Communist regime that invaded and repressed Tibet. Ever since, the United States has tried to minimize conflict with Beijing over Tibet.\n\nFor its part, Beijing continues to elevate the importance it places on Tibet. The Chinese Communist Party’s Tibet agenda is part of its drive to recover imperial reach and grandeur. In 1995, it revived an imperial ritual to install its own Panchen Lama, the second-most prominent lama in the Dalai Lama’s Gelug sect. Chinese authorities detained the young boy the Dalai Lama identified as the authentic reincarnate Panchen Lama. He has not been heard from since.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party also pursues its Tibet agenda beyond China’s borders, co-opting and cultivating political and religious figures and appropriating Buddhist sites. In international organizations like the United Nations, China uses political and economic leverage to demand deference to its ahistorical claims to Tibet as part of China since antiquity and to intimidate countries from supporting the Dalai Lama or the exile government.\n\nJoin now\n\nWHAT ARE THE STAKES for the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama? Washington should anticipate intense Chinese pressure to accept its impostor, possibly even military force across China’s long border with India.\n\nBeijing will rely on pressure and brinkmanship to ensure concessions. Washington should show it takes the reincarnation and the Dalai Lama’s democratic legacy as seriously as Beijing does. It needs to start now to deny the impostor legitimacy—upgrading ties with the Tibetan government in Dharamsala and encouraging American allies around the world to do the same. In preparation for the Dalai Lama’s eventual death and the Chinese effort to exploit it, Washington should restore funding and staffing at Radio Free Asia. Finally, the State Department should sponsor an independent review of U.S. Tibet policy that results in an updated assessment of America’s strategic interest in Tibet and the safeguarding of the Dalai Lama’s legacy.\n\nA man of profound equanimity, the Dalai Lama likely did not intend his spare and simple announcement last week as a challenge to the United States and its allies. But it is.\n\nShare",

    "News_text":"The Israeli military says five of its soldiers have been killed after Palestinian fighters detonated explosive devices during an operation in northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoon area.\n\nIsraeli forces also killed at least 54 Palestinians indawn raidson Tuesday, as pressure mounted on Israel to strike a ceasefire deal with Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli military said the five soldiers, aged between 20 and 28, “fell during combat in the northern Gaza Strip”, while 14 others sustained injuries – two of them “severely wounded”.\n\nReporting from Jordan’s capital Amman, Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh said a “preliminary investigation” into the deaths of the soldiers had been opened.\n\n“What we understand is that the Israeli soldiers were attacked, then the unit that tried to come to their rescue was also attacked, and then a third group of soldiers that tried to extract them was also attacked,” she said.\n\nSince Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023, at least 887 of its soldiers have been killed.\n\nTuesday’s deaths came two weeks after Israel reported one of its deadliest days in months in Gaza, where seven soldiers were killed after a bomb was attached to their armoured vehicle.\n\nAbu Obeida, the spokesperson for the Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said the latest attack was “an additional blow … in an area the occupation thought was safe”, warning that the group would “inflict additional losses” on the Israeli military “every day”.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lamented a “difficult morning” as he visited Washington, DC, for talks with United States President Donald Trump, as the two leaders discussed theforced relocationof Palestinians out of Gaza.\n\nLast week, Trump had predicted Israeli and Hamas negotiators holding indirect ceasefire talks in Qatar could reach a deal this week.\n\nThe bloodshed in Gaza increases the pressure on Netanyahu to agree to the current US-backed proposals for a 60-day ceasefire to halt the 22-month offensive. Israeli polls have shown widespread support for ending the war.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on X: “For the sake of the fighters, for the sake of their families, for the sake of the hostages, for the sake of the State of Israel: this war must be ended.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Odeh said the opposition figures in Israel say soldiers have been dying in Gaza “not to protect Israel, but to protect Netanyahu’s coalition government”.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel continued its genocidal onslaught on Gaza, with medical sources telling Al Jazeera that at least 54 Palestinians had been killed since dawn on Tuesday.\n\n“It was a sleepless night here in Gaza, marked by an intensification of air attacks and the use of multiple aerial vehicles, including fighter jets, drones and helicopters to pummel residential areas and spaces that had been designated as ‘safe zones’,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nAt least nine Palestinians were killed during an Israeli drone attack on a tent sheltering displaced Palestinians in the al-Mawasi area near Gaza’s southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nIn a separate dawn attack, two people were killed and others injured in Israeli air raids on the Hakr al-Jami area in Deir el-Balah, the Wafa news agency reported, citing medical sources.\n\nIsraeli planes also bombed a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, reportedly killing at least four people.\n\nThe fighting has pushed the healthcare system in Gaza close to a total collapse. The Palestine Red Crescent on Tuesday said the Zeitoun medical clinic in Gaza City had ceased operations after shelling in the surrounding area.\n\nIt said the closure would force thousands of civilians to walk long distances for medical care or children’s vaccinations.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Abu Azzoum said Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza issued a statement on Monday, saying it would run out of fuel “within the next few hours” and calling on the international community to put pressure on Israel to allow deliveries.",

    "News_title":"Trump’s New Favorite General",
    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nSign up forTrump’s Return, a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nUpdated at 2:48 p.m. ET on July 9, 2025\n\nThe momentwas quickly overshadowed by other events—first an airline disaster in India, then the outbreak of war between Israel and Iran—but it was nevertheless noteworthy. On June 11, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared before a congressional appropriations committee alongside his boss,Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.Caine, personally selected by President Donald Trump in February and on the job for barely two months, had been keeping a very low profile. Until recently, it was impossible to find on the internet where and when he was born. (Elmira, New York, August 10, 1968.) Staying out of public view was a wise move, given this president’s fractious relationship with America’s military leaders. Trump has said he expects loyalty from “his” generals and casts them aside when they displease him.\n\nCaine’s immediate predecessor,General Charles Q. Brown, wasfiredjust 16 months into his four-year term for the apparent sin of having been appointed by President Biden. Brown, a decorated fighter pilot who is Black, was cast as both a product and an author of “woke” policies at the Pentagon, policies he neither controlled nor would have been free to ignore. Trump’s loathing of General Mark Milley, who preceded Brown, is widely known and ongoing; his official portrait in the Pentagon has been taken down, and earlier this year Hegseth claimed that Milley is under investigation. Brown and Milley are just two of Trump’s discarded and insulted military leaders. On Truth Social, the president has called H. R. McMaster, the former national security adviser, “WEAK AND TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE” and former Chief of Staff John Kelly “a LOWLIFE” and “a bad General”; Trump has also referred to former Defense Secretary James Mattis as “the world’s most overrated general.”\n\nBut now Caine was before the cameras. He faced a public session of a Senate subcommittee, and he was asked some questions that put him on the spot. One was from Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who asked about the immigration protests in Los Angeles. The administration had sent the National Guard and the Marines to the city to meet what it said was a “foreign invasion”—a claim being used to justify the legality of deploying American troops on American soil. Schatz asked: Did General Caine believe the country was being invaded?\n\n[From the November 2023 issue: How Mark Milley held the line]\n\nCaine replied, “Sir, thanks for your question. At this point in time, I don’t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading.”\n\nA second question came from Republican Senator and Trump confidant Lindsey Graham, who asked about Vladimir Putin’s territorial objectives. At the time, the Trump administration argued that Putin has no larger ambitions in Eastern Europe and that Russia will be satisfied with consolidating its gains in Ukraine. Graham asked: Did General Caine believe that Putin was prepared to stop in Ukraine?\n\n“I don’t believe he is, sir,” Caine replied.\n\nHegseth, seated next to Caine, and speaking at far greater length, was at pains to present a different view, but it was obvious what the headline was going to be. Within minutes, the CNN crawl read: “Trump’s Top General Just Undercut His ‘Invasion’ Claims.” TheWashington Postheadline read: “Trump’s Top General Contradicts His Assessment of Putin, L.A. Unrest.” In just a few words, Caine had very publicly called into question two of Donald Trump’s favorite assertions.\n\nTrump seemsto have been drawn to Air Force General Dan “Razin” Caine at least in part because he loved his nickname—which happens to be Caine’s F-16 call sign. In February, the president elevated Caine, a retired three-star general, to the nation’s highest military office. It was a typically unorthodox decision: Caine was promoted over the heads of all 38 active-duty four-star generals and admirals. He assumed his duties as the military faced pressure from the president for the use of federal troops as a domestic police force; soon, the president would order U.S. bombers and submarines to attack nuclear facilities in Iran.\n\nTrump has at least twice told the story of how he first encountered the former fighter pilot on a visit to the al-Asad Air Base, in western Iraq, in late December 2018. The president had gone, as he put it, “to meet the generals” and “find out why we’re not defeating ISIS.”\n\nThe Pentagon’s top command and his advisers were telling him that the effort would take many more months, possibly even years. So Trump was delighted when, in his telling, a frontline, lower-ranking officer at al-Asad told him that if more American power were unleashed, the job could be done in a week.\n\n“You’re the man I’m looking for,” the president said he told the officer. He related the story in his 2019 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC):\n\nI said, “What’s your name?”\n\n“Sir, my name is Razin.”\n\n“What the hell kind of a name?” I said. “Raisin, like the fruit?”\n\nHe goes, “Yes, sir, Razin.”\n\n“What’s your last name?”\n\n“Caine. Razin Caine.”\n\nI said, “You gotta be kidding me.” It’s true!\n\nStill smitten six years later, Trump embellished the story in another CPAC address. He related that someone—widely and wrongly interpreted as Caine—had donned a MAGA hat in that meeting, professed his love for Trump, and vowed to “kill” for him. Trump has no compunction about using the military as a backdrop for partisan purposes, but by long tradition the Pentagon stays out of politics. As Caine diplomatically put it during his Senate confirmation hearing in April, when reminded of Trump’s account, “I think the president was actually talking about somebody else.”\n\nTrump may have misremembered, but he didn’t forget. He had found his man, a seeming hell-raiser after his own heart. In February, weeks into his second term and six years after that meeting at al-Asad, Trump nominated Caine to head the Joint Chiefs. Caine is the first man chosen for the job who was outranked by all the other service chiefs. Multiple senators saluted Brown for his service during the confirmation hearing for Caine, who in turn thanked the general for his “more than 40 years of selfless service to our nation.” Caine was confirmed, but 25 senators, all Democrats, voted against him, less out of objection to Caine than concern about Trump’s handling of the appointment.\n\nAs tickled as Trump was about Caine’s call sign, it’s not clear what he thought it conveyed. Fighter pilots are given call signs with multiple meanings, often comical. “Razin” does suggest that Caine is given to bucking rank and shaking things up, precisely the qualities that delight Trump. But call signs are often ironic—like calling a skinny kid “Fats.” Caine is known as a team-oriented officer with a deep respect for the chain of command. He might be the last person in the ranks to raise hell. And the word with the droppedgis, in any case, notraisingbutrazing. It evokes Caine’s skill spearheading air assaults as a fighter pilot.\n\nHeather Penney, a retired Air Force major who flew F-16s with Caine, put it this way when I spoke with her: “Making an offensive counter air push with Razin in the lead—man, everything died in front of us. He was just so good.”\n\nCaine was awarded a fourth star just before he was sworn in as chairman. This was pro forma. Traditionally, chairmen have previously held a “combatant command” or led a branch of the military, the usual criteria for a fourth star. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs commands no troops, but Caine’s background might actually make him better suited for the top job today than many of his peers. Particularly since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq, American military action has primarily employed three sectors: air power, covert special ops, and intelligence. The attacks against Iranian nuclear sites in June certainly involved two of these and likely all of them. Here Caine has more direct experience than most four-stars. He has been providing air cover for covert or “dark” units on and off since helping to hunt Scud missiles in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. And he recently concluded three years of service as associate director for military affairs at the CIA, overseeing that agency’s relations with the Department of Defense.\n\nHis climb through the ranks was always unorthodox. He became a White House fellow in 2005–06, working for the Department of Agriculture, followed by a stint at the Homeland Security Council. Through the years that followed, he moved in and out of full-time station, partnering in business ventures while serving part-time with the National Guard and receiving steady promotions by the Air Force (Guard pilots have dual status). He is the first Air Guardsman ever to rise to chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Prior to his selection, he had retired at age 56—he called it a “graduation,” not a retirement—to become a partner in a venture-capital investment firm. By all accounts, Caine had no idea that he would soon be back in uniform, much less in the job he now holds.\n\nThe president has made many startling top-level appointments, often of people with minimal credentials and with values at sharp odds with the agencies they lead. Some of the people he has chosen seem keen mostly on the performative aspects of the job. (Hegseth is a former co-host of the weekend edition ofFox & Friends.) Caine does not fit this mold, and his selection was met with relief from the career military. He is known to be apolitical, and is genuinely liked. Where Trump is boisterous and self-aggrandizing, Caine is retiring and reflexively self-deprecating. The chairman is openly religious and prays over important decisions.\n\nThe role of chairman of the Joint Chiefs is defined by Chapter 5 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code. The chairman is strictly an “adviser.” He (there has never been a woman in the role) does not make decisions or command troops. When the chairman transmits orders to combatant commanders, he does so in the name of the president and the secretary of defense. He collects information, analyzes it, and develops recommendations for the president, the defense secretary, the National Security Council, and, importantly, Congress—which explains Caine’s contradiction of Trump in his committee testimony.\n\nThe statute makes clear that the chairman is independent. No matter how Trump has presented Caine, the general is not a political appointee or a member of the administration. When a president formally addresses Congress, his Cabinet is seated to his left in chairs that have their names engraved on the back. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is not among them. He is seated with the other service chiefs to the president’s right, by the Supreme Court justices. His advice is meant to reflect the judgment of the military alone, heedless of political or partisan considerations. Caine will find that it is hard to give advice to a man who feels he already knows best and prefers not to be contradicted.\n\nTop generals from Douglas MacArthur to George C. Marshall—though neither of them was a Joint Chiefs chairman—have found themselves snared in political disputes, sometimes of their own making. During Trump’s first term, Mark Milley was accused of both siding with the president and undercutting him. Merely disagreeing or correcting Trump is enough for the president to accuse someone of disloyalty. Telling superiors what they do not wish to hear is part of a senior military officer’s job—and one reason why Trump has rid himself of multiple generals he has been close to. Will Caine have to remind Trump that using the military against American citizens is illegal, as is using the military to arrest and deport immigrants? Trump may not want to hear that concern for civilians can impede drone strikes abroad, or that invading Greenland or Panama would violate international law. Caine told reporters it was “way too early” to assess the impact of the U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities; Trump almost certainly did not want to hear this. The conflict with Iran will evolve in ways that cannot be foreseen, and Caine may soon be presenting Trump with complex, delicate questions that disturb his fondness for simplicity.\n\n[Leon E. Panetta: The U.S. military’s loyalty is to the Constitution, not the president]\n\nIt would be hard to list all the points of potential friction in store for Caine. Trump is given to flashy displays and fancy and expensive new armaments—a new F-47 fighter jet (the “47” honors, in part, his second presidency), a “Golden Dome” of anti-missile defense for the entire country—this at a time when the military’s industrial base isincapable of meeting basic demand for munitions. Caine’s hasty elevation may also put him in the awkward position of having to deal with service chiefs and combatant commanders whom he now outranks. There is a danger, from both the Pentagon and the White House, that he will find himself sidelined. And if Trump doesn’t like what he hears from his top military adviser, he can always just stop listening—or send Caine to join Brown, Milley, Mattis, and Kelly in private life.\n\nDan Cainemight not meet some of the historic criteria for success in a Trump administration, but he does look the part—a big consideration for this president. One of Trump’s highest compliments is to describe someone as “right out of central casting,” a phrase he has used to describe Caine: a white, middle-aged male, hair flecked with gray, chest pinned with rows of service ribbons. He is fit and small, seemingly made for the snug cockpit of a fighter jet. He has dark eyes, a broad forehead, a long, prominent nose, and thin lips that curl slightly at the ends, giving him a naturally mirthful expression. He is poised, careful, and deliberate, with an arrestingly direct gaze. His manner is so deferential that, while genuine, it might lull others into underestimating him. He is generally reluctant to talk about himself, but when he gets going he is a skilled and humorous storyteller, usually making himself the butt of the joke. From his youth, he appears to have been without ambition for rank or status—among other things, his occasional detours into civilian life would usually be missteps for an officer bent on promotion.\n\nIn relating the major jumps in his career, he insists on his lack of distinction and expresses amazement at his luck.\n\nAbout his college years: a “very marginal GPA,” Caine said last year on a podcast calledAfterburn, aimed at the fighter-pilot community.\n\nAbout his first attempt to obtain a White House fellowship: “Didn’t even get an interview because I was such a marginal applicant.”\n\nAs a man who has built his career controlling powerful, complex machines, Caine has a curious way of referring to people: not as men or women or even persons, but as “humans.” His former weapons instructor is “a legendary human.” A training exercise had “world-class humans in it.” The colleagues he worked with at a National Guard test center were “world-class tacticians, leaders, thinkers, humans.”\n\nAnd as warm a human as he appears, Caine can also lapse into dense pilot-speak. Here’s how he described an early special-ops planning session: “We literally on a whiteboard sketched out what the first-ever data-link enabled, time-sensitive targeting structure might be, from the link CONOPS to roughly how we would task in a portion of air power that was set up in an air-tasking order.”\n\nCaine wanted more than anything to be a fighter pilot. He spent his childhood on American air bases around the world, watching and feeling those sleek, powerful machines thunder overhead. Caine’s father, retired Colonel Steve “Cobber” Caine, had been up there, flying the F-4 fighter in the Vietnam War, and later commanding a squadron of F-16s. He wanted one for himself. In 1990, fresh out of the Virginia Military Institute’s ROTC program, Second Lieutenant Caine was accepted for Air Force pilot training, a notoriously selective program. He learned to fly the first-level trainer T-37, a two-seat subsonic jet called “Tweety Bird,” or the “Mighty Tweet,” to distinguish it from the more challenging next-level trainer, the supersonic T-38 nicknamed “Talon.” Many trainees don’t get that far; they are routed to the Air Force’s giant fleet of transports, tankers, and reconnaissance aircraft. Caine had the skills to go all the way.\n\nBut many of the top pilots in Caine’s training class, even if they were moved up to the T-38, would never fly fighters. After Desert Storm, the U.S. military was downsizing. The Air Force had more pilots than planes. Caine foresaw that he would likely be “banked,” or held in reserve. He would earn his wings only to be given an administrative post as, say, a communications specialist or finance officer at a distant Air Force base. He would pilot a desk. Eventually, as opportunities arose, he might get an airplane, but it was just as likely that he wouldn’t.\n\nComing from an Air Force family, Caine had a better grasp of military topography than most. He knew there were available F-16s with National Guard squadrons around the country. Guard squadrons are under the jurisdiction of states; governors deploy them to respond to natural disasters or to provide a show of force during civil unrest. In the days of Caine’s apprenticeship, they mostly patrolled their state’s airspace, where they were more likely to encounter a UFO than combat, and were summoned for noisy flyovers at ceremonial events. Most Guard pilots were weekend warriors, attending college or holding down civilian jobs. They were available to be mobilized for war, but in this brief illusory moment after the collapse of communism, it seemed possible that America would never again fight one.\n\nFor a youngAir Force lieutenant on the path to fly fighters, the National Guard was a step down. But these local Guard units had F-16s. Even before finishing his Mighty Tweet training, Caine began pounding out letters and résumés on his typewriter. He sent them to every Guard unit in the country, more than 80 at the time, begging to be taken on, offering to do the most menial scutwork, to be the squadron “snacko,” the one who keeps its off-hours club supplied. He joked about it last year with John “Rain” Waters, a retired F-16 pilot who hostsAfterburn. Caine seemed slightly amazed to recall his youthful desperation and energy, typing away in his off-hours every morning and night. He said he was willing to do anything, even pleading for the snacko post, tongue only partly in cheek: “I’ve trained for this moment. There are 1,964 ounces of beer in a U.S. keg. I will never run out of popcorn.”\n\nHe used his leaves to take long road trips, pleading his case in person to every Guard unit that responded. He finally scored with the 174th Attack Wing, in Syracuse, New York, which had a last-minute opening and agreed to bring him on as an F-16 pilot. “I still can’t believe they took a risk on me,” Caine recalled on the podcast. One problem: He committed to Syracuse before he had completed his Air Force training, which, at the time, was like signing with a Triple-A ball club in Scranton while still in camp with the New York Yankees. He would need permission from his wing commander to leave active duty. A move like this was simply not done. The Air Force had invested a great deal of time and money in him, had plucked him from hundreds of wannabe fighter jocks, and it expected him to serve for at least 20 years, whether he was flying or not. Wing commanders jealously guarded the skilled pilots they had in reserve; they had quotas to keep. Now here was Lieutenant Caine, not even fully hatched, asking permission to leave. When he presented his wing commander with the request, Caine remembered, “He lost his mind and threw me out of the office. He would not sign my piece of paper and told me that I was a quitter.”\n\nHe kept trying, and eventually his commander caved. Caine is still not sure why. He considers it a lasting stroke of pure luck. The path he took is more common today, at least in part because of his example, but he finished training with what felt like a firm kick in the ass. It only hurt until he settled into the sheepskin seat of his first F-16.\n\nIt is a beautiful machine, and a joy to fly—relatively small and enormously powerful, with short swept-back wings and a tall tail fin. In flight it is so sensitive to a pilot’s hand that, as Heather Penney observed, “You think it, and the jet does it.” Despite this ease of control, pilots exit the aircraft after a flight exhausted and drenched with sweat. “Your brain has to be just miles in front of where the aircraft is,” Penney explained, “because of the speed at which you’re going and the closure rates of the tactics.”\n\nUp there at 50,000 feet, inside the frameless bubble canopy, pilots can feel like they own the world. The sky above is dark blue, the bottom of space, and below is a vista so vast that pilots can see the curvature of the Earth. Time stretches as the planet shrinks. Traveling at the jet’s top speed, Mach 2—more than 1,500 mph—a pilot in Washington, D.C., could get on the phone at noon, make a lunch date for noon in Texas, and, with the time difference, arrive early.\n\nBy 2001,Caine had completed Weapons School—the Air Force’s equivalent of the Navy’s Top Gun program—at Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada, and was flying with the National Guard’s 121st Fighter Squadron out of Andrews Air Force Base, just outside D.C. He was there on September 11, when hijacked commercial airliners flew into the World Trade Center towers, in Manhattan, and the Pentagon, in northern Virginia. Pilot Heather Penney’s call sign was “Lucky,” which played on her surname but also, she says, evoked the adage “Better lucky than good.” Women F-16 pilots are rare even today. Thirty-four years ago, she faced unveiled hostility from some of her male colleagues. Caine was not one of them. “Razin has a quiet authority about him that is based on his credibility and his knowledge,” Penney told me. “He was not egoistic. You might imagine that someone with his level of training would have been, but he was incredibly humble.”\n\nThat sunny morning in September, the attacks came literally out of the blue. In the first hour, there was no knowing what would happen next. And, in fact, a fourth hijacked airliner, United 93, was now bearing south toward Washington. What was to be done about it? The 121st Fighter Squadron was not one of the Guard’s four designated “alert units” in the country. The missiles the F-16s would have carried weren’t even assembled. Their machine guns were loaded with nonexplosive training rounds. Lieutenant Colonel Marc Sasseville, the squadron’s commander, ordered Caine and his wingman, Brandon Rasmussen, to wait for missiles to be assembled and loaded onto their fighters before taking off. Sasseville chose Penney to fly her plane on his own wing, and the two of them ran to their unarmed jets and took off, bent on intercepting any planes that might enter the capital’s restricted airspace. Their options for stopping one were near suicidal. As Sasseville assessed it, they could shoot their training rounds and pray that they hit a fuel tank and caused a spark to ignite it. If they strafed the cockpit they might hit the hijacker pilot, but the airliner could still be controllable and a threat.\n\n“I really needed to make it stop flying,” he told me. “And the only way to do that was to ram it and break a wing off it; then it would disintegrate in the air. The risk of surviving that, in my estimation, was low, because I’m not aware of anybody who’s ever tried. So my idea was to have one hand on the stick guiding the airplane towards the wing root with the other hand on the ejection handle.”\n\nAs it happened, before Sasseville and Penney even took off, United 93’s passengers had attacked their hijackers and sent the plane crashing into the Pennsylvania countryside, killing everyone aboard. But no one in the 121st Fighter Squadron knew that. All four pilots had faced the lasting horror of having to contemplate bringing down a commercial airliner in flight, perhaps suicidally. It hadn’t been necessary, but the scenario became the pilots’ legacy, and made them famous in their community.\n\nIn early 2003,before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a secret American air base was established in eastern Jordan. During the first Gulf War, a decade earlier, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had fired Soviet-designed Scud missiles at Israel. This time around, the plan was to destroy Saddam’s Scuds before the fighting started and Caine, in addition to flying his F-16 on attack missions, was the project officer. To execute it, he had worked closely with the special-ops teams for almost a year.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vinnie Savino’s 38th Air Force Rescue Squadron had been one of the first on the ground at the base in eastern Jordan. His unit had 25 airmen to start. After they helped build out the old Jordanian airfield to suit the needs of a continuing U.S. operation, the 38th settled into a hangar at the far end of the flight line. They had a ringside seat as the warplanes began to arrive, screaming down to land and taxiing to the far end of the runway, where the headquarters were. This was the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing, the fliers Savino’s unit would have to go find if they bailed out inside Iraq.\n\nIn general, tech sergeants do not mingle with fighter pilots, so Savino was surprised when Dan Caine showed up at his hangar, just to get to know the unit. Then he brought the other pilots in his wing—“guys and gals,” said Savino, approvingly. Together Caine and Savino planned a “monster mash,” a grueling running and training exercise meant to simulate the conditions of a rescue. Savino recalled the kinds of questions he asked Caine and the other pilots.\n\nIf you eject and make it to the ground, do you just get up and run?\n\nThey discussed the likely terrain, and then the pilots were sent off to run several miles in their gear through land that might resemble it.\n\nWhat if your co-pilot or wingman is injured?\n\nThey practiced emergency first aid.\n\nWhat kind of weapon will you have?\n\nPilots carried 9 mm pistols.\n\nWhat if you have a broken arm? How are you going to cock your weapon?\n\nThey were shown how to cock a pistol with their heel.\n\nOne day in 2005,Mike Johanns, then the secretary of agriculture, spotted a new face outside his office.\n\n“What do you do here?” Johanns asked a 37-year-old Dan Caine.\n\n“Anything you want, Mr. Secretary.”\n\nCaine, then a lieutenant colonel, had succeeded in winning a White House fellowship on his second try, and was assigned to the USDA, an agency he knew little about and had never expected to join. “Well, come with me,” said Johanns. They were driven in the secretary’s car to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, built in the French Second Empire style, immediately west of the White House. Caine followed Johanns into an elevator, which quickly filled with famous faces. There was Andy Card, the president’s chief of staff, and Vice President Dick Cheney with his Secret Service agents. “I’m just shrinking into the back of the elevator, hoping that no one will say anything to me,” Caine told Waters in theAfterburninterview, describing his year with the USDA.\n\nThe George W. Bush administration was starting to dissect the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, which had devastated New Orleans, killed an estimated 1,800 people, and caused massive flood damage in three southern states. The administration had been widely criticized for its slow response. Now it was going to study what went wrong and how to be better prepared. Caine was given the job of reverse-engineering the USDA’s response to the disaster.\n\nIf there is a single trait that defines a good F-16 pilot, it is the ability to monitor and process a dizzying flow of data from a variety of cockpit screens, and to react quickly. Caine was now soliciting data from a department with more than 100,000 employees and eight major divisions. Many functions were in play during a national disaster. He pulled together the information and then briefed his boss. Mike Johanns gave Caine additional responsibility, which generated pushback. Johanns recalled, “I actually had a staff person come to me while Dan was with us and say, ‘You know, Mr. Secretary, you’ve given him so much authority here, and keep in mind that he’s just a White House fellow.’” The staffer pointed out that Caine was very young, very inexperienced, and very temporary. The secretary was unmoved. “He was just so capable,” Johanns told me.\n\nPeople also tend to trust Caine. “I think the way I would describe it is: If you would’ve talked to the director of the CIA, he would’ve told you that Dan was his guy,” said General Jim Slife, who was fired by Trump as Air Force vice chief of staff this past February, in an interview. “And if you would’ve talked to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs or the secretary of defense, they would tell you that Dan was their guy. It’s just that Dan was able to understand and empathize with each of the parties and communicate in a way that made them understand that he knew what their equities were and he was fighting for their equities. I don’t mean that in any way as a put-down. I mean, I think that’s graduate-level interpersonal skills.”\n\nTrump had anagenda on that trip to Iraq’s al-Asad Air Base in 2018. A sizable American force was still in the area, seven years after U.S. combat operations had officially ended. Trump had announced a week before his visit thathe was going to withdraw all of the U.S. forces in Syria and half in Afghanistan. This conflicted with the Pentagon’s advice—doing so would be dangerously premature and betray our allies—and Secretary of Defense Mattis resigned. At that point, the fight was focused on the remnants of ISIS in Syria. There was also the ongoing effort by a variety of factions—often at war with each other—to oust the dictator Bashar al-Assad. The American mission was primarily to assist one of these factions, the Syrian Democratic Forces, which was doing most of the fighting against ISIS on the ground. Knotted up in this were relations with Russia, Iran, Israel, Turkey, and other powers. Trump is notoriously intolerant of complexity. He regards expertise as hidebound thinking. He came looking for a simpler solution.\n\n[From the October 2019 issue: Why did James Mattis resign as defense secretary?]\n\nAs a precaution during its approach to al-Asad—an active war zone—Air Force One had turned off its lights. This irritated the president. “We spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we can’t land a plane with the lights on 20 years later?” he asked a CPAC audience in 2019, prompting laughter and applause. “How bad is it? No, seriously, how bad is it? How bad is it? Seven trillion dollars, and we have to fly in with no lights.” That was his frame of mind when he met with the frontline commanders. Caine was now a general, but one of the lower-ranking ones in attendance. In the years since working in Washington, he had been in and out of active duty, involved with several business start-ups. Now he was deputy to General Paul LaCamera, who headed the Special Operations Joint Task Force. Caine was also, because of his experience as a White House fellow, probably more comfortable addressing a president than others in the room. After describing in that 2019 speech how he had learned Caine’s name, Trump went on to elaborate:\n\nSo I have Razin Caine, three other generals, colonels, sergeants … And I said to the generals, “Listen, we got to get out. I want to know why is it going to take two years to knock off 2 or 3 or 4 percent [of ISIS], which is what we had left.”\n\n“It won’t, sir.”\n\nAnd I said, “Tell me why it won’t.”\n\n“It won’t, sir. If we attack them in a different manner, we can do it much faster.”\n\n“Okay, General Razin Caine, how fast can—”\n\n“Sir, we can have it totally finished in one week.”\n\nI said, “One week? I was told two years.” [Laughter.] “One week?”\n\n“That’s right, sir. We’re only hitting them from a temporary base in Syria. But if you gave us permission, we could hit them from the back, from the side, from all over—from the base that you’re right on, right now, sir. They won’t know what the hell hit them.” [Applause.] “They won’t know what the hell hit them, sir.”\n\nAnd I said, “Why didn’t my other generals tell me that? Why didn’t they tell me that?” I said, “Did you tell them that?”\n\n“Not our place to say it, sir. They come in from Washington, sir. We have to take orders. You’re the first one to ask us our opinion.” [More applause.]\n\nIt’s true. It’s true. True. True.\n\nIt wasn’t. The set-up was one of Trump’s standard tropes—the commonsense, inspired leader beset by elite nincompoops who plucks a like-minded soul from the lower ranks—and the account was false. Other sources familiar with the meeting, though reluctant to challenge Trump’s account in public, say that Caine did not act or speak the way Trump said he did. He did answer Trump’s questions, but not about the U.S. effort in general. He was presenting a plan of attack for a single ISIS location, which he was confident could be destroyed rapidly. He did not offer an opinion about the overall operation, nor did he imply that the effort was somehow hamstrung by official limitations. Nothing Caine explained to the president differed from what the others in the room understood. And the upshot of the meeting was that the assembled generals, including Caine, persuaded the president that any sudden withdrawal of American troops would be against U.S. interests, a gift to ISIS, and a betrayal of trusted allies. The forces were not withdrawn. Today, seven years later, thousands of American troops are still supporting the effort to destroy what remains of ISIS in Syria.\n\nNone of this apparently made a dent in Trump’s memory, or in his impression of Caine. In his 2024 retelling, here were his exact words about that initial encounter with Caine, after he asked for the general’s name.\n\nAnd he gave me his name.\n\n“What’s your name, sergeant?”\n\n“Yes, sir. I love you, sir. I think you’re great, sir. I’ll kill for you, sir.”\n\nThen he puts on a Make America Great Again hat. You’re not allowed to do that, but they did it. I remember I went into the hangar, and there were a lot of—hundreds of troops. And they’re not supposed to do this, but they all put on the Make America Great Again hat, right? Not supposed to do it. I said, “You’re not supposed to do that. You know that.”\n\nThey said, “It’s okay, sir. We don’t care.”\n\nIt’s easy to see why reports of these remarks were confused. Trump’s fluid rhetorical style is, perhaps deliberately, tough to pin down. Note the ever-shifting focus: asking for Caine’s name, then a reference to “he,” then to “sergeant,” then to “they,” and then back to “general.” A close reading shows that Trump was not putting the MAGA hat on Caine, but rather on an unnamed sergeant. Still, Trump never clarified the matter, or perhaps never cared to, and after the general’s appointment was announced,Politico’s headline read: “MAGA Hat Drama Could Taint Trump’s Top Military Advisor Pick.”The Daily Beast’s headline read: “Trump Makes MAGA Hat-Wearing ‘Killer’ Chairman of Joint Chiefs.”\n\nWhen asked about the inaccuracy of Trump’s recollections, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: “General Caine successfully helped President Trump obliterate ISIS in just a few weeks in his first term after Obama had called it a ‘generational threat’ we just have to live with, and then he oversaw one of the most secretive and perfectly successful operations in U.S. history—obliterating Iran’s nuclear facilities.” Caine declined to comment for this story.\n\nAll of this landedDan Caine in a touchy spot. He was both beneficiary and victim of Trump’s story—a story that, to officers of his grade, made him look like a toady, if not a buffoon. But how do you deny and publicly embarrass the president who has just raised you from obscurity to the nation’s highest military office?\n\nThis is what Trump does: He creates brands. He has had great success doing it for himself, but the brand Trump created for Caine was a bad fit. The general did what he could to discard it during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, in April.\n\n“Let me just start out by asking you about some hyperbole that may have been out there in the press,” said the committee chairman, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi. “General Caine, did you wear a MAGA hat in front of the president?”\n\nCaine said simply, “No, sir.”\n\n“Did you wear a MAGA hat at any time?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\n“Okay, would you like to elaborate on that answer?”\n\n“Sir, for 34 years I’ve upheld my oath of office and my commitment to my commission, and I have never worn any political merchandise.”\n\nConcerned about Trump’s tendency to stretch his authority beyond legal limits, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona asked, “To whom or what do you swear an oath?”\n\n“Senator, as I have for 34 years, it’s to the Constitution,” Caine said.\n\nHe was asked repeatedly if he was willing to tell the president things he didn’t want to hear.\n\n“Senator, I think that’s the most important part of this job,” he told Mike Rounds of South Dakota.\n\n“It ultimately is the whole job,” he told Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.\n\nSince Caine became chairman, there have been air strikes in Yemen and Somalia. American troops remain engaged on the ground in Syria, have continued to supply Ukraine, and are present in large numbers in East Asia and the Middle East. In June, Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities and other targets, leading to an outright state of war—one that the U.S. joined with Operation Midnight Hammer, in which American B-2 bombers dropped the most powerful conventional bombs in the U.S. arsenal on three nuclear sites in Iran. At home, the White House has pushed to use military force against domestic protests—efforts that so far have resulted in a highly publicized presence but no real action. The president and his chairman have lots to talk about.\n\nBy all accounts, Caine is giving straight professional advice. He seems to prefer doing so in private, although when called on to comment publicly he hasn’t ducked. If things don’t go as he might wish, he is unlikely to resign, protest, or publicly criticize the president—it is not his way. If Trump tires of listening to him, if he is fired in the usual hail of abuse, regard for him at the Pentagon—the world that for Caine matters most—will not suffer. He has spent most of his military career working in the shadows, with units who brand themselves “quiet professionals.” Unlike many of his predecessors, he hasn’t held a routine press conference and has mostly refused requests for interviews. His inclination is to make himself as invisible as possible. He would like to avoid becoming the story himself, as some of his immediate predecessors have done.\n\nThen Caine was drafted into a June 26 press conference that Trump touted as a “fight for the Dignity of our Great American Pilots.” Caine appeared at the Pentagon with a testy Hegseth, who scolded journalists for covering an initial intelligence assessment of the operation—that the strikes set back Iran’s nuclear program only by a matter of months—and for not being sufficiently grateful to men and women in uniform. Caine followed Hegseth’s rant with a technical review of the bombings, blue marker and laser pointer in hand, and a heartfelt tribute to the “awesome humans” who prepared for 15 years for an operation like Midnight Hammer. At one point, Caine put his listeners in the boots of Patriot missile crews who were charged with neutralizing Iran’s retaliation on U.S. forces in Qatar.\n\n“It’s hot, you’re getting nervous, and you expect an attack,” Caine said, seeming to relish the opportunity to transmit the experiences of soldiers. Then your crew “turns a key and relinquishes control of those missiles to that young lieutenant inside the vehicle. And you wait. You know that you’re going to have approximately two minutes—120 seconds—to either succeed, or fail.”\n\nEspecially in contrast with Hegseth, Caine was “almost lyrical,” according toThe New York Times. The tone of the press conference was good-cop, bad-cop—so much so that the Reuters journalist Idrees Ali asked Caine if he had been “pressured” by Trump or Hegseth to give “a more rosy intelligence assessment.”\n\n“I’ve never been pressured by the president or the secretary to do anything other than tell them exactly what I’m thinking,” Caine replied, “and that’s exactly what I’ve done.”\n\nUnlike his congressional testimony earlier in June, in which Caine contradicted the president, at the press conference he was on message, taking Hegseth’s cue to focus on the soldiers, not on whether Midnight Hammer had been a true success.\n\nThe oath sworn by all U.S. military officers states that “I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter.” In other words, Caine is obligated to obey lawful orders. He does not make political decisions. He may refuse an unlawful order and argue that point in his defense if he is court-martialed, but he is duty bound to carry out all others, whether he agrees with them or not, even if they directly contradict his advice, even if he believes they are harmful to the country, even if he believes they are immoral. As Joint Chiefs chairman, Caine is required to convey the president’s orders, but there is nothing to stop him from noting his disagreement—in-house, if not publicly. This would be a quick way of provoking Trump’s ire, but Caine told the senators he was prepared to be dismissed from the job if the president didn’t like his advice. He did not seek the position. Trump came looking for him.\n\nSenator Kelly again: “If necessary, will you choose the right thing to do? Even if it is hard over the easier wrong option?”\n\n“Senator, I’ve always strived to do the right thing, and that’s not going to change now.”\n\nLess likely but also possible would be resistance from inside the Pentagon. Caine can relay the orders of the president and the secretary of defense, but there’s no guarantee that the instructions will be instantly obeyed. The service chiefs and combatant commanders who recently outranked him, and who command troops, might not bend. This would not necessarily amount to a public refusal; it could be accomplished by delays or failure to aggressively follow through. For example, the military has obligingly been taking down portraits and scrubbing its websites and curricula of Black and female faces, DEI language, and inclusive initiatives, but decisions about promoting or assigning personnel in the military’s million-plus ranks remain with lower-ranking commanders. While by no means color or gender blind, the military has been and will remain the most integrated institution in America. It is doubtful that orders from Trump’s White House will dramatically alter its culture.\n\nIf Trump or Hegseth, through Caine, push policies that top commanders consider unlawful or unwise, they may well be greeted with generous lip service and stubborn inaction. More likely, Caine would convey his objections to the White House himself, ready to be shown the door. For now, though, the president has thanked Caine by name—nickname, too—calling him “spectacular” after the bombing mission against Iran.\n\nThere are two schools of thought about how long this will last. Some who know Caine predict that his tenure will be rocky and short. Others believe that his remarkable social skills might see him through to the end of Trump’s presidency. He seems prepared either way. The real test might come if Caine is asked to lie, or to embrace one of Trump’s exaggerations. The president tests his subordinates this way. The supposed “obliteration” of Iran’s nuclear program—an assertion not yet backed by evidence—was one such test, which Hegseth passed but Caine sidestepped during the June 26 press conference. Will the chairman keep evading such a test, and for how long?\n\nCaine exited his first military job—happily—with a swift verbal kick from his commander. No one will be surprised if his last military job ends the same way.\n\nThis article originally stated, incorrectly, that the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, and National Guard command troops. It also misstated that Dan Caine left active duty to become a White House fellow, and that he commanded the CIA's secret missions.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

    "News_title":"Elon Musk Has A Plan To Keep Civilization From Collapsing. There's 1 Little Problem...",
    "News_text":"I raised my daughter on disability income, food stamps, and the generosity of friends and family who accepted home-cooked meals for helping me instead of cash. I didn’t have a partner or a safety net. What I had was determination, exhaustion, and the constant fear of falling further behind.\n\nSo when I see billionaires like Elon Musk telling the world tohave more kids or civilization will collapse, I want to scream.\n\nIt’s not that people don’t want families, it’s that we’re drowning in a system that makes them impossible to afford.\n\nIn the three years after my daughter was born, I lost five jobs — not because I wasn’t capable or committed but because I couldn’t always secure reliable child care. Eventually, a close friend stepped in and agreed to watch her for $30 a day and two home-cooked meals each week. That arrangement helped, but it came after we’d already lost everything. With no money and nowhere to go, my daughter and I moved into a spare room in my best friend’s home. We slept in a bunk bed and tried to piece our lives back together.\n\nEventually, I did what so many parents do: I powered through. We moved south of Denver, and I landed a job that allowed us to climb out of the worst of it. For a while, it felt like we were finally moving forward. That is, until I was hit with devastating news about my health and had to go on Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nSuddenly, we were back to scraping by, this time on just $1,200 a month, with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and Medicaid keeping us afloat.\n\nThere were times I had to choose between paying for food and keeping the car insured. Other times, we couldn’t afford rent and had to stay with family. But I always made sure my daughter had access to what she needed: three meals a day, an orchestra program, and a spot on the color guard. Those opportunities only happened because of public assistance and programs designed to catch people like us before we fell too far.\n\nWithout them, she wouldn’t have had any of it. And I know we’re not alone.\n\nI’ve lived at the intersection of poverty, parenthood and disability. And that’s not just a fork in the road — it’s a carving knife of reality.\n\nI’ve stood in food pantry lines, hoping there’d be a few items left. I’ve skipped meals to make sure my daughter had enough. I’ve felt the shame of judgment from strangers and even family — people who assume that if you need help, you’re either lazy, irresponsible or both.\n\nPeople think single parents live some glamorous sitcom life, but no one shows the scenes where you’re crying over the stove because you can’t afford gas and groceries in the same week. No one shows the trade-offs: the birthday gifts skipped, the medical care delayed, the emotional toll of trying to hold it all together when you’re running on fumes.\n\nAnd then here comes Elon Musk, telling us to have more kids.\n\nIt’s easy to say from inside a mansion filled with nannies. It’s easy to tell people to repopulate the world when you’ve never had to decide between medication and milk. But Musk’s version of “save civilization” sounds a lot like “keep producing children so the labor force stays full,” without making a single change to support the people actually doing the raising.\n\nWe’re raising kids in a world where survival costs more than it ever did. And some of us are trying to avoid dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant; so no, we’re not lining up to have baby number three just because a billionaire thinks it’s our civic duty.\n\nBut Musk’s fantasy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It echoes throughout Washington, D.C., where conservatives are gutting the very programs that kept my daughter and me alive.\n\nRepublicans just passed their so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid and SNAP programs that millions of Americans, myself included, rely on to survive.\n\nNow that it’s passed, I could lose my eligibility for a kidney transplant. Without Medicaid to supplement my Medicare, I can’t afford the out-of-pocket costs for necessary care and medications. I’ve already had to delay seeing my nephrologist because one safety net was ripped out from under me with only a month’s notice. I can’t imagine what will happen if the rest disappears.\n\nAnd it’s not just me. This will devastate seniors, babies, children, disabled folks, working families, and the communities that already carry too much. Hunger will increase. Local aid programs will definitely be overwhelmed. Hospitals will close. People will die. And what are Republicans getting in exchange? More Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. More billionaires with bigger bank accounts. More cruelty disguised as fiscal responsibility.\n\nBut let’s be honest, these lawmakers are not building a stronger economy. They’re gutting the weak to appease the rich. They’re treating human beings like budget line items. If you don’t contribute enough to their campaign coffers, they don’t care if you live or die.\n\nThis is not a broken system; it’s a functioning machine of economic violence, operated by people who only punch down and call it policy.\n\nSo no, Elon and Republicans, we don’t need more lectures about fertility. We need leadership that values and cares for the people already here!\n\nIf you really cared about families, you’d be fighting for universal child care, health care, housing and food security, not stripping them away. You’d be making sure parents had one less thing to fear, not 10 more.\n\nUntil then? Spare us the speeches. And keep your bootstraps. We can’t even afford the damn boots.\n\nJ.

    "News_text":"Spain’sfar-Right party Voxhas vowed to deport around eight million people if it wins the next election.\n\nThis week, party leaders said they wanted to remove all people of foreign origin who have not adopted Spanish customs – a shift from their previous position of only deporting those in the country illegally.\n\nRocío de Meer, Vox’s spokeswoman for demographic emergency and social policies, said the policy would mean expelling “millions of people who have recently come to our country and have not adapted to our customs”.\n\nMore than seven million people could be eligible for what she called “re-emigration”, Ms de Meer said on Monday.\n\n“Of our country’s 47 million inhabitants, roughly seven million – or more than seven million, because we have to take into account the second generation – eight million are people who have come from different origins in a very short period of time,” she said.\n\n“It is therefore extraordinarily difficult for them to adapt to our ways and customs.”\n\nVox is Spain’s third-largest political force, having won 12 per cent of the vote in the2023 general election. It has since been polling slightly higher.\n\nMeanwhile, the Left-wing minority government of Pedro Sánchez isteetering on the brink of collapse, unable to legislate and mired in allegations of corruption.\n\nAlberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the opposition conservative People’s Party, said last weekend that he would discussa political agreement with Voxif he did not win an outright majority, although he said he did not like coalition governments.\n\nAt a party gathering last month Vox presented a policy document that included a proposal for “mass deportations”, with MP Carlos Hernández citing research suggesting that by 2045 “Spaniards will be a minority in our own country”.\n\nForeigners currently make up 14 per cent of the Spanish population, with 9.4 million people who were born outside the country.\n\nSantiago Abascal, Vox’s leader, said on Tuesday said that he was unsure how many people would be deported if the party came to power. “We don’t know how many – when we get into government, we will know,” he added.\n\nThe Vox leader listed the kind of people he said should be deported, including “all those who come here to commit crimes ... impose a foreign religion ...abuse or disrespect women[and] live off the efforts of others”.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Opinion - The PEPFAR industry has launched a hysterical campaign against accountability",
    "News_text":"A majorcampaignis underway to overturn administration cuts to global HIV\/AIDS funding, with claims that such cuts are killing millions of people, causing global turmoil, and advancing China’s global agenda.\n\nThat sounds grave. Fortunately, it’s completely untrue.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, the White House ordereda 90-day pauseto review all U.S. foreign aid. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubiocharacterizedsome aid as “counterproductive to American interests, wasting taxpayer money and provoking resentment abroad.”\n\nRubio was right. Foreign aid had gone “off the ideological rails” by supporting progressive agendas — something that has earned it the rebuke ofCongress.\n\nThe aid pause generated ire in proponents of the$6.5 billion annualPresident’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief or PEPFAR, a U.S. government program launched in 2003 when Africa faced an out-of-control AIDS epidemic. A powerfulcoalitionof NGOs, churches, contractors, foundations, universities, and pharmaceutical companies have coalesced in a lobbying campaign to shame Republican legislators into rejecting any cuts to the program whatsoever.\n\nOnly two months into the aid freeze, U2 rock star Bonoclaimedthat “300,000 people have already died.”  Bill Gates, a major global AIDS benefactor, warned of “millions”dyingif cuts are not reversed. UNAIDS predicts4 milliondeaths per year by 2030.\n\nIt gets worse. Former USAID administrator Andrew Natsioswarnedfreezing aid “is going to destabilize countries” and force them to go “to China.”\n\nBut all these charges are false claims, designed only to scare lawmakers into restoring their annual funding levels.\n\nIt has been six months since the administration’s review began, and there is no news from PEPFAR-funded countries that thousands have been dying from aid cuts.\n\nNor have aid cuts caused global collapse. South Africa, the top PEPFAR recipient,declared, “it is inconceivable …[that aid cuts] will lead to a collapse of the entire programme.”\n\nUnder Trump, no African country has imploded. In contrast there werecoups d’etatduring the Biden administration.\n\nInstead, in a welcoming development, Africans are takingownershipto care for their own people and reduce dependency on foreign taxpayers.\n\nEqually absurd isthe oft-repeated chargethat cuts in global HIV funding will cause them to turn to China. In fact, 19 of the top 20 recipients of U.S. foreign aid were already members of China’s Belt and Road Initiative before any of this. Among them, last year, Mozambique and Tanzania hostedjoint military exerciseswith China’s navy, and South Africa is the S in theBRICSalliance created by China in 2009 to undercut U.S. global leadership.\n\nThese are three of the top four PEPFAR recipients. Clearly, these issues are unrelated.\n\nThe real driver of this campaign is the foreign aid industry, which currently stands to lose billions in taxpayer funding. Both theU.S. Senateand theHouse of Representativesrecently ripped the foreign aid industry for its high overhead charges, which sometimes exceed 50 percent of their total grants.\n\nRepublican lawmakers considering this manufactured hysteria must be made to understand that 98 percent ofpolitical donationsfrom the PEPFAR industry go to Democrats. Know that a big chunk of that $6.5 billion annual congressional gift is being used against your re-election campaign.\n\nThe Gates Foundation’s global AIDS work is admirable, but it relies on large U.S. governmentco-financing. Aid advocate ONE Campaign, founded by Bono a year after PEPFAR’s launch, received$40 millionfrom the Gates Foundation. Forty percent of UNAIDS budget is covered by the U.S. government.\n\nPEPFAR is big business and a career to many.\n\nPEPFAR has also saved millions of lives. But it is an emergency program— that’s what the “E” in PEPFAR stands for — created in response to a crisis in Africa. Twenty-three years and $125 billion later, some would have it become a global entitlement program in perpetuity.\n\nLike so many entitlement programs, domestic and foreign, PEPFAR spending spawned an industry heavily vested in its self-perpetuation that is now rife with waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Embassy in Zambia announced $50 million in aid cuts after finding that HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria drug donations had been systematicallypilferedby government officials for years and resold by corrupt pharmacies. In 2020, USAID found large-scalefraudby Kenya’s state-run medical supplies company involving hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of antiretroviral drugs. The Global Fund against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria is similarly dogged by corruptionscandals.\n\nDuring these scandals PEPFAR lobby did not issue a single peep about thousands dying as a result.\n\nAnd add government incompetence to the mix as well. Recently, a $9.5 billion global health supply chain contract, intended to be the U.S. government’s backbone to support poor countries,collapsedafter years of planning. Now, no system exists to maximize delivery efficiencies of billions of dollars’ worth of medicine.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Center for Disease Control reported that PEPFAR funds illegally funded abortions in Mozambique, confirming African leaders’accusationsof widespread abuse. That prompted PEPFAR supporter Senator Jim Risch tofume, “this violation means the future of the PEPFAR program is certainly in jeopardy.”\n\nThankfully, PEPFAR has also created an African cadre of experts that can operate HIV programs themselves—without the bureaucratic bloat of the PEPFAR industry. By working directly with African churches, which are the core of medical care in Africa (as in the U.S.), Congress could cut PEPFAR’s cost by half, improve delivery effectiveness through local partners, and empower Africans to take ownership of a program that should be transitioned to them anyway.\n\nThat is the PEPFAR industry’s worst-case scenario.\n\nMax Primorac is a Senior Research Fellow in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Seeing war through the lens of narcissism",
    "News_text":"We usually think of narcissism as a personal flaw — a grandiose ego, a craving for attention, a lack of empathy. But what if narcissism is not just a diagnosis, but a lens? A way of understanding how individuals — and even entire nations — cope with wounds too painful to face directly?\n\nThis question came alive for me during a conversation with two Ukrainian army veterans, Andriy and Bohdan, who wereundergoing rehabilitationin the U.S. through an organization calledLimbs for Liberty. Andry had lost an arm, Bohdan a leg. Despite their physical injuries, their spirits were remarkably intact — sharp, humorous, and deeply reflective.\n\nWhen they learned I was preparing to speak at a conference in Lviv, Ukraine, on the psychological dimensions of narcissism, they became animated.\n\n“Like Rambo,” Andry said with a laugh. He wasn’t joking. He went on to explain that Rambo — Hollywood’s invulnerable action hero — was more than a character. He was a symbol.\n\nInstead of mourning or questioning the trauma, the culture transformed the wounded soldier into an unstoppable killing machine. “That’s individual narcissism,” Andry said. “You get hurt, but instead of feeling it, you become stronger — on the outside.”\n\nBohdan nodded, then added, “And collective narcissism—that’s the presidents.” He wasn’t speaking in generalities. He mentionedVladimir Putinand, in a different context,Donald Trump.\n\nBoth, he said, had mastered the art of turning collective wounds into mythology.\n\nIn Russia’s case, thecollapse of the Soviet Unionleft a profound psychic scar. Putin called it “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century.” Rather than acknowledge the grief or confusion that followed, the Kremlin built a story: Russia as eternal, misunderstood, betrayed by the West.\n\nRead also:Russian regime’s legitimacy rests on the manipulation of history\n\nUkraine, in this myth, is not a sovereign country with its own voice, but a misbehaving child of a once-mighty empire. In this view, aspirations toward democracy are not signs of agency but threats to stability. Cultural independence becomes treason. Reality is bent in service of an identity that cannot bear to feel humiliated or forgotten.\n\nThis is collective narcissism: the projection of weakness outward, the denial of vulnerability inward. It builds national pride not on self-knowledge, but on fantasy. The result is a fragile strength, a defensive posture that lashes out rather than reflects.\n\nIn the United States, the wound is different, but the mechanism often echoes the same pattern. Donald Trump’s promise to “Make America Great Again” was not just a slogan — it was a narrative balm for people who felt abandoned, disoriented, or invisible in a changing world.\n\nThe nostalgia embedded in that phrase isn’t necessarily a longing for policy — it’s a longing for supremacy, clarity, and simplicity. It’s the same impulse to cover over pain with projection: to blame others, to romanticize the past, to reject complexity.\n\nNarcissism, whether personal or collective, doesn’t begin in arrogance. It begins in pain. A wound that feels too dangerous to name — too humiliating to acknowledge — gets buried. And what grows over it is a mask: invincibility, righteousness, exceptionalism.\n\nBut the pain doesn’t disappear. It distorts. And it demands constant maintenance.\n\nSo, how do we heal? What’s the alternative?\n\nWhat struck me most about Andry and Bohdan wasn’t their insight — it wastheir freedom. They didn’t need to be Rambo. They could laugh about the myth without denying their pain. They could talk about national leaders and their projections without losing faith in their country. They were wounded, but not hardened. Broken, but not bitter.\n\nIn Ukraine, I’ve seen a kind of cultural resilience that doesn’t rely on fantasy. People write poetry about loss, gather in liturgies that name sorrow, and rebuild even in the midst of grief. Their strength doesn’t come from pretending not to be hurt. It comes from facing pain head-on and refusing to let it define the future.\n\nIn the Christian tradition, there’s a word for this: transformation. Not through domination or denial, but through truth-telling, mourning, and imagination. The wounded Christ is not hidden from view but held up for the world to see — not as spectacle, but as testimony.\n\nIn this vision, healing is not a return to former glory, but a movement toward wholeness. Not power over others, but communion with them.\n\nCollective narcissism tempts us to craft identities out of denial. It thrives on stories of victimhood that never admit weakness. But genuine healing — national or personal — requires something much harder: the courage to feel pain, the humility to learn from it, and the imagination to build something new from its ashes.\n\nAndry and Bohdan reminded me of this — not with theory, but with their lives. True strength, they showed me, isn’t about looking like Rambo. It’s about knowing you don’t have to.\n\nEditor’s Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent.\n\nSubmit an Opinion\n\nRead also:‘Some are forged into poets during hostilities’ — Medic, former POW, and poet on how war is shaping Ukraine’s writers\n\nWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent, locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

    "News_title":"Analysis-US, Israel diverge on how to pursue Iran endgame after strikes, diplomats say",
    "News_text":"By Samia Nakhoul\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) -When they met on Monday, U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpand Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basked in the glow of their triumph over Iran. But the show of unity masked a divergence over their endgames in Iran, Gaza and the wider Middle East.\n\nBoth leaders have touted the success of last month’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, declaring they had set back a programme they say is aimed at acquiring a nuclear bomb.\n\nYet, with intelligence assessments suggesting that Iran retains a hidden stockpile of enriched uranium and the technical capacity to rebuild, both Trump and Netanyahu know that their victory is more short-term than strategic, two diplomats say.\n\nWhere they diverge is on how to further pressure Iran, the diplomats said. Trump says his priority is to lean on diplomacy, pursuing a limited objective of ensuring Iran never develops a nuclear weapon - a goal Tehran has always denied pursuing.\n\nIn contrast, Netanyahu wants to use more force, a source familiar with the Israeli leader’s thinking said, compelling Tehran -- to the point of government collapse if necessary -- into fundamental concessions on quitting a nuclear enrichment programme seen by Israel as an existential threat.\n\nThe divide over Iran echoes the situation in the Gaza Strip.\n\nTrump, eager to cast himself as a global peacemaker, is pushing for a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Palestinian territory, but the contours of any post-war deal remain undefined and the endgame uncertain.\n\nNetanyahu, while publicly endorsing ceasefire talks, says he is committed to the total dismantling of Hamas, a strategic ally of Iran. The Israeli prime minister wants the remaining Hamas leadership deported, possibly to Algeria -- a demand Hamas flatly rejects. The gap between a temporary pause and a lasting resolution remains wide, two Middle East officials say.\n\nOn Iran, Netanyahu was displeased to see Washington revive nuclear talks with Tehran expected in Norway this week, the first diplomatic overture since the strikes, said the person familiar with his thinking. He opposes any move that could give the Iranian authorities an economic and political lifeline.\n\nTHE LIBYA MODEL\n\nNetanyahu wants nothing less than the Libya model for Iran, the source said. That means Iran fully dismantling its nuclear and missile facilities under strict oversight, and renouncing uranium enrichment on its soil even for civilian needs.\n\nIsrael is seeking not diplomacy but regime change, Western and regional officials have said. And Netanyahu knows he needs at least a green light from the White House -- if not direct backing -- to carry out further operations if Tehran refuses to relinquish its nuclear ambitions, they said.\n\nBut Trump has different objectives, the diplomats said. After the June strikes, he sees an opportunity to press Iran to cut a deal and seize a grand diplomatic feat of restoring ties with Iran that has long eluded him, the diplomats said.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said he would like to lift sanctions on Iran at some point. And in an eye-catching post on X suggesting Tehran sees economic ties as a potential element in any deal, President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believed American investors can come to Iran with \"no obstacles to their activities\".\n\nIranian rulers, however, face two unpalatable options: renewed strikes if they do not surrender their nuclear ambitions and humiliation at home if they do. That means they may try to make talks drag out, unwilling to fully quit their nuclear project and presenting a difficulty for a U.S. president impatient for a deal and its economic benefits for the U.S., Western and regional officials say.\n\nFor Israel, the fallback option is clear, the person familiar with Netanyahu's thinking said: a policy of sustained containment through periodic strikes to prevent any nuclear resurgence. In the wake of its air war against Iran, Israel has reasserted itself as the region's unrivalled military power, more willing than ever to use force and more capable of doing so with precision and relative impunity.\n\nWashington, meanwhile, is hedging its bets. While Israeli and U.S. hawks still hope for regime change in Tehran, Trump appears unwilling to shoulder the huge military, political and economic costs that such a project would demand.\n\nTrump rapidly claimed victory after the U.S. attack. And while he has said he would consider bombing Iran again if it continued to enrich uranium to worrisome levels, he has portrayed the June 22 operation as a bold, surgical one-off.\n\nNO BOOTS ON THE GROUND\n\nHis repeated declarations that Iran’s program has been “obliterated” are less triumph than warning: don’t ask for more -- a signal that he’s done enough and won’t be drawn further in, says Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute think-tank in Washington.\n\nFor all their rhetoric, Netanyahu and his hawkish allies offer no viable blueprint or roadmap for regime change, says Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat and Farsi-speaking expert on Iran. Unlike Iraq, there are no boots on the ground and no credible opposition that could topple the ruling elite, guarded by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe U.S. may support Israel’s military actions, even supplying advanced weaponry, but it is betting mainly on economic pressure and diplomatic leverage to force Tehran’s hand. The result is a fragile standoff, with no clear endgame, the diplomats said.\n\nNetanyahu sees a fleeting strategic opportunity, one that demands acceleration, not hesitation, the source close to him said. In his calculus, the time to strike harder is now, before Iran regains its footing, the source said.\n\nIran's air defences are battered, its nuclear infrastructure weakened, its proxies decapitated and its deterrence shaken. But Tehran’s window to regroup and rebuild will grow with time, says the person familiar with Netanyahu's thinking.\n\nSo for Netanyahu, this is unfinished business -- strategic, existential, and far from over, the diplomats and the two Middle East officials said.\n\n(Writing by Samia Nakhoul; Editing by David Gauthier-Villars and William Maclean)",

Piskarev is one of the law’s authors.\n\n\"This will increase the effectiveness of investigations into criminal cases of this category and guarantee the protection of suspected spies and terrorists from unauthorised communication with suspects in other types of crimes,\" he said.\n\nAccording to him, the adoption of such a law is \"an appropriate response by the state\" to existing security threats amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, following which \"the activities of foreign special services have intensified significantly\".\n\nThe law will come into force on 1 January 2026.\n\nAnna Karetnikova, a former analyst with the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, told Vazhnye Istorii that the adoption of this law marks a return to practices characteristic of the KGB (Committee for State Security of the USSR), which Russia abandoned after the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s and 2000s as part of its commitments undertaken when it joined the Council of Europe in 1996.\n\n\"Detention and investigation cannot be concentrated in the same hands,\" she said. \"If this is done, it will legalise the arbitrariness that exists now, whereby confessions will be extracted from detainees by creating unbearable conditions of detention.\"\n\nKaretnikova also notes that it will become even more challenging to obtain information about cases against political prisoners, even though many cases are already classified, such as those involving treason.\n\n\"We will not find out anything about these cases, what is happening to these people, whether they are being tortured or not, whether they are being fed or not,\" she stressed. \"I think that their external relations with the world will be limited, as will correspondence with political prisoners, around which civil society is now largely consolidating.\"\n\nThe FSB was allowed to operate its own detention centres until 2006. After that, they came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation and became part of the Federal Penitentiary Service. The only exception is the Lefortovo detention centre in Moscow, which has informally remained under FSB jurisdiction. Although officially subordinate to the Federal Penitentiary Service, the detention centre building is physically connected to the FSB’s investigative department.\n\nThere are seven detention centres in Russia under the central authority of the Federal Penitentiary Service, including the Kremlin Central Detention Centre, located inside Moscow's Matrosskaya Tishina Detention Centre No. 1.\n\nSupport Ukrainska Pravda onPatreon!",

    "News_title":"Trump’s sudden shift on weapons for Ukraine takes the war back to square one",
    "News_text":"For a fleeting moment,Ukraine’s conflictmay have come full circle.\n\nIn the past 48 hours, US President Donald Trump has perhaps said his mostforcefully direct wordsyet on arming Ukraine. And in the same period, the Kremlin have given their blankest indication to this White House that they are not interested in a realistic, negotiated settlement to the war.\n\nLet us start with Trump’s comments on arming Ukraine, a reversion to a basic bedrock of US foreign policy for decades – opposing Russian aggression. “We’re going to send some more weapons,” the president said Monday of Ukraine. “We have to – they have to be able to defend themselves. They’re getting hit very hard.”\n\nBehind him, his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth nodded, despite this contradiction of the administration’s announcement days earlier of military shipments being stopped. What did Trump actually mean? He was short on detail.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman later said that “at President Trump’s direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.”\n\nThe about-face came days after Volodymyr Zelensky’s call with Trump on Friday, in which the Ukrainian leader said the two men spoke of joint weapons production, and air defense.\n\nZelensky urgently needs more Patriot interceptor missiles, which are the only way of taking down Russian ballistic missiles, and which only the US can authorize trade in. Trump spoke a day earlier with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has offered to buy Patriots from the US to supply to Ukraine. Enough is afoot to have led Zelensky to declare on Saturday his Trump call was “the best conversation we have had during this whole time, the most productive.”\n\nTrump’s failure to provide details may be strategic, or a by-product of his occasional disdain for them. But while he may sound briefly a little more like his predecessor, Joe Biden, in terms of arming Ukraine, herein lies one stark difference. Biden publicly announced in agonizing detail every capability he gave Kyiv, perhaps hoping the transparency would avoid a sudden unexpected escalation with Moscow.\n\nInstead, Biden ended up with an excruciating public debate with Kyiv about every new system, and arms shipment, during which every seemingly impossible demand – from HIMARS rockets, to tanks, to F-16 fighter jets, to strikes inside Russia by ATACMs – was eventually acceded to. The plain, open ladder of American escalation was laid bare to the Kremlin. Trump perhaps seeks to avoid that by saying less.\n\nBut after barely six months in office, Trump finds himself back where Biden always was, after trying almost everything else – cosying up to then criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin,falling outandmaking upwith Zelensky, and spurning before eventually backing Europe. But the timing of his latest conversion, however enduring, reveals the desperation of this moment in the conflict.\n\nThe most recent,record Russian use of dronesto attack Kyiv exposed possibly critical shortcomings in the capital’s air defenses. They would only have worsened without being resupplied, at a time when Ukraine has reported 160,000 Russian troops are massing to the north and east of the frontlines. The months ahead will be unpredictable and critical for Kyiv, even with renewed US military support.\n\nTrump’s reversal may have stopped panic edging towards the risk of collapse. Why the shift?\n\nTrump has always tried playing nice with Putin. Patient diplomacy, gentle words, and even last week’s brief pause in military aid – a Kremlin demand for a deal – still did nothing to change Putin’s position. The Kremlin does not want peace. And so Trump has learned slowly, rejecting the travails of recent history, that Russia is an opponent.\n\nThe end of the US’ longest war in Afghanistan, in which Bidenwithdrew fastin the wake of a hasty deal signed by Trump with the Taliban, led to scenes that haunted Trump’s predecessor and remain a potent stick with which Republicans beat Democrats. The repetition of a similar rout of American allies in Ukraine, or Eastern Europe, would be an indelible stain on the Republican or MAGA record. That is not imminent, or even that likely for now. But the seeds of it lie perhaps in any success for Putin’s planned aggression in the coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, after six months of toying with the ideas of diplomacy, the Kremlin is back where it started too: willing to accept a peace only if it is surrender by another name. Its recent goal has been achieved: it has flattered the White House’s belief that it could talk out an end to the war, and taken enough time in talks that Russia’s summer offensive is now adequately manned, and the ground below these troops hard.\n\nAs recently as Monday, Putin’s top diplomat was repeating Russia’s most maximalist set of demands. Sergey Lavrov told a Hungarian newspaper that the “underlying causes” of the war must be eliminated, and gave a long, expansive list of impossibles, including the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, lifting sanctions on Russia, rescinding all lawsuits against Russia, and returning the illegally seized Western-based assets.”\n\nHe added to that a requirement that Ukraine pledge to never join NATO, and also that occupied Ukrainian territory be recognized as Russian, including parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson that Moscow hasn’t even seized yet. It was a dizzying echo of Russia’s demands when it engaged in diplomacy for the first time in Istanbul, in the opening weeks of the war, as itssoldiers shot civilians deadin the suburbs of Kyiv.\n\nPutin’s rationale for rejecting real diplomacy is simple. He has sold this war (falsely) as an existential clash between Russia and its traditional values, and a liberal, expansionist and aggressive NATO. It is a binary moment in Russian history, his narrative insists. To entertain a short, albeit deceptive ceasefire on American terms would contradict the urgency of that false story, and risk undermining the skimpy morale of his troops, whose lives his commanders often fritter away in brutal, frontal assaults.\n\nPutin can mollify Trump with talk of his desire for peace. But he cannot let slip the façade of the motherland being under assault. His retreat back to type has been shorter and easier than Trump’s. But still the Kremlin sees the enemy where it always has been, and where it always needs to be, for its war of choice to continue ending the lives of so many Russian men early.\n\nAnd so, for a brief moment, Putin and Trump find themselves back where Russia and the US were in 2022. Moscow has tens of thousands more troops reportedly amassed to invade Ukraine yet again. Diplomacy seems pointless. Washington needs to help defend Ukraine or risk global embarrassment – the demise of its military hegemony. And Ukraine is still there, in the middle, watching both powers on either side vacillate and spin, yet holding on.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Southeast Asia Reels as Trump’s Tariffs Escalate Tensions",
    "News_text":"Southeast Asian governments have been jolted into crisis mode once again.\n\nAs U.S. President Donald Trump sent out a fresh round of tariff letters on Monday, trade anxieties have been reignited across the region. Political leaders and economists have responded with a mix of shock and determination—shock at how high the proposed tariffs remain, and determination to use the few weeks left before Trump’s new deadline of Aug. 1 to secure better terms.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n\nThailand-Cambodia Border Closures Snarl Regional Trade, Apparel Manufacturing\n\nPresident Xi Aims to Cement 'Iron Clad Friendships' in Asia Amid US Tariff Drama\n\nSoutheast Asian Countries See Markets Tumble; Move From Shock to Action\n\nThe July 2 agreement with Vietnam had injected cautious optimism into the region. That deal lowered tariffs on Vietnamese exports to 20 percent—down from a previously announced 46 percent—while setting a 40 percent tariff on transshipped goods. In exchange, the U.S. will gainzero-tariff accessto Vietnamese markets.\n\nVietnam remains the region’s largest apparel exporter to the U.S., sending roughly $18.6 billion worth of goods in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Cambodia follows with $7.8 billion, then Indonesia at $6.4 billion, Thailand at $2.7 billion, and Malaysia at $1.6 billion.\n\nAt a press conference in Phnom Penh on Tuesday, Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol acknowledged that negotiations with the U.S. would continue. He highlighted one silver lining: the tariff had dropped from the 49 percent announced in April to 36 percent in Trump’s latest letter. However, he pointed out that in some cases, such as Malaysia, tariffs had actually increased—from 24 percent to 25 percent.\n\nThe local business community in Phnom Penh responded with growing unease.\n\n“Disappointed,”  Ken Loo, Secretary General of the Textile, Apparel, Footwear and Travel Goods Association of Cambodia (TAFTAC), told Sourcing Journal  summing up his reaction to the 36 percent tariff.\n\nBut he quickly added, “There are still three weeks. The government will continue to negotiate with the U.S. and try to strike a deal.”\n\nPresident Trump’s letters emphasized the need for reciprocal trade, echoing themes from his earlier administration. “Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from reciprocal,” Trump wrote in his letter to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet dated July 7. “Starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Cambodia a tariff of only 36% on any and all Cambodian products sent into the United States, separate from all sectoral tariffs. Goods transshipped to evade a higher tariff will be subject to the higher tariff.”\n\nTrump further stated that if Cambodia or its companies chose to build or manufacture products within the U.S., they would face no tariff at all. “We will do everything possible to get approvals quickly, professionally, and routinely—in other words, in a matter of weeks.”\n\nHe also warned that if Cambodia increased its own tariffs on U.S. goods, the U.S. would respond by adding an equal percentage to the existing 36 percent. “These tariffs are necessary to correct the many years of Cambodia’s tariff and non-tariff policies and trade barriers,” he wrote, calling the trade deficit with Cambodia a threat to U.S. national security.\n\nThe letter concluded: “You will never be disappointed with the United States of America.”\n\nCambodia, where the U.S. accounts for 39 percent of garment, footwear, and travel goods exports, is heavily reliant on preferential market access from both the U.S. and the European Union. A withdrawal of those benefits, analysts warn, could shake the very foundation of its export-driven economy.\n\nTrade expert Massimiliano Tropeano pointed out that Cambodia’s exclusion from any mention of transshipment provisions—as Vietnam was—is both confusing and potentially concerning. “Although it is not yet clear what will be considered ‘transshipping’ and what will not, Cambodia strangely enough did not have a similar clause,” he said. “The 36 percent is quite high—almost at the same level as Vietnam’s transshipment duty of 40 percent.”\n\nHe added that it remains uncertain whether garments made with Chinese raw materials would be classified as transshipments. “Vietnamese factories will now have to demonstrate a ‘substantial transformation.’ This could increase orders to local mills using locally sourced fabrics, and perhaps a shift toward dyeing and finishing facilities in Cambodia too.”\n\nThe past two months of tariff confusion have already battered Cambodia’s garment sector. In 2024, Cambodia’s garment industry posted $13.6 billion in exports, supporting approximately 918,000 formal jobs.\n\nManufacturers told Sourcing Journal that the uncertainty has disrupted planning, added costs, and forced brands to reconsider sourcing strategies—including possibly redirecting orders to competing countries.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Better Factories Cambodia (BFC), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) underscored these anxieties. Nearly half of Cambodia’s garment, footwear, and travel goods factories reported that they were uncertain they could maintain operations beyond the next three months due to tariff uncertainty and declining buyer confidence.\n\nMore than a quarter of factories said buyers were pushing for price reductions; 15 percent reported having few or no orders on hand.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted across 756 registered factories, revealed:\n\n44 percent of factories could operate at current capacity for three more months at most\n\n27 percent said buyers had requested lower prices for 2025 orders\n\n15 percent reported minimal or no orders\n\n65 percent still expressed cautious optimism\n\nFactories exporting to the U.S. made up the bulk of respondents. Of those, 51 perent of their output was U.S.-bound. Factories exporting to the EU accounted for 31 percent of production. Other major markets included Japan, Canada, China, Australia, and the UK.\n\nHow long can factories sustain their business? Forty percent  said they could sustain operations for one to three months; 8 percent said less than one month. With the sector already characterized by rapid turnaround times and flexible production schedules, even a slight decline in orders could trigger widespread layoffs and suspensions—reminiscent of the COVID-19 trade collapse, the survey found.\n\nThe survey also noted other issues, including labor shortages, which were compounding the problem, with rising competition from new provincial factories and worker relocation issues that have contributed to a high attrition rate and diminished efficiency.\n\nOther countries in the region have been reacting with a similar sense of shock.\n\nJapan and South Korea face blanket 25 percent duties, while Myanmar and Laos were hit with 40 percent, and Indonesia with 32 percent.\n\nIndonesia’s government has moved quickly. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto is set to resume negotiations with U.S. trade envoys to reduce the 32 percent tariff. “There is a narrow window for diplomacy, and everyone is recalculating their leverage,” said one Jakarta-based trade official.\n\nMeanwhile, the tariff blow hit Thailand hard. The 36 percent figure was unchanged from April levels—despite Thailand submitting a new proposal to Washington on Sunday, pledging to cut its $46 billion trade surplus by 70 percent within five years. Commerce Minister Jatuporn Buruspat said that an additional review and other countermeasures would be considered, while preparing for renewed talks with the U.S.\n\nThe situation in Thailand has been complicated further by a changing political landscape: Prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended by court order over alleged ethical misconduct related to a border dispute with Cambodia.\n\nMalaysia’s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI) said Tuesday it remained committed to ongoing engagement with the U.S. toward a “balanced, mutually beneficial, and comprehensive” trade agreement. Malaysia saw its proposed tariff increase slightly—from 24 to 25 percent.\n\nAnalysts say this is a make-or-break moment for Southeast Asian trade diplomacy. Each country must now perform a delicate balancing act: securing national interests without undermining regional solidarity or provoking harsher terms.\n\nAs each nation scrambles to adjust their numbers—and perhaps offer concessions or deeper market access—the urgency is palpable.",

    "News_title":"What Textile-to-Textile Recyclers Want From EU Legislation",
    "News_text":"As far as theT2T Alliance—T2T being short for textile-to-textile, as in recycling—is concerned, the European Union’s ecodesign for sustainable products regulation has one massive flaw: it doesn’t provide sufficient latitude for different kinds of textile waste.\n\nIt’s the legislation’s exclusion of post-industrial waste from recycled content targets that served as a “huge, huge, huge” reason for the industry association’s formation, said Dolly Vellanki-Seijger, sourcing and public affairs manager at Circ, a Virginia-based firm that aligned itself with the likes of Circulose, Syre, Samsara Eco and Sanko’s Re&Up Recycling Technologies after realizing they were dealing with the same issue. As the “defining textile policy of 2025,” the ESPR is poised to introduce market-entry ecodesign requirements that mandate a marked boost in recycled textile fibers by 2028. This cannot happen by artificially restricting waste to the post-consumer kind, she added.\n\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n\nReintroduced Bill Would Shift CBP's Operational Costs Away from Ports\n\nDefense Spending Bill Boosts US Producers of Military Shoes and Gear\n\nTrump Announces 30% Duties on EU, Mexico\n\n“Whether you’re a policymaker or a brand or a recycler, we all want tosee textile-to-textile recycling scale,” Vellanki-Seijger said. “Post-industrial waste isn’t a low-hanging fruit or just a fallback; it’s a viable starting point for us to start building these circular textile-to-textile recycling supply chains. It’ll be really difficult to scale if we narrow ourselves down to only one type of waste stream and if that waste stream is post-consumer.”\n\nThat’s because sourcing exclusively from post-consumer textiles waste as of 2028 is simply not feasible, the T2T Alliance wrote in its inaugural position paper on the forthcoming ESPR delegated act on textiles, meant to amend or supplement non-essential elements of the legislation. And with revisions of the waste framework directive continuing to be subject to delays, pushing back extended producer responsibility schemes to 2028 at the earliest, there won’t be enough time to cue up the necessary collection, sorting and processing for recycling capacity, it said.\n\nOther experts agree. Europe’s sorting infrastructure is currently primed for reuse, with limited capacity or skill to sort for recycling. There’s also the fact that the continent’s used textile value chain is itselfagainst the ropesbecause of the deluge of low-quality, low-value “fast” fashion amid increasing operational costs. This has left the sector, in the words of organizations like RREUSE and Zero Waste Europe, “on the brink of financial collapse.”\n\n“Including post-industrial waste in recycled content definitions makes sense given current infrastructure realities,” said Priyanka Khanna, scaling director at Fashion for Good, a sustainable innovation platform headquartered in Amsterdam. “While post-consumer recycling systems are still developing globally, post-industrial waste provides an immediate source of materials for textile recycling technologies.”\n\nRecyclers prefer post-industrial—or pre-consumer—feedstock because it’s easier to obtain large quantities of uniform material with predetermined fiber compositions. Post-consumer waste, with itsmore dubious provenance, on the other hand, is an iffier proposition, particularly since castoffs collected curbside can havehigher levels of contaminationfrom liquids or food waste that can render them unsuitable for recycling.\n\nCritics of allowing the inclusion of post-industrial waste argue that it could incentivize overproduction, drive market distortions or make conditions worse for European collectors and sorters, especially if it’s shipped from the global South, where garment manufacturing is in greater abundance. With separate collection systems for used textiles having gone into effect in the EU only in January, however, Vellanki-Seijger said that it will take time not only to socialize the concept but also to gain critical mass in terms of volumes that can be relied upon with some kind of predictable cadence. It’s important, she said, to allow things to scale so that “they can be ready for us when we are open to welcome and accept these types of feedstock.”\n\n“Regardless of how many changes you make in the design practices in optimizing your efficiency, you will always have post-industrial waste,” she added. “A lot of that post-industrial waste that is sitting in manufacturing regions has historically been directed towards mechanical recycling or downcycling. So what we’re offering is a solution for turning that into higher-value recycling so that it can go back into textiles.”\n\nClara von Luckner, director and fashion lead at advisory and investment company Systemiq, which recentlypublished a reportabout enabling a textile-to-textile recycling breakthrough in Europe, said that one way of managing the short-term supply gap would be to allow a portion of recycled content to come from post-industrial and pre-consumer waste while “phasing in a mandatory post-consumer share over time.” Without appropriate guardrails, she said, allowing post-industrial waste as a feedstock source could undercut the core policy objective: bringing Europe’s growing volumes of post-consumer textile waste into circular material loops, rather than exporting or incinerating it, often in geographies lacking adequate waste management systems.\n\n“This is especially pressing given the social and environmental consequences visible in places like Ghana and the Atacama desert,” von Luckner said.\n\nAnother area of concern would be where the feedstock comes from, something that the position paper doesn’t address and is a “live policy debate ”in other sectors such as packaging and automotive manufacturing. It’s a quandary von Luckner expects to come to the fore as policy proposals mature: Should recycled content be sourced from within Europe to support local circularity and investment, and if so, how could this be achieved in practice?\n\nThere are other questions, too, such as how much recycled content—no matter where from—is enough? Overall, the T2T Alliance wants to see “ambitious but realistic” and gradually increasing performance requirements for recycled content at the product level. The organization is suggesting 10 percent by 2028, 15 percent by 2030 and 30 percent by 2035. Right now, Vellanki-Seijger said, there isn’t a clear benchmark that it can “advocate for or go against.”\n\nPhased targets for recycled content can also create the definitive market signals required to drive investment in textile-to-textile recycling innovations, Khanna said. Her experience working with technology companies shows that “gradual, realistic requirements help brands plan their sourcing strategies while encouraging the investment needed to scale breakthrough recycling technologies.”\n\nKhanna also echoed the T2T Alliance’s call for chain-of-custody verification that can “ensure transparency and build industry trust” with robust tracking systems. A stronger mass balance approach is also needed, perhaps with the aid of emerging digital technologies, she said. While detractors of the practice say it allows companies to make recycled content claims without guaranteeing that the product contains actual recycled materials, proponents say it’s necessary to scale sustainable practices.\n\n“We know that in other industries, mass balance has been receiving a little bit of controversial opinion, especially in terms of the information that is given to the consumers,” Vellanki-Seijger said. “But I think with the other delegated acts—with thedigital product passport—we can provide more information to the consumers than what is simply on the label.”\n\nThat’s where the information requirements that the T2T Alliance is urging come in, as well. Without “clear, traceable” data on the recycled content within products, validating claims and verifying compliance becomes tricky, paving the way forpotential greenwashing, whether inadvertent or not. Vellanki-Seijger, returning to the organization’s prime reason for existing, wants to see the opposite by ensuring that the origin of where recycling takes place is without doubt.\n\n“We want to be able to point out if the material is coming from post-industrial or post-consumer sources,” she said. “And we also want to make sure that what percentage of recycled material is actually in a product is also clear. But this needs to go hand in hand with the performance requirement first.”\n\nAs Circ’s sourcing czar, Vellanki-Seijger has a personal stake in all this. The company will throw open the doors of itsfirst commercial-scale plantin Saint Avold, France, in 2028. Its expected capacity? 70,000 metric tons of polycotton textiles—a small fraction of the overall market, to be sure, but a sizable amount for a somewhat nascent technology.\n\n“So I’ll need to source quite a big volume to be able to feed that facility,” she said. “And if I only rely on post-consumer, I’m not going to meet the feedstock requirements that I have. So we also need to spread our risk and diversify in terms of where we’re sourcing from. And at the end of the day, all waste streams need a solution, not just post-consumer.”",

    "News_title":"Pentagon policy chief’s rogue decisions have irked US allies and the Trump administration",
    "News_text":"Elbridge Colby spent the last several years in Washington making a name for himself as an experienced, restraint-minded foreign policy leader eager to focus the U.S. military away from Europe and toward the Indo-Pacific.\n\nBut since joining the second Trump administration as the Pentagon's top policy chief, Colby has made a series of rapid-fire moves that have blindsided parts of the White House and frustrated several of America’s foreign allies, according to seven people familiar with the situation. All were granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump administration dynamics.\n\nFlanked by a team of handpicked policy experts and staff from Capitol Hill, Colby has gotten out ahead of the administration on several major foreign policy decisions.\n\nHe prompted last week’s decision,first reported by POLITICO, to halt shipments of some air defense missiles to Ukraine,which caught many Trump allies and lawmakers off guard. This week, President Donald Trump said he would reverse the decision to pause the weaponsbut claimed he did not know who had approved it.\n\nColby also surprised top officialsat the State Department and the National Security Council in June when he decided to review America’s submarine pact with Australia and the U.K.\n\n“He is pissing off just about everyone I know inside the administration,” said one person familiar with the situation. “They all view him as the guy who’s going to make the U.S. do less in the world in general.”\n\nAnd in conversations with defense counterparts from Britain and Japan in recent months, Colby’s hard-charging style has caused serious dustups.\n\n“He has basically decided that he's going to be the intellectual driving force behind a kind of neo-isolationism that believes that the United States should act more alone, that allies and friends are kind of encumbering,” said a person familiar with the Trump administration dynamics.\n\nColby did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWilliam Martin, communications director to Vice President JD Vance, called Colby \"a consummate professional, an experienced national security official and a reliable team player\" who is \"wholly committed to President Trump's America First foreign policy agenda.\"\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said Colby is doing exactly what would be expected of his job. “The entire purpose of Undersecretary Colby's job is to provide policy recommendations to Secretary Hegseth, and his advice has proved to be invaluable,” he wrote in an email.\n\nParnell added there is “zero daylight” between Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Colby.\n\nWhen the British defense team came to the Pentagon in June and spoke about the U.K.’s decision tosend an aircraft carrier to Asiaon a routine deployment, Colby interjected with a brusque comment.\n\n“He basically asked them, ‘Is it too late to call it back?’” said the person familiar with Trump administration dynamics. “Because we don't want you there.” A second person familiar with the meeting confirmed this account.\n\nThe British team on the other side of the table “were just shocked,” the first person added. “He was basically saying, ‘You have no business being in the Indo-Pacific.’”\n\nColby has also irked allies by pushing them too hard to boost defense spending — or telling them to simply get out of America’s way. “DOD has been telling a European partner that we don’t need the Europeans to be doing anything [in the Indo-Pacific],” said one U.S. official familiar with the conversations.\n\nIn the spring, Japanese officials believed the Trump administration might push them for a modest increase in defense spending. Initially, Colby publicly called on Japan to spend “at least 3 percent of GDPon defense as soon as possible,” which angered Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. But that number soon increased to amuch steeper target of 5 percent, which reportedly contributed tothe collapse of plansfor a high-level meeting between Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their Japanese counterparts.\n\n“The Japanese were very frustrated,” said a person familiar with the talks. “They thought that they were agreeing to at least negotiate on the basis of 3 or 3.5 percent. Then Colby, all of a sudden, got DOD to say 5, and the Japanese got angry, because that's not what they just agreed to.”\n\nThe incident caused heartburn within Japan’s ruling party, with officials worried about triggering a domestic political backlash ahead of a sensitive election, the person added.\n\nThe hawkish wing of the Republican Party has expressed concerns that Colby’s “shoot first and ask questions later” approach is sapping Trump’s foreign policy of its strength at a key moment.\n\n“The president’s leadership at NATO and his decision to strike Iran gave Russia and China good reason to fear America’s resolve,” said a senior GOP aide. “But Colby has just undercut the president and squandered his boss’ leverage.”\n\nThe AUKUS review surprised some State Department officials who dealt directly with the pact. The department’s immediate guidance on how to respond to media questions about the topic appeared to underscore the lack of coordination, a State Department official said. The instructions told diplomats to say to reporters: “We are not aware of a review of the AUKUS agreement. The secretary of Defense has not requested a review of the agreement from the secretary of State.”\n\n“The way that one person from State put it to me is: ‘Who is this fucking guy?’” said a former U.S. official familiar with the policy discussions.\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce praised Colby’s leadership. “The world is changing rapidly and Elbridge understands the moment. His innovative leadership is critical to addressing the challenges head-on and helping to deliver on President Trump’s America First agenda.”\n\nTrump’sannouncement Mondaythat he would resume weapons shipments to Ukraine, just days after the Pentagon paused them, left the impression on some lawmakers that restraint-minded officials at the Pentagon were out of step with the president.\n\n“I'm deeply worried that [Colby] buys into the authoritarian worldview that you know, Putin's a dictator, and Xi is a dictator, and Trump aspires to be a dictator, so let's just let all the dictators get together and divide up the world,” said House Armed Services ranking member Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.). “That is horrific policy for the world and for the United States.”\n\nColby, the grandson of a former CIA director, has allies throughout the Pentagon, including Alex Velez-Green and Austin Dahmer, former staffers for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.); and Katherine Thompson, who holds the Pentagon’s top job for Europe, Africa and NATO. All of them have embraced his approach. Others, including Alexander Gray, who served in the first Trump administration as chief of staff on the National Security Council, defended Colby as someone committed to the president and Hegseth’s agenda.\n\n“The things that are publicly known that he's pushing for are all things that are consistent with the president and the secretary's stated positions and guidance,” Gray said. “The guy's a skilled bureaucratic tactician, and he's good at implementing what the people above him want, and people who don't win in those battles go and complain about it.”",

    "News_text":"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea sent six North Koreans back across the rivals' sea border on Wednesday morning, months after they drifted south in wooden boats in March and May.\n\nIt came after months of failed efforts to contact North Korea to coordinate the repatriation of the six individuals, who officials say consistently expressed a desire to go back.\n\nDespite the lack of communication, a North Korean patrol boat appeared at the handover point as the six individuals headed back aboard a repaired wooden boat, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry.\n\nWhat would have been a routine event in years past was complicated by the North’s decision to cut off communications with the South in recent years.\n\nNorth Koreans have occasionally drifted south in wooden boats before, sometimes accidentally and sometimes with the intention of defecting. In most previous cases, the two Koreas coordinated to send those who wished to turn back across the land border.\n\nSouth Korea twice informed the North of its intention to repatriate the North Koreans on Wednesday through the U.S.-led United Nations Command, but received no response, the ministry said.\n\nSouth Korean authorities are also investigating aNorth Korean man who crossed the heavily fortified land borderbetween the Koreas on Friday and was taken into custody by South Korean troops. South Korean officials have not disclosed whether the man expressed a desire to settle in the South.\n\nNorth Korea has effectively suspended almost all diplomacy and direct communication with South Korea following the collapse of its nuclear negotiations with Washington in 2019.\n\nRelations between the Koreas have worsened since 2022 as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate his nuclear weapons and missile programs, while also sending troops and military equipment to support Russia’s war effort.\n\nSouth Korea’s previous conservative government responded to the growing North Korean threat by expanding combined military exercises with the United States and Japan, which the North condemned as invasion rehearsals.\n\nBorder tensions have flared in recent months as the two Koreas traded Cold War-style psychological warfare, with North Korea sending thousands of trash-filled balloons toward the South and South Korea blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda through loudspeakers.\n\nSince taking office last month, South Korea’s new liberal PresidentLee Jae Myunghas madeefforts to rebuild trust with North Korea, halting the frontline loudspeaker broadcasts and moving to ban activists from flying balloons carrying propaganda leaflets across the border.",

    "News_title":"Iran pushes tens of thousands of Afghans back into hands of Taliban in ‘security’ crackdown",
    "News_text":"Iran is rounding uphundreds of thousands of Afghan immigrantsand pushing them over the border into the hands of the Taliban.\n\nThe victims, who include thousands of women and girls, are being left to fend for themselves at a dusty and inhospitable border crossing where temperatures regularly reach 45 degrees and there is little in the way of food or water.\n\nIran is using espionage allegations as a pretext for the mass arrests and deportations following the recent conflict with Israel.Nearly 450,000 refugees, many of whom arrived in Iran since the Taliban swept back to power in 2021, have been kicked out since the beginning of June and numbers have soared sincethe war with Israel, UN agencies have said.These deportations have affected more than 114,000 people in just a few days, including the separation of 5,000 children from their parents.Those targeted by the regime also reported suffering widespread abuses including beatings, arbitrary detention.The Telegraph spoke to Afghans in Iran, at the border, and in Afghanistan who said the regime in Tehran is targeting them to divert public attention from its “humiliation” by Israel in last month’s 12-day war.Mahmoud*, an Afghan refugee working as a labourer in Tehran, said he was detained at a bakery, and when he asked why, the officers began beating him – slapping his face and kicking him in the stomach to force him to reveal his address.”They kept hitting me all the way to my house, calling me a nasty Jew and Israeli,” he said.\n\nHe said the violence continued once they entered the home. His sons were beaten, and the family was given just 20 minutes to pack.“They treated us like criminals, you wouldn’t even treat an animal like that,” he said. “They handcuffed everyone, loaded us into a van, and even during the ride, they hurled sexual insults at us. We had documents there and had done nothing wrong.”He then found himself with a group of Afghans in a detention centre in the Iranian capital, where he was beaten again.“Four of them would come and start beating us with pipes and cables, and four would be waiting, then the other four would come and beat us,” Mahmoud recalled.He added: “Women and children were screaming, the children were thirsty. They left us under the sun for three days before sending us to the border.Even then the ordeal was far from over.“Along the way, they took our phones, money, and even women’s jewellery,” he said. “They wanted to torture us to make sure we never return.”\n\nMany of those arriving in Islam Qala have never set foot in Afghanistan before, having been born and raised in Iran.But the Islamic Republic insists they should call the war-torn country home and they are now struggling to survive in a border town that even locals describe as “hell”.The border crossing is lined with makeshift shelters and belongings – torn bags, children’s shoes, and photos carried by the wind litter the ground.It is regularly battered by dust storms and heavy winds which push mountains of sand along the road to the nearest city, Herat.Mousa, a 32-year-old truck driver, said he was violently arrested, dragged into a van, and sent to the border without warning.“I was arrested inside a bank while trying to withdraw money,” he said. “I showed them my documents, but they didn’t care.“They took me to a camp and then straight to the border. I have nothing with me and no idea how things work here.”He was forced to leave everything behind – his family, his savings, and his car, which was still parked outside the bank.“They would have taken it all,” he said. “My children are too young, and my wife can’t manage alone. My plan is to get a passport and return – I can’t survive here.”Afghanistan – where 90 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line amid an economic collapse – cannot absorb the waves of people arriving, the Taliban government admits.A senior Taliban official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Telegraph that the Afghan government is facing its biggest challenge since capturing Kabul almost four years ago.“The regime in Tehran has never liked our people. Now they’re angry at the West, and Afghans have become their most convenient target,” the official said, adding that the government has been holding multiple cabinet meetings every week to discuss the crisis.“Each time, the conclusion is the same – we are overwhelmed. Our people are hungry, and they don’t even expect a good lifestyle or internet – they just want food. Our neighbours are not treating us well – we pray God will help our nation.”The people of Herat have mobilised in support of the large numbers of newcomers arriving in Islam Qala. Many have taken deportees into their own homes and cooked meals and taken food to the border.Locals are offering free transport from the border to the city, and grassroots groups are covering bus fares to help returnees reach their home towns and villages in Afghanistan. But they cannot help everyone.“A human catastrophe is unfolding in Islam Qala,” said one local taxi driver. “Girls as young as ten, beautiful but with faces faded like flowers left too long in the sun – or like fish gasping after being pulled from a river. I cried for them.”\n\nIn late May the Iranian authoritiesordered all undocumented Afghans to leave the country by July 6, a move potentially impacting four million people out of an estimated population of six million.\n\nWhile the millions of Afghans living in Iran had long been made economic scapegoats by the regime, the crackdown has evolved into something far more dangerous following the military confrontation with Israel.Daily deportations surged fifteen-fold during the 12-day war, from 2,000 to over 30,000 people per day, as the Iranian authorities channelled domestic rage toward a vulnerable minority.Raids on homes, workplaces, and construction sites have become common, as have beatings, while deportation is now effectively state policy.Many Afghans are now being arrested on charges of spying for Israel – an accusation many fear enough to flee Iran voluntarily – while xenophobia has soared.“The regime has turned the whole nation against us,” said Rulloah, an Afghan civil engineering graduate now working as a day labourer in Iran.“They’re taking revenge for their defeat,” he said. “People have been told not to sell us bread, give us work, or let us into parks and restaurants. Anyone who helps us can be fined or even charged.”He described how police arrested one of his relatives while he was digging a pit for £3 a day.Armed officers pulled him out of the hole, covered in dust, and began beating him.They then took a few small drones from their vehicle, photographed him with them, and took him away.“He can’t even read, but they insisted he was making drones,” said Rulloah. “An Iranian friend who saw him being arrested called me. Fearing they would come for his family too, I went to his house and took his wife and four children to a relative’s home.”In another case, a father of two, whose wife had died of cancer a few months earlier, left his 2-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter locked inside their home in an eastern Iranian city while he went to a nearby shop.He was arrested and taken away, and three days later, neighbours found the children dead, relatives of the man told The Telegraph, adding that they had no information about his current whereabouts or condition.\n\nThe crackdown has also created opportunities for exploitation of a vulnerable population.Some Iranian landlords have sought to take advantage of the situation by refusing to return rental deposits to Afghan families forced to leave, while many employers have reported their own Afghan workers to the police to get out of paying months of unpaid wages. Some Iranians who owe money to Afghans use the same tactic to escape repayment.Thousands have had their phone sim cards blocked, while goods are also being sold to Afghans at higher prices than to Iranians.In Afghanistan, a lack of resources means there is no end in sight to the crisis.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is seeking $2.42 billion in funding for its 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan for Afghanistan. But only 22.2 per cent has been secured to date.Because of the large numbers of people arriving, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN’s migration agency, has had to drastically reduce the cash assistance it offers to returnee families at the border from $2,000 per family to just $156, said Amy Pope, the IOM’s Director General.Critical funding gaps hinder the ability of IOM and partners to provide assistance, reaching only 10 per cent of those in need, she said.“Families are arriving with nothing but the clothes on their backs, exhausted and in urgent need of food, medical care and support.“The scale of returns is deeply alarming and demands a stronger and more immediate international response. Afghanistan cannot manage this alone.”\n\n* The Telegraph has changed the names of the Afghan refugees to protect them from possible reprisal\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more aboutGlobal Health Security\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Before its infamous collapse,American Apparelwas a cultural force of the mid-2000s. The clothes were colorful, the ads were provocative, and the brand marketed itself as progressive with its proud motto: “Ethically Made, Sweatshop Free.”\n\nBut behind the scenes, beneath the indie sleaze and moral posturing, the company was quietly imploding. Now, thanks toNetflix’snew documentary anthologyTrainwreck, people finally have an inside look at what brought this once billion-dollar corporation to its knees.\n\nHere are the most shocking revelations fromThe Cult of American Apparel:\n\nFounderDov Charneywasn’t just building a brand—he was creating a look.\n\nFormer employees say they were hired on the spot simply because of their appearance: “I’m tall and skinny,” said one. Another claimed their “hipster meets bike messenger” style got them hired. In some cases, people with no fashion background were placed in senior roles.\n\nYes, it’s true.\n\nNew hires reportedly received Hitachi wand vibrators as part of their employee welcome kits.\n\nA safe working environment? Not exactly American Apparel’s thing.\n\nCharney didn’t just have a proclivity for sexual perversion; He also loved verbally abusing his staff!\n\nEvery week, he would hold mandatory company wide calls, during which he nominated a “fool of the week”—an employee who he believed “screwed him over.”\n\nThe whole thing was basically an exercise in ritualistic shaming.\n\nFormer American Apparel employees claim that they worked insane hours.\n\n“On one two-week period, on top of the 80 hours that I worked, there was another 120-something hours of overtime I clocked,” Carson, one of the documentary’s subjects, said.\n\nCharney reportedly treated Robert Greene’sThe 48 Laws of Powerlike gospel.\n\nThe book outlines how to manipulate and dominate in business and life, which people claim heavily influenced Charney’s leadership style.\n\nWhen the company went public in 2007, he even appointed Greene to the board\n\nBy 2014,several womenhad accused Charney of sexual harassment. However, many employees were bound by contracts that funneled complaints into private arbitration, shielding the company from public lawsuits.\n\nThe Civil rights attorneyToni Jaramilla, who was featured in the documentary, explained: “It started with one woman, then another. In doing our due diligence, we found more who had experienced the same thing.”\n\nFollowing a formal investigation, Charney was ousted for sexual harassment, discrimination, and misuse of company funds.\n\nToday, American Apparel lives on in name only. It exists as a fully online store owned by Canadian manufacturer Gildan Activewear. But the brand’s cultural relevancy has long vanished, and along with it, so too has the “cult” that once surrounded it.",

    "News_title":"Templeton Feed & Grain fire, demolition closed part of downtown. What’s open?",
    "News_text":"After a fire gutted the historicTempleton Feed & Grain building, a portion of the town’s downtown was taped off, leaving some stores and restaurants around the scene unsure of what their operations will look like in the near future.\n\nSeveral of these businesses along South Main Street area have opened their doors to customers following the initial fire and demolition of the granary, while others remain closed.\n\nAfter the fire ignited late on July 4, some even stayed opened even as firefighters continued to extinguish hot spots on Saturday. Many have noticed changes in foot traffic as the days go on.\n\nHere’s who is open and who’s closed during the granary’s demolition.\n\nAlthough its front entrance was closed Monday,Hewitt Hardwareis open with an alternative entrance located at the back of the store along Fifth Street.\n\nElijah Hewitt, manager and son of the owner of Hewitt Hardware, said not many people know that they are open, and he believes business in the next couple weeks may be slow.\n\nHewitt’s main concern for his business is how soon the road closure will be lifted, which would help the flow of traffic and get his store running back to normal.\n\n“I know some of them aren’t even able to open at all, so it’s fortunate that at least we can have a little bit of income in the meantime and our employees can come to work,” Hewitt said.\n\nTempleton Market and Deli remained open throughout the last few days following the late-night fire. Although the market has been busy, co-owner Abby Allen said the foot traffic is not unusual for them.\n\nAllen said she had been there the night of the fire, looking after her store until around 3 a.m. the next morning to make sure it would not be damaged.\n\nThe market had played a pivotal role providing meals, drinks and snacks to the fire crew and first responders at the scene. Allen said they had even picked up the tab for a group of firefighers who were eating at In N Out in Atascadero one day.\n\nThe Pig Iron Bar and Grillreopened its doors on Sunday with a full patio of customers who had a front-row seat watching to see if the granary’s towers would collapse, which they did not that day.\n\nTaylor Odenwald, Pig Iron co-owner, said they are usually busy this time of the year, but the fire and demolition had altered many people’s schedules and attitude around the town and their business has been affected by it.\n\nOdenwald said they don’t have “money sitting in the bank” to remain slow these next few weeks.\n\n“All we can do is try to provide an opportunity for people to get together and mourn the loss (of the granary),” Odenwald said.\n\nJack’s Bar and Grill BBQreopened on Monday, though its parking remained closed due to the demolition going one at the granary, bartender Liz Alvarez told The Tribune.\n\nThe granary is the “charm of the restaurant,” Alvarez said. Most of the pictures and decoration in the restaurant are of the landmark building, she said.\n\nAlvarez said the restaurant is usually busy and lively around this time of year. However, since the granary fire, it is mostly quiet and empty in and around the restaurant.\n\n“We’re being impacted more on an emotional level,” Alvarez said.\n\nAlvarez said she has a feeling that the demolition at the granary is going to affect their business in the next couple weeks.\n\nMcPhee’s Grill, the popular, longtime restaurant right across from the granary, has not reopened since the fire, although it is typically closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.\n\nMax McPhee, son of owner Ian McPhee, said he wanted to reopen the restaurant as soon as Friday, but their insurance company advised them to wait till next Wednesday.\n\nHe hopes the restaurant’s insurance will help cover the costs for its inability to run at the moment, including compensation for employees who have not been able to work.",

    "News_title":"Jury trials scrapped for sex offenders to cut court backlogs",
    "News_text":"Suspected sex offenders and drug dealers are among thousands of defendants who could be stripped of the right to a jury trial under “radical” proposals to tacklechronic court backlogs.\n\nUnder plans for a “once in a generation” reform of the courts, a review led by Sir Brian Leveson, a former appeal court judge, has recommended that defendants accused of 220 offences will no longer have an automatic right to be tried by a jury of their peers.\n\nSir Brian said restricting the historical right to a jury trial – which has its origins in the 1215 Magna Carta – was necessary becausecriminal justice was “too broken”and a “radical and essential package of measures to prevent total collapse of the system” was required.\n\nHe said ditching juries would mean simpler, speedier and cheaper justice, saving the equivalent of 9,000 court sitting days a year. His report comes as the backlog of Crown Court cases has risen to a record 77,000, with trials delayed as far ahead as 2029.\n\nIn his 378-page report published on Wednesday, Sir Brian proposes changes at every stage of the judicial process. His recommendations also includegreater use of cautionsand unpaid work to divert thousands of thieves, violent criminals and drug addicts away from courts.\n\nHe said defendants should receive a 40 per cent discount on their sentence if they pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, up from 33 per cent. It could mean a criminal facing a nominal 10 years in jail would serve just two years in prison.\n\nHowever, his biggest and most controversial reform is to the jury system, where he proposes that anyone facing a charge carrying a maximum sentence of two years in jail would lose their right to opt for a jury trial.\n\nSuch offences include assault of a police officer or other emergency worker, stalking, possession of an indecent photograph of a child, and causing death by driving an uninsured vehicle.\n\nHe also proposes creating a new division of the Crown Court, where a judge and two magistrates would sit without a jury to rule on some 166 offences carrying a maximum sentence of up to three years.\n\nThese include sex assaults, dealing or importing drugs, child abduction, violent disorder, assault causing actual bodily harm, causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, sex with a child under 13, burglary, firearms and knife possession, and fraud.\n\nA judge would decide whether a defendant’s case would be sent to the new court, or to the Crown Court with a jury. Crown Courts with juries would continue to deal with the most serious offences, such as murder, rape and terrorism.\n\nHowever, any Crown Court defendant would have a right to ask for a judge-only trial, which Sir Brian suggested may be because they might have a technical defence better understood by a judge or because they had committed a high-profile offence which “may not be particularly attractive to members of the public”.\n\nComplex cases that may last a year or more such as fraud, insider trading, bribery and money laundering, would also be dealt with only by a judge.\n\nSir Brian said: “The backlog has now become utterly unmanageable, and risks jeopardising the entirety of our criminal justice system.\n\n“Because the further you push cases off into the future, the more disincentive there is for those who are guilty of crime to admit their crime, because they can put it off in the hope it will just go away, or that the witnesses will lose interest.\n\n“So that is not only disastrous for victims and witnesses, but also for the administration of an effective criminal justice system… Doing nothing will lead, in my view, to the collapse of the system.”\n\nHe denied that sparing people guilty of thefts, drug use or minor assaults a criminal record by using out of court resolutions such as cautions was “soft justice”. “The challenge at the moment is that shop theft isn’t being prosecuted at all,” he said.\n\n“They could be offered some meaningful activity, or maybe a penalty, or maybe in appropriate cases, some unpaid work or some rehabilitation, which keeps them out of the criminal justice system.”\n\nShabana Mahmood, the Justice Secretary, said ministers will now consider the recommendations and will respond before legislating changes in the autumn. “Swifter justice requires bold reform, and that is what I asked Sir Brian Leveson to propose,” she said.\n\nRobert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, said: “Taken together, the Leveson andDavid Gaukereviews will see criminals like burglars, and even some killers, serve just a fifth of their prison sentence. That makes a mockery of our justice system.\n\n“Before tearing up our constitutional settlement by scrapping jury trials, Labour should maximise court sitting days and bear down on rampant inefficiency. But they refuse, and as a result the court backlog is rising fast on their watch.”\n\nThe Bar Council welcomed the focus on diverting offenders away from the courts but warned against proposals to remove jury trials.\n\n“Changing the fundamental structure of delivering criminal justice is not a principled response to a crisis which was not caused by that structure in the first place,” said Barbara Mills, the council’s chair.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_text":"Troy McKinley, organizer of the Minnesota Prepper Expo, poses for a portrait with the cart he affixed with skeletons at the Minnesota Prepper Expo at the Morrison County Fairgrounds in Little Falls, Minnesota, on Saturday, June 21, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri\/Minnesota Reformer)\n\nAs if to prove the difficulty of preparing for the unforeseen, the organizer of a recent prepper convention wasn’t ready for a heat wave that socked his gathering.\n\nTroy McKinley, the organizer of the 3rd Annual Minnesota Prepper Expo, wore a t-shirt that read, “Noah was a conspiracy theorist … then it rained” — in reference to the famous boat builder.\n\nHe acknowledged the heat probably kept people away from the Morrison County Fairgrounds on a recent blistering 90 degree Saturday that had driven most Minnesotans indoors.\n\nMcKinley hoped for 1,000 attendees at the prepper fair, but there were less than 100 in attendance on the convention’s second day.\n\nStill, a handful had pitched tents for the three-day event, and all signs point to a continued robust obsession with preparing for the American end: People shell out money to share in stories about the apocalypse. The causes are as diverse as their creators: cordiceps (“The Last of Us”); artificial intelligence (“The Terminator”); nuclear holocaust; solar storms; or, a global pandemic.\n\nThe end’s hold on humanity — and, it seems, Americans in particular — comprises art and entertainment, as well as the theological and political, with some Christians reading events in modern Israel as precursors to the “rapture,” while others once strained to see the anti-Christ in Barack Obama.\n\nMcKinley might have given the impression of a religious man, but as the self-described agnostic reflected on his upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, he said, “I had questions that they couldn’t answer.”\n\nThese days, McKinley, who once watched panicked oil workers loot a grocery store during a North Dakota snowstorm, has found community among preppers — like-minded people who make preparations for disaster scenarios.\n\nPreppers, sometimes called “doomsday preppers,” tend to conjure images of underground bunkers and zombie apocalypses. The expo leaned into this idea, its logo featuring silhouettes of zombies and bullet holes.\n\nBut most people gathered at the event — many hesitant to label themselves as preppers — were most concerned with technological or electric grid interruption or collapse, civil unrest or another pandemic, with memories of COVID-19’s run on toilet paper and cleaning supplies.\n\nJake Sparrow, who was selling his up-cycled clothing at the event, said he loved “The Walking Dead” but didn’t find it realistic.\n\nSparrow said his primary concern is EMPs, or electromagnetic pulses, that can result from natural events like solar storms or manmade nuclear detonation. EMPs cause voltage surges that can damage electronic equipment. Though widespread technological collapse due to nuclear detonation isunlikely,solar storms, though rare, do pose a concern forcommunications infrastructure. It was a common subject of conversation at the convention, with frequent references to the so-called Carrington Event, when a solar storm in 1859 caused telegraph systems to go haywire.\n\nSparrow suspects the government might produce an EMP while blaming it on a solar flare.\n\nRather than stockpiling resources, Sparrow said his focus is on refining skills like gardening, carpentry and bushcraft. He almost never carries a cell phone but does have a collection of weapons.\n\n“I guess I’m not concerned, but I’m almost expecting it,” Sparrow said of an electric grid collapse.\n\nSparrow’s wife, Amanda joked, “When’s it gonna happen? Let’s just get on with this already.”\n\nMany of the people at the convention, however, were less concerned with the end than with their atrophied survival skills, seeking sustainability in an increasingly technology-dependent world. Most of the presentations given by speakers — ranging from seed-saving to preserving food with salt — would’ve been equally relevant to homesteaders as those preparing for a life-altering catastrophe.\n\nIn a seminar about child-rearing in the wilderness, Elli King-Gallager said that the way she is raising her children – in the wilderness, with very limited technology – feels radical at first. “But it’s not radical at all,” she said. “All we’re really doing is living the way people were living 200 years ago. It’s not that big of a deal. It’s not that amazing.”\n\nA dozen people sat in a semicircle of folded chairs to hear Mike Bollinger, the executive director of Seed Savers Exchange, speak about preserving seeds.\n\nBollinger leads the largest nongovernmental seed bank in the U.S. The federal government’s much larger equivalent, known as the National Plant Germplasm System, was in flux earlier this year when the Department of Government Efficiencyfiredsome of its employees (they were later reinstated).\n\nThough Bollinger was unfamiliar with the prepper oeuvre, he drove from Iowa to give a talk at the event after the expo reached out to him.\n\nDemand for seedswent up significantlyduring COVID-19, the world-rattling event that caused many to think perhapspreppers were rightto be concerned about the fragility of society’s systems.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of enthusiasm around gardening and food production, but there’s a huge gap, I think, when it comes to just functional seed-saving skill,” Bollinger said.\n\nPrepping isn’t a new phenomenon. The modern incarnationoriginated in the 1950s, in part due to Cold War-era anxieties over nuclear warfare. The early manifestation of preppers — known as “retreaters” — stressed individualism and fleeing off-grid for survival purposes.\n\nGlobal catastrophes like COVID-19 and climate change-related natural disasters are fueling a growing number of modern preppers, including left-leaning survivalists. “Bug out” bags — backpacks filled with emergency survival supplies — are sold by online survival retailersfor hundreds of dollars.\n\nBy some estimates,there are more than 20 million preppers in the U.S., defined as people who would be able to survive for at least 31 days at home without utilities or outside support. This is compared to a total of7 million in 2018.\n\nEstimating the number of preppers can be difficult, especially because there’s no universal definition of what it means to be a prepper. Not everyone who makes small-scale disaster preparations — like storing blankets in the car in case of a snowstorm — would consider themselves preppers.\n\nThe term tends to raise eyebrows.\n\nMargaret Engstrom, a first-time attendee of the convention, spoke about the stigma associated with the label. Engstrom said she had been interested in prepping for decades but wouldn’t describe herself as “hardcore.”\n\n“I don’t think of myself as a nut job. I think of myself as alternative and prepared,” Engstrom said.\n\nAs the number of preppers has grown, so has the survival tools market. A 2023 report from Zion Market Research projected that the industry wouldgrow to $2.46 billion by 2030. Prepper conventions and expos like McKinley’s have been popping up around the country. PrepperShowsUSA, a website dedicated to advertising these events,lists several events per monthacross the country.\n\nMcKinley is in the process of organizing his first prepper expo in Colorado, to take place in October.\n\nIn one of the fairground’s large, open air buildings, a colorful “Poultry and Rabbits” sign hung over the entrance. Vendors stood among tables lined with damascus steel knives, 3D printed gun holsters, apocalypse books and herbal remedies.\n\nFrancis Majeski sat making cordage, a string made of natural fibers as a large fan next to him hummed. On his table, with bone needles and lyre lucets used for braiding, was a copy of “Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West,” which is about the western explorer who was the first white man to cross the Sierra Nevada, and issaid to havedrawn the mapof the American West on a beaver skin.\n\nMajeski didn’t identify strongly with the term “prepper.”\n\n“[I’m] not so much a survivalist as I practice the second-greatest commandment, love your neighbor as yourself,” Majeski said.\n\nIn contrast to the typical image of the hyper-individualist, solitary prepper — consider the Nick Offerman character in “The Last of Us” — Majeski said community, not individualism, would be the ultimate key to survival in a disaster scenario. That’s why he makes an effort to reach out to others.\n\n“I get to know my neighbor across the street, even though his son ran their car into my garage,” Majeski joked.\n\nMajeski described himself as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump but disagrees with many of his policies. He also rejected some of the ideas that seem to permeate prepper culture.\n\nThough Majeski plans to be more independent should anything happen — he now makes his own boot laces — he said there are limits.\n\n“We like to, in our arrogance, believe that we are going to be ready for everything. You’re not,” Majeski said.\n\nStill, mainstream prepper culture often emphasizes rugged individualism, touting guns and masculine portrayals harkening back to the ideals of westward expansion. In her book “American Apocalyptic,” Georgia College & State University professor and “liberal prepper” Juli Gittinger writes about the role that the American frontier myth still plays among many preppers.\n\n“Echoes of the frontier motif have been used repeatedly throughout the American political landscape, from Kennedy’s ‘New Frontier’ to Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ — an imagined reality where rugged individualism and self-reliance can overcome any obstacle (notably, non-white people who interfere with the divine providence of American destiny)…The frontier myth cultivates a particular brand of masculinity that intersects with the discourse on firearm ownership, survivalist\/prepper cultures, ‘traditional’ (read: heteronormative) models of the family, and white superiority,” Gittinger writes in “American Apocalyptic.”\n\nWhile these sentiments were not entirely absent from those at the convention, they also weren’t dominating the conversation.\n\nMcKinley said that his goal with the expo is to foster community between preppers: “I hope that they’re connecting with each other, meeting other like-minded people, and learning to work together on things instead of going after each other,” he said.\n\nHe reached out to many of the speakers and vendors personally. Amanda and Jake Sparrow got an invite after running into McKinley at a farmers market in Little Falls.\n\nThe schedule of speakers included a note about inclusivity at the event: “Hate speech, bullying, or degrading comments referring to topics such as political affiliation, race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will NOT be tolerated.”\n\nMcKinley’s experience with disaster response is almost pedestrian: He was in North Dakota when high winds during a winter storm knocked down the power lines. The oil wildcatters who had recently moved to the area to open an oil field were not ready for it.\n\n“These young guys, they’ve never seen anything like that before, and they panicked. They broke the windows out of the two main grocery stores. They cleared the shelves off of bottled water and canned goods and stuff like that,” McKinley said.\n\nSince then, McKinley has been ensuring he has extra groceries and generators. His primary concerns when it comes to disasters are solar flares,electromagnetic eruptionsfrom the sun, and pole reversals, which is when Earth’s magnetic north and south polesflip, which happens an average of every 300,000 years.\n\nMcKinley was clear to say that he’s “not a gun collector,” though he does own guns.\n\n“My weapons all have a purpose, you know, and so I don’t have a lot of them,” McKinley said.\n\nPrepping caught national headlines at the end of June, when acourt filingdescribed suspected assassin Vance Boelter and his wife as preppers. Boelter is accused of killing Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.\n\nBoelter owned dozens of guns and had made a “bailout plan” for his family that included going to Jenny Boelter’s mother’s house in Wisconsin. The morning of the assassination, Boeltertexted his family, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.”\n\nThe affidavit didn’t include many details about Boelter’s prepping, and Boelter didn’t feature in conversations at the convention.\n\nBoelter’s roommate, David Carlson, told theStar Tribunethat the prepper label fit Boelter but he was uncertain how involved in prepping Boelter actually was.\n\n“He always thought there would be civil war or the government would fall,” Carlson said. “I knew he had some firearms or food, maybe. I only thought he had like five or 10 guns. I was shocked to find out he had so many.”\n\nAs the second day of the expo wound down, attendance thinned and vendors began packing up. A few speakers and attendees gathered around a campfire as the sun set over rows of trailers. The expo would go on for one more day.\n\nThe following Wednesday, the Morrison County Fair was starting.\n\nSome of the game operators were already up and running in the hopes of drumming up business from the expo.\n\nA few stragglers tried their luck at a toy gun game, the targets swapped out with pictures of zombies, and it was easy to conclude that they were probably not ready for the end.",

    "News_title":"Kirk Warns Trump: Amnesty Could Fracture MAGA Base",
    "News_text":"Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk is sounding the alarm over what he claims is growing pressure from “ruling class” donors urging President Donald Trump to trade deportations for amnesty — and warns the move could fracture the coalition that brought Trump back to the White House.\n\n“Literally the day before President Donald Trump was signing the ‘big beautiful bill,’ I got a couple phone calls from people that you would call members of the ruling class,” Kirk said on the July 7episodeofThe Charlie Kirk Show. “A lot of money and a lot of connections. They said, ‘Now, we need mass amnesty.’”\n\n“If you want to break our coalition, go and push amnesty,” Kirk said. “That right there would be a complete collapse of everything that we have worked for, everything.”\n\nKirk’s suspicions appear to align with previous statements from the President. Trump, for his part, has recently floated a plan to allow some undocumented farmworkers to stay in the country if their employers are willing to vouch for them, although he did not use the word “amnesty.”\n\n“If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people in some way… I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?” Trump said at a rally in Iowa last week. “We don’t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms.”\n\nKirk warned that amnesty would “break” the MAGA movement.\n\nTrump has proposed a pathway for farmworkers to stay if vouched for.\n\nHis administration has sent mixed signals, initially pausing farm raids, then reversing.\n\nThere is little time left to introduce and pass legislation before summer recess.\n\nTrump’s pledge marks a notable shift from his hardline campaign rhetoric and even statements made from official accounts, earlier this year. The White House Xaccountposted on May 2, “The only DEI we support:Deport Every Illegal.”\n\nThese new statements come after reports that Trump officials told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to quietly pause enforcement actions at farms, hotels, and restaurants before reversing the decision days later,The Dallas Expressreported.\n\nThe internal back-and-forth has drawn criticism from conservative activists who fear the administration may be veering toward compromise. Kirk acknowledged he still “trusts President Trump’s instincts 100 percent,” but said he was concerned by outside influence.\n\n“There is a group of people that are pushing President Trump very hard to stop the deportation effort… and to try to have some sort of a come-to-the-table moment of a bipartisan compromise,” Kirk said. “Hello, hi, I’m one of those radical right people. And I want to know what I’m not going to like.”\n\nTrump himself admitted that “serious radical right people,who I happen to like,” may not support the move, but insisted “they’ll understand.”\n\nRepresentative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus,saidlast month, “There has to be an effort to figure out how to make sure that we have the workforce we need,” listing H-2A and H-2B visas as possible options.\n\nDuring a period in 2019 when Trump reportedly considered another amnesty proposal, many of his supporters were outraged. Commentator Ann Coultertweeted, “Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!”\n\nDespite the ringing of alarm bells from Kirk and others, Trump appeared to attempt to thread a needle on June 8. The President told reporters during a press conference, “There’s no amnesty. What we’re doing is we are getting rid of criminals, but we are doing a work program [for farm labor].”\n\nBut any legislative fix may be running out of time. The House and Senate are not scheduled to be in session at the same time after July 24, a gap that will likely push any immigration bill into the fall,accordingto the congressional calendar.\n\nTrump has not specified when his proposal might be introduced.",

    "News_title":"I Was Diagnosed with Incurable Cancer. This Futuristic Treatment Could Save Me.",
    "News_text":"\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2003, I slipped on the ice leaving my office one night. My hip hurt for a year afterward, but mostly I ignored it. When the pain didn’t go away, I saw my doctor, who ordered an MRI. I went to his office, and he told me there was a tumor on my hip. I was 38 years old, pursuing a promising career in journalism, married to a woman I loved, and the first-time father of a seven-month old daughter.\n\nAt the time I was diagnosed with the type of cancer it turned out I have, a rare and incurable form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma, I was told I had eighteen months to live. That was more than twenty one years ago.\n\nIn those twenty one years, I have undergone a barrage of treatments to combat my disease. They include four rounds of radiation therapy (to my hip, neck, ribs, and nose); a six-month course of weekly intravenous immunotherapy (followed by seven years of a maintenance level of that therapy taken in pill form); another two-year round of immunotherapy involving the next-generation versions of the previous drugs I was on, in pill form; a third-round of immunotherapy involving two new immunotherapy drugs administered weekly by IV for two more years; and six years (and counting) of monthly IV infusions of an agent used to boost my immune system, which has been compromised both by my disease and the treatments used to fight it. But the most remarkable treatment I’ve had so far is a cutting-edge procedure, approved by the FDA for use in cases like mine only in 2022, called CAR-T therapy. This is the story of that treatment.\n\nThis time, I didn’t slip on the ice. I bent over to load the dishwasher and felt a stab of pain in my back. It was February of 2023. My oncologist, Dr. Sundar Jagannath at Mount Sinai hospital in New York City, ordered a series of blood tests and scans. They showed I had come out of remission again, for the seventh time. I had tumors on my hip, in my ribs, and in my thoracic and lumbar spine.\n\nOn an incongruously lovely day in March, my wife, Didi, and I met with Dr. Jagannath. My best treatment option, he explained, was a virtually brand-new, cutting-edge, almost mind-blowingly futuristic type of immunotherapy called CAR-T therapy. It would be the most powerful, and dangerous, treatment I had had to date.\n\nCAR-T therapy involves harvesting T-cells from your bloodstream, then sending them to a lab where a protein called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, is added to the surface of the T-cells (hence the acronym “CAR-T”). The CAR protein helps the T-cells recognize antigens found on the surface of specific cancer cells, in my case myeloma cells, so the T-cells can target and kill the malignant cells. The CAR-charged T-cells are then infused back into your body intravenously to do their work.\n\nCAR-T is a so-called one-and-done therapy; it requires little ongoing maintenance care, he explained. If it worked, I could go back to living a relatively normal life, at least for a time, with little or no maintenance therapy required.\n\nNaturally, there were caveats. CAR-T is by no means 100-percent effective, it requires months of preparation, some of it complex and unpleasant, and it has a number of potentially debilitating, and sometimes fatal, side effects.\n\nThe scientific definition of “chimera”—the key word in chimeric antigen receptor—is a part of the body made up of tissues of diverse genetic material, but the term has two other meanings. One is an imaginary monster made up of incongruous parts. The other is an illusion, more specifically an unrealizable dream. Both seemed apt.\n\nBecause CAR-T is a complex and highly specialized therapy, Dr. Jagannath referred me to a CAR-T specialist to manage my treatment. Didi and I had our first appointment with Dr. Shambavi Richard several weeks later.\n\nAn Indian-American woman with long black hair who favors stylish eyeglasses, Dr. Richard balances a friendly, easygoing manner with deep professional expertise.\n\nThe CAR-T preparation, she explained, was indeed complex. In my case, it would include dozens of blood tests; both a bone biopsy and a bone marrow biopsy; a procedure to harvest my T-cells; possibly more radiation if the tumors in my bones became problematic before I received my CAR-T (it takes roughly a month after the T-cell harvest for the turbocharged cells to be manufactured); a four-day hospital stay to administer a chemotherapy regimen known as DCEP meant to reduce the number of myeloma cells in your body to make the CAR-T treatment more effective; three days of an outpatient treatment called lymphodepletion, another form of chemotherapy, that kills off your existing T-cells to help the bioengineered T-cells attack the myeloma cells more effectively; and the placement of a catheter in my chest that would be used to infuse the CAR-T cells, administer related medicines, and draw blood to monitor my blood counts during the two-week hospital stay the CAR-T infusion requires.\n\nThe two most serious side effects of CAR-T therapy, she told us, are Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, occurs when the body’s immune system responds too aggressively to an infection. In the case of CAR-T therapy, the body seems to mistake the bioengineered cells for an infection, triggering the unwelcome response. The symptoms of CRS include fever and chills (“shake and bake” as some doctors call it), fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, headaches, cough, and low blood pressure. If not treated quickly, the condition can be fatal.\n\nNeurotoxicity is a broad term for a set of neurological symptoms that can include headaches, confusion, delirium, slurred or incoherent speech, seizures, and cerebral edema, or swelling of the brain. It, too, can be deadly if it isn’t treated immediately.\n\nCAR-T therapy also leaves patients seriously immunocompromised and open to infections for months and sometimes years afterward. It wipes out their immune systems so thoroughly, they eventually need to get all their childhood immunizations (mumps, measles, rubella, etc.), not to mention COVID and flu shots, again. Until they get those shots, which can’t be done until at least six months after CAR-T, they are susceptible to all those illnesses and more. During my hospital stays, I would be allowed only a limited number of visitors, and they would all have to be masked. After I went home, I would have to live more cautiously than I had been, the way we all did in the early days of COVID.\n\nDidi and I had dozens of questions. Wait, how does CAR-T work again? Would the T-cell harvest cause the same fire-ant tingling my stem-cell harvest had caused? Would I be able to attend my niece’s wedding on Cape Cod in August?\n\nIn addition to being a world-class physician, Dr. Richard is a first-rate listener. She patiently answered all our questions, told us her office would arrange the necessary appointments for us, and sent us on our way.\n\nDidi and I took a cab home. As we made our way down Fifth Avenue, we felt strangely optimistic. Action is better than inaction. And I was going to be bionic.\n\nI did the blood tests. I did the biopsies. I did the T-cell harvest. I didn’t wind up needing radiation.\n\nIn preparation for losing my hair during the two rounds of chemotherapy, I got a buzz cut. It seemed to me that losing short pieces of hair would be less traumatic than losing long strands of it. When my barber remarked it was a dramatic choice for me, I lied and said I wanted to keep cool for the summer. Then, on Thursday, May 11, I checked into Mount Sinai to start my four-day DCEP treatment.\n\n“DCEP” is a loose acronym for “Dexamethasone, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide, and Cisplatin,” the four drugs that make up the regimen. They are administered intravenously. By four o’clock that afternoon, I was ensconced in my room on the eleventh floor of the hospital and hooked up to an IV pole.\n\nBecause DCEP must be given continuously, I was attached to my IV around the clock. I have been hooked up to many IVs, and I am here to tell you that the electronic pumps used to deliver them are glitchy. The most annoying part is that the alarms the devices are equipped with, which are supposed to go off only when there is a problem with the flow of the medication, frequently go off for no reason. Every time that happens a nurse has to come, check to be sure everything is okay, and reset the pump. When you are on a pump twenty-four hours a day, this can be maddening. It is certainly not conducive to sleeping.\n\nAfter four days in the hospital, I was more than eager to go home. Physically, I felt fine. Luckily, I had tolerated the DCEP with almost no side effects. But I felt exhausted from not sleeping much and emotionally wrung out.\n\nJust after dinner on my fourth day, I was discharged.\n\nThe next morning, after my son, Oscar, had gone to school, I sat down on the couch in our living room. Didi was at the dining room table, working on her laptop.\n\n“You know what’s nice?” I said.\n\nFrom the time I had left for the hospital until that moment, I hadn’t felt especially scared or upset. Mostly, for the ninety-six hours I was at Mount Sinai, I had just put my head down and did what I needed to do.\n\nI started to answer my own question. What I had intended to say was, “Sleeping in your own bed.” But before I could finish the sentence, all the emotions I had apparently repressed over the previous four days in the hospital, or maybe the previous nineteen years, came rushing to the surface.\n\nI’m a relatively stoic person. I’m not easily overwhelmed by my problems. I’m not even particularly inclined to talk about them.\n\nWell, cancer makes liars of stoics. Just as it attacks your body, it attacks your emotional defenses, and doesn’t stop until it strips you of them. You want to put up a fight for nineteen years? That’s okay. Cancer is patient. Cancer will wait. It laughs at your perseverance. It mocks your stiff upper lip. It is amused by your courage. Eventually, it will break you. You may enter cancer as a stoic, but you will not leave as one.\n\nI started crying. Bawling, really. A deep, primal, ugly wail. It was the first time I had cried that hard since I was first diagnosed. Contrary to my stoic instincts, crying didn’t make me feel weak or ashamed. It made me feel relieved. It felt like nineteen years of weight had been lifted off my shoulders.\n\n“I missed you guys so much,” I managed to say to Didi between gasps for breath. “I am so glad to be home.”\n\nI’ve been asked if I’m afraid of dying. The answer is no, not really. Having been forced to think long and hard about the subject, I’ve come to terms with it. In my view, death is death. No heaven or hell. Just worm food. Nothingness. Why should I be afraid of nothing?\n\nWhat I am afraid of is suffering. I have seen suffering up close, in oncologists’ offices, in treatment facilities, and on cancer wards. It is decidedly scary.\n\nDuring my radiation treatments, I have seen patients with skin burns so severe they look like arson victims. During my treatment sessions, I have seen a gentleman wet his pants in his chair while he was sleeping; a woman collapse on her way to the bathroom, split her head open, and bleed all over the floor; and toilets covered in splatter from diarrhea. During my hospital stays, I have seen patients who were bald, emaciated, and as pale as the hospital-white blankets they were wrapped in to keep warm. I have heard moans, screams, and sounds I frankly don’t know how to describe. Cancer wards have been called houses of horror. I wish I could dispute the characterization.\n\nI’m also still afraid of leaving Oscar and my daughter, A.J., without a father. Not because I don’t think they’ll be okay. I have an abiding faith in them. But if there is anything hard-wired into parents of the human species, it is to provide for their offspring. To be unable to do that, even if that inability is beyond my control, would be, to me, an unforgivable failure.\n\nI’d also like to see A.J. and Oscar grow up, start their careers, and get married and have kids if they choose to. I’d like to spend my retirement with Didi, write more, fish more, play more poker, and go on more trips with family and friends.\n\nI don’t fear being dead. I fear not being alive.\n\nThe DCEP was supposed to be a lion. Physically, at least, it was a lamb. The lymphodepletion was supposed to be a lamb. It turned out to have a bite.\n\nMy treatments were scheduled for a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Sunday was left open as a rest day. Monday I would check in to the hospital for my CAR-T.\n\nLike DCEP, lymphodepletion is administered by IV, but on an outpatient basis. After my first infusion, I felt okay. After the second, I felt lousy. After the third, I felt as sick as I’ve been from any cancer treatment I’ve had. I was nauseous, dizzy, and so weak I could barely drink a glass of water or get out of bed. I had to crawl on all fours to go to the bathroom.\n\nFor better or worse, humans tend to regard a full head of hair as a sign of good health and losing one’s hair as a telltale sign of cancer. I’ve always had a good head of hair. As an adult, I’ve tended to wear it long on top and short on the sides, with one piece dangling over my forehead. Didi calls it my Superman curl.\n\nAlthough my hair had begun to fall out somewhat during the DCEP, it now fell out completely. When I showered, the shampoo lather in my hands was flecked with thousands of little pieces of black and gray stubble.\n\nThat was more upsetting than I thought it would be. My attempt to preempt that feeling by getting a buzz cut didn’t really work—some things you can’t prepare for. After almost twenty years, I had finally experienced perhaps the most familiar side effect of having cancer. Losing my hair was an unmistakable and undeniable sign of my illness, and it stung. The Superman curl was gone.\n\nAfter my final lymphodepletion treatment, I took a cab home from the hospital. It was Saturday, June 24, 2023, the day before the New York City Pride March, and because several major streets had already been blocked off, the traffic was gridlocked. A ride that might normally take forty-five minutes had already taken well over an hour, and I still had more than twenty blocks to go.\n\nAs we inched along Park Avenue South, a pickup truck pulled up alongside my cab. It was a red Ford F-150 with New Jersey plates. The driver and front-seat passenger were young men in their early twenties, wearing tank-tops and baseball caps. Bon Jovi was blasting from their speakers. If they were characters in a movie, you would have dismissed them as too on-the-nose.\n\nAs one does when one is in the middle of having one’s immune system wiped out in preparation for a futuristic cancer treatment, I was wearing a mask in the backseat of the cab and had my window down. The driver of the pickup, who was now no more than a few feet from me in the lane to my right, also had his window open. Even before he spoke, I knew what he was going to say.\n\nThe exact quote was, “Dude, lose the mask.” His wingman laughed.\n\nIn my family, we like to tell a story about my father. When I was maybe five years old, all six of us, my father, my mother, my three siblings, and I, were skiing in upstate New York. It was a particularly crowded day and there was a long line for one of the lifts.\n\nWhen a group of teenagers tried to skip to the front, my father, who was a famously gentle soul but also someone who believed in rules, called them out.\n\n“Sorry, guys,” he said. “We’ve all been waiting here a long time. You’ve got to go to the back of the line.”\n\nThe kids ignored him.\n\n“Guys, go to the back.”\n\nNothing.\n\n“Guys …”\n\nAnd then: “Fuck you, old man.”\n\nThat was it. Something inside my normally mild-mannered father snapped. He popped his boots out of his skis, walked over to the kids, and grabbed the leader of the pack by his coat lapels.\n\n“Go to the back,” he said. “Now!”\n\nAnd to the back they went.\n\nBack on Park Avenue South, I channeled my inner Gene Gluck.\n\nI got out of the cab (the traffic was stopped anyway) and walked up to the pickup truck driver.\n\nMy midstreet soliloquy went something like this: “I’m a cancer patient, asshole. I am on my way home from a chemotherapy appointment. On Monday, I’m going into the hospital for two weeks of a treatment that could kill me. I’m wearing a mask because my immune system doesn’t work. Fuck you.”\n\nIn terms of the power of my performance, it didn’t hurt that, thanks to the DCEP and lymphodepletion, I hadn’t just lost most of my hair, but I was also thin and ashen looking.\n\nIn fairness, the second I stepped out of the cab, the driver seemed to sense what was happening, and once I confirmed his suspicion, he seemed genuinely remorseful.\n\n“Sorry, dude,” he said. “My bad.”\n\nI got back in the cab and he and his sidekick turned right at the next cross street, I suspect to avoid having to inch along next to me any longer.\n\nI usually don’t believe in playing the cancer card. In most situations, it’s too powerful a tool for the job, not to mention manipulative. But on that day, I made an exception.\n\nOn Monday, June 26, I checked into Mount Sinai again, this time to receive my CAR-T treatment. The doctors and nurses explained to Didi and me that the infusion itself would be painless and only take half an hour or so.\n\nAfter that, they would carefully monitor me—at first every fifteen minutes, then every half an hour, then every hour, and several times a day after that—for symptoms of CRS and neurotoxicity for the duration of my two-week hospital stay.\n\nThe CRS monitoring would involve blood tests and temperature and blood-pressure checks. The neurotoxicity screening would entail asking me if I knew my name, what day it was, what city I was in, and so on, and handwriting tests to track my motor skills.\n\nAs we had been told before, I would be allowed only a limited number of visitors, and everyone was required to wear a mask. I came equipped with two novels, three books of crossword puzzles, and my Netflix, Hulu, and Peacock subscriptions. My sisters and brother sent me a picture of the four of us from a family wedding to keep by my bedside.\n\nI planned to work while I was in the hospital. Dr. Richard supported it. It would help me keep my mind off of things, she said. To keep Zoom meetings from being creepy, I would either keep my camera off or customize my background to something other than a hospital room.\n\nWhen the time came, one of the nurses wheeled in an IV pole with the bag containing my CAR-T cells hanging from it. The fluid in the bag was colorless and generally unremarkable, like so much water. I remember wondering how something so extraordinary could look so plain.\n\nThen the nurse took the plastic line running from the bag and attached it to the catheter that had been placed in my chest earlier in the day. I watched the first few drops dangle from the valve at the bottom of the IV bag, then break loose and travel down the line into my veins.\n\nDidi was sitting next to my bed, in the visitor’s chair.\n\n“Okay, cells,” she said. “Work.”\n\nFor the first few days of my hospital stay, I felt fine. Not that I was having the time of my life or anything. The temperature checks, blood-pressure checks, blood draws, and cognitive-function tests were incessant.\n\n“Are you in any pain?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’m going to take your blood pressure now.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“And now your temperature.”\n\n“Sure.”\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI’ve been stuck with needles hundreds of times. I’m used to it. But being awakened every night at midnight and 3 a.m. to get jabbed was new to me.\n\nShowering was a Catch-22. Because of the catheter, I wasn’t allowed to take a standard shower because I could develop an infection, but because of my compromised immunity, I needed to keep my skin clean to avoid infections. The prescribed solution was a special kind of disinfecting wipes that are safe to use every day on your skin. I can report they are a poor replacement for a shower.\n\nFor the cognitive tests, one of the doctors or nurses would ask me to write “my sentence,” a copy of a sentence they had me write on the first day as a baseline so they could monitor my fine motor skills. My sentence was, “Today I ate breakfast, watched TV, read a book, and took a walk down the hallway.” Shakespeare!\n\nThen a doctor or nurse would ask me a series of questions.\n\n“What’s your name?”\n\n“Jonathan Gluck.”\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n“Mount Sinai Hospital.”\n\n“In what city?”\n\n“New York.”\n\n“How old are you?”\n\n“Fifty-eight.”\n\n“What is that?” [Pointing to the television.]\n\n“A television.”\n\nEtc.\n\nFinally, they would ask me to raise my right hand, touch my finger to my nose, or some such.\n\nOn the third or fourth day, when one of the nurses asked me to raise my hand, I didn’t immediately do so.\n\nShe paused.\n\n“Are you okay, Jonathan?” she asked.\n\n“You didn’t say, ‘Simon says,’” I said.\n\nFor the record, she laughed.\n\nBoredom was another issue.\n\nTo pass the time, I binge watched season two ofThe Bear.(Excellent). I read two books written by former colleagues (Bad Summer People, by Emma Rosenblum, andThe Eden Test, by Adam Sternbergh). I finished three compilations ofNew York Timescrossword puzzles (my crossword game was never stronger). And I watched literally every minute of the Tour de France, more than eighty hours of televised bicycle racing. (Check out Jonas Vingegaard’s thrilling Stage 16 time-trial win, in which he deals a decisive blow to longtime rival Tadej Pogačar, on YouTube.) Because watching sports on TV has always been a kind of Prozac for me, I threw in a few dozen Wimbledon matches (delighted for Carlos Alcaraz, sad for Ons Jabeur), the women’s U.S. Open golf tournament (congratulations to first-time major winner Allisen Corpuz), and a nightly dose of Yankees and Mets games (all equally and pleasantly boring) for good measure. Regarding the question of whether I watched a cornhole tournament on ESPN, I plead the fifth. (Go, Jamie Graham!)\n\nIf you are sensing a theme of escapism, you are not wrong. During my hospital stay for my DCEP treatment, I had readEndurance, Alfred Lansing’s account of the ill-fated Shackleton expedition. I thought the epic story of survival might inspire me (at least I wasn’t stranded on an Antarctic ice floe eating seal blubber to survive), and to some extent it did. But it was also maybe a little too intense. My own saga, I decided, was harrowing enough.\n\nI will spare you my complaints about hospital food. Actually, I won’t. But I will limit them to the coffee. The coffee was horrible. Ghastly. Arguably evil. In fact, I hesitate to dignify it by calling it coffee. It was instant Nescafé, the kind they package in those skinny little packets to make them look European, dumped into a Styrofoam cupful of lukewarm water. You know the little puddles that form on the side of the road after a rainstorm, the ones with the rainbow-colored oil slicks on their surface? The coffee didn’t taste like that; it tasted worse. Have you ever forgotten to change the water filter under your kitchen sink for three years, until the filter is so saturated with dirt and bacteria it could qualify as a Superfund site? Imagine wringing out that filter and drinking the afterproduct. Then account for the fact that the coffee tasted ten times as bad.\n\nPut it this way. On Day Four, I began sneaking down to the Starbucks in the hospital lobby, despite the infection risk that posed, to get my caffeine fix. In other words, the hospital coffee was so bad I risked my life not to drink it.\n\nOn the bright side, because I was now severely immunocompromised, I was assigned a single room. That meant I had many hours to myself. Didi has confided in me that she sometimes likes to go on business trips because staying in a hotel room by herself offers her a rare escape from the demands of me, the kids, the cats, and everything else. It’s precious alone time. That thought may or may not have crossed my mind.\n\nOne morning, when I was heading back to my room after getting coffee in the lobby, I came across a yellow sticky note placed next to the Up and Down buttons on an elevator.\n\nIt read: “Every day above earth is a Good Day! Xoxo.”\n\nTo the person who wrote that note, I say, “Amen.”\n\nDischarge day was Tuesday, July 11. I had a final check-in (“Are you in any pain?”), my catheter was removed, and I was free to go.\n\nDidi had brought a bag full of makeup, nail polish, and face creams as a thank you gift for the nursing staff. We left it with the chief nurse and headed straight for the exits, as they say on the hospital TV shows,stat.\n\nOn our way to the elevators, I ran into a woman I’ll call Barbara. Barbara was a fellow CAR-T patient and one of the hall walkers. Scratch that. She was the hall walker. She was out there every day, marching back and forth, for an hour or longer, at a clip at least triple that of any of the rest of us. She was maybe sixty-five years old and had a strong, calm air about her. It seemed to say, “I am aware of your power, cancer. But I’m sorry, you will not defeat me.”\n\nIt was obvious I was leaving; I had my suitcase with me.\n\nPreviously, Barbara and I had chatted a few times and exchanged small talk. But at that moment, we didn’t need to speak. We understood each other perfectly, almost telepathically. What each of us was saying to the other was, “I’m sorry. I understand. Good luck.”\n\nAdapted fromAn Exercise in Uncertainty, Harmony Books 2025\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nKid Cudi Is All Right\n\n16 Best Shoe Organizers For Storing and Displaying Your Kicks",

    "News_title":"Trial by jury is a vital freedom. It must not be removed",
    "News_text":"The old legal maxim that justice delayed is justice denied has rarely been more appropriate than it is today. Theworsening backlog in the courtsmeans cases are taking years to come to trial. This leaves alleged miscreants in limbo either on extended bail or periods of custodial remand which is itself an affront to justice.\n\nIt also means that victims are left waiting too long for punishments to be meted out for the offences against them. Close to 77,000 cases are pending in the Crown Court in England and Wales.\n\nA review by Sir Brian Leveson, a former High Court judge, has proposed that in order to clear the backlog, thousands of cases that would normally be heard in front of a juryshould be decided by judges alone.\n\nHe said that without a fundamental reform the system faced total collapse. Sir Brian also called for more out of court settlements, such as a greater use of cautions, and for some inmates to serve just a small part of the term handed down.\n\nThere is unquestionably a crisis in the system but whether Sir Brian’s proposed solutions are the right approach is another matter. There is adanger of replacing one injustice with another. Many thousands of so-called “either way” cases are already heard by magistrates alone so there is no absolute requirement for juries.\n\nNonetheless, to remove even more from the scrutiny of juries is to deny access to a cornerstone of English justice and should be resisted whatever the apparent logistical attraction. The ancient right, dating to Magna Carta, to be tried by one’s peers should not lightly be discarded.\n\nOther remedies must be considered, including sitting throughout the summer rather than taking a two-month recess. How can that be justified in such a crisis is hard to understand. If the courts are full, cannot other public buildings be used as temporary venues in which judges and juries can sit? Why can’t more retired judges, made to leave office aged 70, be recruited back to the colours? Should all judges and juries not sit around the clock until the backlog is cleared?\n\nMoreover, the suggestion that more crimes should be dealt with by a caution is to further diminish theimportance of deterrence in our system, already undermined by reduced jail terms and early release. Most offences are committed by a small number of repeat felons. If they think they can get away with just a ticking-off they will not be dissuaded from a life of crime.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"This farce shows how far Britain and France have fallen",
    "News_text":"Goodbye Britain, land of Churchill, individual liberty, the Industrial Revolution and the abolition of slavery; au revoir France, home of de Gaulle, meritocracy, rationalism and 365 kinds of cheese.Two glorious countries, divided by a common history.Bonjour instead to the dystopian nightmare of Frangleterre, a couple of failed states for the price of one, both locked into an economic, cultural and social doom spiral.\n\nHaving diverged in the 1980s and 1990s, France and Britain are converging again, despite Brexit, copying each other’s worst pathologies, fromhigh taxto wokery, from fiscal incontinence to bad food: the only question is which implodes first.\n\nSir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are doing their best to win that race with their idiotic, destructive and nihilistic policies, but it will go down to the wire. Both nations are drastically diminished, their armed forces cut back to the bone, their geopolitical retreat accelerating (inBritain’s case with the Chagos fiasco, in France’s with its expulsion from Africa), their economies barely growing, their industries hollowed out, their welfare states horrendously expensive.\n\nThe state visit has proved to be a pathetic jamboree, a tragic spectacle where the feeblest of hosts (Starmer) has encouraged the most pompous of guests (Macron) to cosplay great power politics, to lecture us on Brexit, on the case for anti-Americanism, on our failings over immigration andeven on recognising a state of Palestine. Even Macron’s inevitable philosophy lesson was a mangling of intellectual history, conflating the Scottish and French enlightenments, what Hayek called real and false individualism.\n\nThe French President was right that Britain must do a lot more to tackle the demand-side factors attracting illegal immigration to the UK, but he was also guilty of staggering hypocrisy. Why doesn’t France deport all of its illegal migrants? Why allow them to live in illicit tent cities? Why implicitly share in the lie, for the purposes of asylum, that France isn’t a “safe” state?\n\nMacron would rather illegal migrants didn’t gather in Calais, but hedoesn’t care enough to do anything meaningful about it(the puncturing of a migrant boat last week was a publicity-friendly one off). The one in, one out plan will most likely fail; the pilot will be too small to change the calculus of immigrants or people smugglers. The British side is too naive, too desperate not to have to think aboutquitting the ECHR: Britain could fix the migrant crisis alone, but it finds it easier to beg the French for help. The grovelling is disgusting, and must stop.\n\nStarmer, along with the rest of the British Left, has suffered from a misplaced France envy since the days of Francois Mitterand. The Labour party (and the Blob more generally) cannot see a French tax or public project it doesn’t want to copy, and is blind to the destructive side-effects on jobs, social mobility and growth. Starmer’s labour market regulations are a typical product of this blinkered francophilia, as is theLeft’s dalliance with wealth taxes. These were a disaster in France, but this won’t stop Labour.\n\nMacron played our useless negotiators beautifully after Brexit andduring Covid, threatening and bullying us. Instead of fighting back, which is what a proper self-respecting country would have done, we kept turning the other cheek, and now Starmer is surrendering on all fronts, handing over fisheries and cash. Theforthcoming “youth” mobility sell-outwill be especially toxic: it will become a source of mass immigration by stealth.\n\nThe Franco-British convergence will see both sides adopt the worst ideas and attitudes of the other. Take strikes: resident doctorsare demanding a 29 per cent pay rise, less than a year after they were handed 22 per cent. Consider law and order: our court system is so overwhelmed thatLabour might suspend trials by jury, a typically British safeguard.\n\nOr take education: Macron has destroyed France’s state schools, whose rankings are plummeting on the Pisa scores; not to be undone, Starmer is crucifying our private schools, academies and free schools. Macron is copying Britain with respect to the demographic collapse: there are more people alive and living in France today who were born in 1946 than children born in 2024. The new Franco-British approach to net zero, tax, spend and the economy is proving equally toxic. Car production collapsed 71 per cent in France between 1999 and 2024; Britain has suffered a 54 per cent slump.\n\nMacron has racked up massive deficits and an unsustainable debt. Starmer is on the case:the OBR has warned that “the scale and array of risks to the UK fiscal outlook remains daunting”. The UK’s debt has risen by 24 per cent of GDP over the past 15 years and by 60 per cent over the past 20. The UK is now saddled with the sixth-highest debt, fifth-highest deficit, and third-highest borrowing costs among 36 advanced economies; once a paragon of virtue, we are now in France’s league of horrors.\n\nFor years now, France has struggled with the integration of immigrants, the rise of Islamism and the scourge of anti-Semitism. Despite our own, massive problems, Britain used to have a better record, but we are now going the way of France. The share of immigrants in the population of England and Wales has hit 16.8 per cent, against 10.3 per cent in France.\n\nThere are things we could, but won’t, learn from France. Its infrastructure isn’t what it was – the French are scathing about the TGV – but it remains immensely better. The UK has built 65 miles of new motorways since 2014, and 422 miles since 1990. During that later period, the French added 3,057 miles.\n\nThe Gallic healthcare system has deteriorated, but remains superior to the NHS. There were just 132,000 new housing starts in the UK last year; the French are angry because their own housebuilding has collapsed to just below 300,000. The French have 7 million more homes than we have: millions of families enjoy second homes that are rationed in Britain.\n\nThe decline and fall of the UK and France, two wonderful countries whose fate is inextricably linked, is one of the tragedies of our times. I am a citizen of both Britain and France, so I feel the pain especially deeply. For the sake of all of us who care, let us hope it isn’t already too late.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Arkansas leaders call for improved flood preparedness, communication following deadly Texas flash flood",
    "News_text":"LITTLE ROCK, Ark – In the wake of the deadly flash flooding in Texas that claimed multiple lives and caused significant destruction, Arkansas lawmakers are calling for a renewed focus on emergency preparedness, communication infrastructure, and floodplain management in outdoor recreation areas.\n\nThe calls come as memories remain fresh of similar tragedies in Arkansas, including the 2010 Albert Pike flood and recent incidents in the Ozarks.\n\nArkansas emergency responder discusses the dangers of Texas flood\n\nRep. Bruce Westerman, who represents Arkansas’s 4th Congressional District and is the lead sponsor of the federal “EXPLORE Act”, highlighted the need for balancing outdoor recreation with safety.\n\n“I authored the EXPLORE Act—it’s an outdoor recreation bill that impacts areas across the country, and part of that includes rebuilding the Albert Pike Campground above the 100-year floodplain,” Westerman said. “But anytime you recreate outdoors, you’re taking a risk. The public understands that.”\n\nWesterman emphasized the importance of improved communication systems in remote areas, noting that the bill also contains provisions to expand broadband in national parks and rural regions. However, he cautioned against assuming all risks can be eliminated.\n\n“It’s probably not realistic to think we’ll get high-speed communication in every remote area anytime soon,” he said. “It comes back to being prepared and making wise decisions—knowing the forecast, being aware of your surroundings.”\n\nSenator Missy Irvin, who represents District 24—home to many rural and flood-prone areas like Searcy, Stone and Van Buren counties—announced during a recent Arkansas Legislative Council subcommittee meeting that the state will undertake a “comprehensive review” of its emergency warning and response protocols.\n\n“We’ve experienced tragedies like Texas—both at Albert Pike and in my district,” Irvin said. “Last July, South Sylamore Creek flooded and pushed RVs down the creek and into the White River. It’s critical we review what our technology is, what our protocols are and where we’re lacking.”\n\nWhat we know about victims of devastating Texas floods\n\nIrvin stressed the importance of using existing tools like the A1 Emergency Alert System, water-level sensors and early warning alerts more effectively, especially in rural and remote locations with poor cell phone coverage. She said coordination across all levels of government—federal, state and local—as well as private stakeholders, is essential.\n\n“We need signage, clear alerts and education for people using our public lands. Arkansas is the Natural State—we’re beautiful but rural. People need a kind of ‘user’s guide’ for staying safe outdoors,” she said.\n\nIrvin also pointed to long-term challenges like “bank destabilization” and post-flood hazards. A recent incident at Jack’s Fishing Post in Mountain View—nine months after a flood—saw tree roots collapse due to compromised riverbanks, Irvin said.\n\n“It’s not just the flooding event,” she said. “The aftermath and cleanup are also dangerous. We need short-term and long-term protocols to protect lives and land.”\n\nBoth lawmakers acknowledged the devastation in Texas and emphasized the importance of learning from neighboring states’ experiences. Irvin praised the Arkansas National Guard for sending aid, while Westerman underscored the need for realistic safety measures—not blanket closures of natural areas.\n\n“If we shut down every place where someone was injured or killed, we’d close the Grand Canyon,” Westerman said. “We need to manage risk, not eliminate access.”\n\n‘It’s sobering’: Volunteers search debris for bodies after Texas flooding\n\nAs Arkansas continues to expand its recreational infrastructure and outdoor tourism, both leaders agree that safety, communication and preparedness must remain top priorities in dealing with extreme weather events.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The workers stepped inside a metal compartment that was lifted by a crane to the surface.\n\nAround 9:20 p.m., all 31 workers were safely extricated and accounted for. Many were seen hugging each other. No injuries were reported as paramedics evaluated each person at the scene.\n\nThe wastewater tunnel site is part of the L.A. County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, which spans seven miles and is being “constructed to protect local waterways by addressing aging infrastructure,”according to the project’s website.The tunnel would be used to transport treated wastewater to the ocean.\n\nL.A. Mayor Karen Bass also arrived at the scene andreleased a statement on X,saying, “I just spoke with many of the workers who were trapped.

    "News_title":"Quantum Breakthrough Could Make Your Devices 1,000 Times Faster",
    "News_text":"Your days of being frustrated by a sluggish smartphone or laptop could be coming to an end: scientists have discovered a new technique for controlling electronic states inquantum materialsthat could eventually make our gadgets up to 1,000 times faster.\n\nQuantum materialsare those that display strange behaviors and properties governed by quantum mechanics. They provide a glimpse into a separate realm of physics, where the standard lawsdon't apply.\n\nHere, researchers from institutions across the US manipulated the temperature of a layered quantum material called 1T-TaS₂, enabling it to instantly shift between two opposite electronic phases: insulation and conduction. That ability to block or allow the flow of electricity is key to how transistors incomputer chipswork.\n\nOf course it's a long journey from a physics lab to consumer electronics, but the technology has the potential to transform theclock speedsof the processors in our gadgets – essentially, how quickly they run.\n\nRelated:Microsoft Claims a Major Quantum Breakthrough, But What Does It Do?\n\n\"Everyone who has ever used a computer encounters a point where they wish something would load faster,\"saysphysicist Gregory Fiete, from Northeastern University.\n\n\"There's nothing faster than light, and we're using light to control material properties at essentially the fastest possible speed that's allowed by physics.\"\n\nEvery electronic device requires both conductive andinsulating materials, which then need to be linked together. If this technology can be developed, we'll have a smaller, faster, single material that can be controlled by light to switch between the two states.\n\nThe researchers call their process \"thermal quenching\". The material 1T-TaS₂ haspreviously shownpromise in switching between a conductor and an insulator, but the breakthrough here is doing so at more practical temperatures, rather than cryogenic ones, and for months at a time rather than seconds.\n\nKey to those improvements were the heating and cooling approach used by the researchers, and the timing of the temperature changes: fast enough to be effective, but not so fast that the necessaryquantum statescollapse.\n\n\"One of the grand challenges is, how do you control material properties at will?\"saysFiete. \"What we're shooting for is the highest level of control over material properties. We want it to do something very fast, with a very certain outcome, because that's the sort of thing that can be then exploited in a device.\"\n\nSilicon semiconductor components have of course served us well for decades, but we're nowapproaching the physical limitsof what these chips can offer. As such, manufacturers are looking foralternative options.\n\nWhile the techniques used with 1T-TaS₂ here are nowhere near ready to stuff inside our gadgets right now, they do open potential paths towards different types of components and different approaches to electronics that can provide serious performance jumps in the years to come.\n\n\"We're at a point where in order to get amazing enhancements in information storage or the speed of operation, we need a new paradigm,\"saysFiete.\n\n\"Quantum computingis one route for handling this, and another is to innovate in materials. That's what this work is really about.\"\n\nThe research has been published inNature Physics.\n\nNew Viral Indie Rock Sensation Reveals They're 100% AI\n\nChatGPT: 5 Surprising Truths About How AI Chatbots Actually Work\n\nYou Can Now Rent a Flesh Computer Grown in a British Lab",

Some were born into that privilege, while others fight for the right to claim it for themselves. For them, the moment it becomes official is among the most important in their lifetimes.\n\nOn July 2, The Palm Beach Post published a collection of stories titled \"They Choose America,\" showcasing those who chose to become U.S. citizens amid President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdowns. Their faces, photographed moments after each took the Oath of Allegiance, filled The Post's front page on July 3.\n\nPalm Beach Post reporters Hannah Phillips, Maya Washburn and Valentina Palm attended naturalization ceremonies in West Palm Beach and Miami to hear their stories.\n\nThey hail from countries as close as Mexico, Cuba and Venezuela and as far as Ukraine, Latvia and Vietnam. Some arrived fleeing political collapse. Others followed love, ambition or the promise of safety for their children.\n\nMany said Trump's promises of mass deportation had pushed them to complete the naturalization process. Others said their families had counted down the years and days from them to become citizens. Some said they yearned to have the right to vote and one day run for public office.\n\nThose who'd planted deep roots in the country stood shoulder to shoulder with those just beginning to settle.

    "News_title":"A partial tunnel collapse in Los Angeles left dozens of workers trapped about 400 feet below ground. They all survived",
    "News_text":"Thirty-one men working on a tunnel about 400 feet beneath the ground in Los Angeles were operating a machine to carve through the earth.\n\nWithout warning, a portion of the tunnel collapsed around them Wednesday night.\n\nTrapped five miles from the tunnel’s only entry and exit point, the men scrambled to escape.\n\nThe tunnel, roughly 18 feet wide and seven miles long, had been under construction for years as part of a complex municipal wastewater project, one that demands highly skilled workers capable of managing intricate technical challenges–and responding effectively to potential emergencies.\n\nAs anxiety gripped officials, families and loved ones, rescue teams raced against time to reach the men.\n\nMeanwhile, stranded deep underground, the men climbed over a 12- to 15-foot-high mound of loose soil to try and reach their coworkers on the other side.\n\nFrom there, they were transported by tunnel vehicle to the access point, the fire department said.\n\nMore than 100 Los Angeles Fire Department responders raced to the scene in the city’s Wilmington neighborhood to assist in the operation, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Basssaid on X.\n\nThree of those trapped workers were Arally Orozco’s brothers. She was attending church when her phone rang over and over again.\n\nMoments later, she received a text from her son, alerting her that the tunnel where her brothers worked had collapsed, The Associated Press reported. “It was sad and scary,” she told AP in Spanish. “We feared the worst.”\n\nAs officials, families and loved ones of the workers waited anxiously, rescue workers tried to reach the men.\n\nFirefighters used cranes and rescue cages to hoist several workers out, according to video fromCNN affiliate KCBS\/KCAL.\n\nOne of Orozco’s brothers was finally able to reach her. They were able to squeeze through a tight space to get out, he told her in tears.\n\n“My brother was crying,” Orozco said, according to AP. “He told me he thought he was going to die underground.”\n\nThose rescued didn’t have any visible injuries, the LAFD said in astatement.\n\nThe rescued workers were traumatized but thankful to be alive, Los Angeles County Board Supervisor Janice Hahn said at a news conference late Wednesday.\n\n“We got to meet many of the men who were alive and happy, but they were all shaken up,” Hahn said. “It was quite traumatic for them to go through that.”\n\n“The first thing they did was call their family members,” she added. “They were also light about it, like you would expect when you’re in a situation that’s very tense that you know could have ended in a tragedy, and it didn’t. There’s a celebratory sense that people made it out.”\n\nThe project will be placed on hold indefinitely until officials complete their investigation and safety and engineering assessments for structural integrity, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts spokesperson Michael Chee told CNN.\n\nThe failure occurred when workers – mostly engineers, electricians and mechanics – were operating the tunnel boring machine and a section they had already built collapsed due to “squeezing ground,” Robert Ferrante, chief engineer and general manager of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, said at the news conference.\n\nSqueezing ground occurs when the ground or soil deforms significantly during an excavation.\n\n“I have never seen a collapse of structural integrity of this nature,” Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Danny Wu told CNN. “We’ve had small accidents with vehicles inside, or small fires or whatnot, but nothing this catastrophic where a section of the tunnel has failed.”\n\nWith only a single entry and exit point, Wu said he was “expecting the worst” and rescuers were braced to handle severe trauma injuries during the operation.\n\nTo escape the tunnel, the men had to return to the point of collapse and walk through it before getting into a vehicle that brought them out to the shaft site, according to Ferrante.\n\n“It was a tense situation. Anytime you have a collapse in a tunnel behind you, there was only one way out at that time, it’s to come back here to the shaft, so they had to come back and make their way through the damaged section of the tunnel,” Ferrante said.\n\n“It was very scary, as I just want to reiterate, we’re very fortunate,” he said.\n\nThe workers were highly skilled, well-trained and able to immediately recognize what steps to take in the emergency situation, Tim McOsker, the current councilman for Los Angeles City Council District 15, said at the news conference.\n\n“This is a highly technical, difficult project, and they knew exactly what to do. They knew how to secure themselves,” McOsker said. “They knew how to get to the train that brought them back. They knew all of the signals as we spoke to them.”\n\nMcOsker and Hahn haverequestedan investigation into the cause of the failure and a full report on the safe repair of the tunnel to the LA County Sanitation Districts.\n\nThe tunnel being built is part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts’ Clearwater Project, which is designed to replace two large tunnels that carry treated wastewater to the ocean.\n\nThe current tunnels, which are 60 and 80 years old, are not up to current earthquake standards and “cannot be taken out of service because they must continuously carry flow,”according to the county’s website.\n\nThese tunnels are part of the county’s main sewer system that treats wastewater from more than five million people in the Los Angeles Basin. The new tunnel will be seven miles long and “constructed almost entirely underneath public right-of-way (streets),” with completion expected in 2027, according to the website.\n\nCNN’s Josh Campbell contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Despite research, WV counties refuse to fund harm reduction with opioid funds",
    "News_text":"On June 6, 2025, Laura Jones goes through boxes of Easy Touch syringes to be distributed by Milan Puskar Health Right in Morgantown, West Virginia, which operates one of only three syringe exchange programs in West Virginia. (Photo by Ty McClung\/West Virginia University)\n\nOn a warm summer day in late May, about 100 people are waiting for their turn to go inside theNeighborhood S.H.O.P., located in the annex of Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church on the West Side of Charleston, West Virginia.\n\nInside the S.H.O.P. — which stands for Showers Healthcare Outreach Program — they will find resources like naloxone, clothing, first-aid supplies, food, showers and people offering services from rental to legal assistance. Director Derek Hudson says the no-barrier organization aids almost 2,000 people a month.\n\n“The whole goal is to have people come in, be heard and know that at least someone is trying to help them,” Hudson said.\n\nThe kind of help the S.H.O.P. provides, broadly speaking, is harm reduction.\n\n“Harm reduction for us focuses on meeting people where they are and empowering them with the tools to help prevent negative health outcomes from substance use,” Hudson explained. “Harm reduction, simply put, saves lives.”\n\nWhat they won’t find inside, however, is one of the most well-known forms of harm reduction: new syringes.\n\nSyringe Service Programs are highly regulated in the state of West Virginia, and service providers say it makes it almost impossible to run one. But SSPs are associated with anapproximately 50% reduction in HIV and HCV incidence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also benefit communities and public safety by reducing needlestick injuries and overdose deaths.\n\nHudson’s S.H.O.P. has received about$80,000 in state opioid settlement fundsfrom the West Virginia First Foundation specifically to create a re-entry program that will house people who are coming out of incarceration. It’s a program that will reduce recidivism and homelessness in the community, Hudson says, but it is not considered a harm reduction program.\n\nPrograms that provide more typical harm reduction in the form ofpractical strategies that reduce the negative consequences of drug use— which can include anything from free naloxone to wound care — are not receiving any of the tens of millions of dollars coming into state, county and city level government coffers in West Virginia fromthe 2021 global opioid lawsuit settlement agreementso far, according to an analysis by students from West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media of Freedom of Information Act responses from 50 of the state’s 55 counties. And without those funds, many of the people working to provide these services worry that disease transmission and overdose death rateswill buck a national trendand rise in West Virginia once again.\n\nThe funds are the result of a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,more than 720,000 people died from an opioid overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2022. West Virginia saw its peak in 2022, when 1,335, or75 out of every 100,000 people,died of an overdose.\n\nWest Virginia will receive about$980 million in total from the settlement agreement,split into payments over 18 years, with larger payments coming up front.The West Virginia First Foundation—a nonprofit created by the state Legislature — will control the spending of 72.5% of the funds, local governments 24.5%, and the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office 3%. AMemorandum of Understandingdictates what the money can be spent on, ranging fromlaw enforcement,prevention education, treatment and recovery to harm reduction.\n\nIn 2023, more than$73.5 millionof those fundswere distributed to county officialsin the state’s 55 counties. An analysis of FOIA responses by journalism students at West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media lacks information for five counties, but of the 50 others, Logan County received the highest distribution at $3,983,631, and Jefferson County received the least at $62,773.\n\nKanawha County, where the state’s capital Charleston is located, received just more than $3.9 million, and, according to County Commissioner Lance Wheeler, is focusing on funding recovery options. But Wheeler says they are also considering funding harm reduction organizations as well.\n\n“This is something I strongly support,” Wheeler said. “We’re going to continue to do that, helping those who have a track record of success and those who are helping people who are struggling.”\n\nHarm reduction has a long, complicated history in Kanawha County and Charleston. With a population of 47,000, Charleston is the largest city in the state. It also had thehighest overdose rate per capita in the entire country in 2022.\n\nThe city health department started a syringe service program in 2015, but was open for just three years before public and political pressure forced the city to shut it down. Then-mayor Danny Jones, a Republican, called the program a“mini-mall for junkies and drug dealers.”\n\nThe program’s closure in 2018, however, had dire consequences for public health.HIV and hepatitis rates skyrocketed, eventually requiring CDC officials to travel to Charleston in 2021 to help the city contain the outbreak.\n\nThen-CDC HIV Prevention Chief Dr. Demetre Daskalakiscalled the outbreak“the most concerning HIV outbreak in the United States.”\n\nIris Sidikman, the harm reduction coordinator at the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia, said the reluctance to fund harm-reduction services has directly impacted organizations that go beyond providing syringe services.\n\n“When you have a tool to give someone in a non-judgmental space, it can open a world of possibilities,” Sidikman said.\n\nIn 2024, the Women’s Health Center applied to the Kanawha County Commissionfor $250,000 inopioid settlement funds twice, first through an online application and again at a public commission meeting. The clinic intended to use some the funds to provide increased naloxone training and education, cover costs related to screening and treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C and to fund a portion of clinical and programmatic staff salaries for the Harm Reduction Program, Sidikman said. Their application was denied without explanation.\n\nThe Women’s Health Center also applied with Charleston City Council in August 2023 to create a syringe service program on Charleston’s West Side, but was denied due to fear of an “increase in drug use and crime.”\n\nResearch on harm reduction by theSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrationhas shown that these practices reduce disease transmission and overdose rates, and experts believe politicians should look at the numbers more often.\n\n“What we want to do with data analysis… is to be able to produce the evidence to show to political power that these interventions are working and capable, they are saving many lives,” said RTI International Research and Public Health Analyst Barrett Montgomery.\n\nSOAR WV, another grassroots, Charleston-based harm reduction group, works to promote the health, dignity and voices of individuals who are impacted by substance use disorders, according to itswebsite. SOAR and other organizations picked up the task of providing new syringes until the state Legislature passedSenate Bill 334in 2021, which included strict regulations for running a syringe service program, such as requiring a West Virginia state ID in order to participate.\n\nThe city of Charleston also passed stipulations requiring that each syringe be uniquely labeled for tracking purposes.\n\nAs of June 2025, West Virginia Health Right operates the only syringe-service program in Charleston, but according to one source, “doesn’t even begin to make a dent in the problem.”\n\nThe political appetite is lacking because of a lack of information around the subject, says Dr. Susan Margaret Murphy, president of the Drug Intervention Institute in Charleston.\n\n“Unfortunately, we are in a political climate where I don’t think research and scientific knowledge necessarily pleads the case. So sometimes it’s got to be kind of a heart-on-the-sleeve storytelling type of approach,” she said.\n\nIn neighboring Boone County, Commissioner Brett Kuhn agreed.\n\nThe county currently does not have any harm reduction services, and, so far, its three elected commissioners have not spent any of their $2.9 million in opioid settlement funds to provide them.\n\n“I think in a rural setting, you’re going to see more pushback than you would in more of an urban setting,” Kuhn said. “I think with the syringes, it’s like people think we’re subsidizing the drug use, whereas with naloxone the attitude is more like, ‘well, we’re trying to help somebody that’s in trouble.’ And really, if you look at it, in both cases, is there any real difference between the two?”\n\nKuhn says that informing the public about how harm reduction works and its benefits to the community is key to fighting pushback.\n\n“You’ve got to get out ahead of the curve. You’ve got to get out there and get the information out,” Kuhn said. “I sometimes think we don’t do a good enough job of that.”\n\nKuhn said his county experienced the brunt of the nation’s opioid overdose epidemic firsthand. Its opioid mortality rate in 2023 was 82.0 per 100,000, the second-highest rate in West Virginia,according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources.\n\nInstead of harm reduction programs, the county spent its funds onpaying off its regional jail bill, supporting a food pantry, a county arrest record-keeping system, a rapid response vehicle for EMTs, and a 25-bed expansion at Hero House, a faith-based sober living home in Madison.\n\nKuhn and officials in other counties say the vague nature of the state’s MOU overviewing how the money can be spent puts the duty of interpretation on local officials. The county did not hold special community meetings or town halls to gather input on how to spend the funds.\n\nBut Kuhn says it’s rebuilding a sense of community that could help garner support for harm reduction services.\n\n“I think it’s sometimes the attitude is ‘well, those people don’t want to help themselves,’” Kuhn said, “[but] if they don’t want to help themselves, then what do I need to do to try to help? And I think in a certain sense, we’ve lost that sense of community, that we’re all in this together.”\n\nKuhn hopes that can change in the future.\n\nJonathan Edwards, Purity Siroir, Tyler Cummings and Aengus Gillespie contributed to this reporting.\n\nThis story was published in partnership with West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media and Communications, with support from Scott Widmeyer.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_title":"Trial of the century: Why 100 years later, the Scopes case still matters",
    "News_text":"DAYTON, TN – Inside a sweltering courtroom in July, a fierce debate was underway here in this small Tennessee town.\n\nModern science versus religion and the battle over what is taught inside America’s public schools and how.\n\nThe legal titans squared off against each other: A former member of Congress and three-time presidential candidate up against one of the most prominent defense attorneys of his day.\n\nThey sparred over science and the Bible. They tried to match wits. One even argued to the death.\n\nIt was, no doubt, the trial of the century.\n\nNow, 100 years after what became known as the Scopes Monkey Trial in July 1925, the nation once again is fiercely debating what America’s children are taught and how – from race and LGBTQ+ books to major pushes to put religion back into public school classrooms.\n\n“Scopes was the first-ever battle in the culture wars,” said Edward Larson, a historian and the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Summer For the Gods: The Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion.”\n\n“We may not be fighting about creation and evolution now, but the larger battles still continue.”\n\nIn March 1925, Tennessee became the first state in the country to ban the teaching of evolution amid the quickly-evolving early 20th century social landscape with the passage of the Butler Act.\n\nThe law made it a misdemeanor punishable by fine to “teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.”\n\n“The American Civil Liberties Union, which was then just a baby organization, got wind of (the law) and decided this was a fight they wanted to pick,” said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education and leading advocate for secular science education. “So they sent letters to Tennessee newspapers saying that they were looking for a teacher who would be willing to be a defendant in the test case of the Butler Act.\n\nIn Dayton, Tennessee, George Rappleyea, a local businessman, saw the ads and hatched a plan.\n\nHe convinced the young John Scopes, a Dayton biology teacher and football coach, to be the test case.\n\nScopes was a rather willing participant. He was a University of Kentucky graduate and had watched his professors rally to defeat a similar bill that had gone before Kentucky legislators in 1922.\n\nAfter Rappleyea arranged to have Scopes arrested for admitting to teaching evolution — something he likely never actually did, according to numerous historians — William Jennings Bryan, a staunch Christian anti-evolutionist, former U.S. House member, secretary of state under President Woodrow Wilson and a three-time Democratic presidential candidate, agreed to serve as the prosecutor.\n\nClarence Darrow, who was an avowed agnostic and impassioned labor lawyer, joined the ACLU in Scopes’ defense.\n\nThe trial that followed was heated. Spectators swarmed in from around the country to see the legendary lawyers battle over creationism, evolution and the role of religion in government.\n\nThe courtroom was so overcrowded at one point that town officials warned the building might collapse, prompting the judge to set up a temporary court outside to appease the masses.\n\nAudiences across the country tuned in to the trial as well, both through radio and newspaper. The trial was the first to be broadcast live on radio in American history, with Chicago's WGN Radio spending $1,000 a day — equivalent to over $18,000 a day in today's economy — to run cables from Chicago, Illinois to Dayton, Tennessee to provide live gavel-to-gavel coverage of the \"trial of the century.\"\n\nFamous journalist and commentator Henry Louis “H.L.” Mencken, who wrote for the Baltimore Sun at the time of the trial, wrote daily columns for the paper covering the ordeal and famously dubbed the proceedings as \"The Monkey Trial.”\n\nThe expansive audience placed pressure on the lawyers. After facing significant roadblocks in his defense, Darrow changed tactics and called Bryan to the stand in an attempt to prove Bryan’s literal interpretation of the Bible was unfit to base laws on.\n\n“Bryan had a lot of difficulty with (Darrow’s questions), and many of them were not very subtle or sophisticated questions,” Branch said. “One of the questions that Darrow asked was ‘Where did Cain, the second son of Adam and Eve, find his wife?’ And Bryan had no kind of answer for this. He said ‘I leave the atheist to look for her.’”\n\nThe grueling examination left Bryan scrambling and humiliated.\n\n“Darrow was quite relentless, and in many people's opinion, especially the big city reporters, Bryan came across not only as ignorant, but as complacent about his ignorance,” Branch said.\n\nIn Darrow’s closing arguments, he asked the jury to return a guilty verdict so he could try the case on appeal — where he would have more room to argue the law itself was unconstitutional. And in a clever legal maneuver, Darrow denied Bryan the chance to give his own closing argument that he had been anticipating for weeks.\n\nAfter only nine minutes of deliberation, the jury returned the desired guilty verdict. And while Scopes got away with paying a $100 fine, about $1,800 in today's dollars, Bryan left the court disgraced. He died just five days later on a Sunday afternoon − in Dayton.\n\nDarrow’s plan worked. At least in the end. In 1927, the Tennessee Supreme Court overturned the Scopes trial verdict on a technicality, though it did not touch the law itself.\n\nThen in 1967, another lawsuit by a Tennessee teacher finally led state lawmakers to repeal the Butler Act.\n\nOne year later, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar anti-evolution Arkansas law on the basis that it violated the establishment clause in the First Amendment, forever stamping anti-evolution laws in the country as unconstitutional.\n\nThe Scopes trial put the town of Dayton, Tennessee on the map and thrust the separation of church and state to the forefront. A century later, the nation is still debating similar issues with cases again going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“I've always looked at the Scopes trial as an early skirmish in the public school-based culture wars that became so prominent in the decades that followed,” said Rob Boston, senior adviser at Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. “It was like a robin in spring. You see the robin in your yard, and you know that spring is on the way — a harbinger for things to come.”\n\nAt a speech during a centennial celebration dinner in Dayton, Tennessee in March, Larson spoke about a conversation he had with a professor at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.\n\n\"He told me that (when he thinks) about it, he can't help but compare the Scopes trial to the laws and policies of today that attempt to regulate controversial topics, like education, gender rights, book bans in schools, etc.,\" Larson said. \"So many issues still boil down to science versus culture.\"\n\n\"The Scopes trial shows us that criminal justice is not just about enforcing laws, but also about negotiating societal values within a legal framework.\"\n\nIn Tennessee, conservative lawmakers never stopped pushing legislation to strengthen certain Christian values in classrooms: from recent laws restricting access to books deemed immoral and requirements to teach anti-abortion materials supported by faith-based groups to laws attempting to allow the placement of the Ten Commandments in public schools and the hiring of grade-school chaplains.\n\nIn Texas, recent state curriculum has brought pushback for its inclusion of Genesis and creation-focused lessons for K-5 students.\n\nIn West Virginia, lawmakers passed a bill in 2024 that allowed school teachers to discuss “theories of how the universe and\/or life came to exist,” in a move many critics say was a thinly veiled attempt to allow creationism into public schools.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the state Supreme Court blocked an attempt by the Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters and the Oklahoma State Department of Education in March to spend tax dollars on Bibles and biblical curriculum in public schools.\n\nIn a news release from the Oklahoma State Department of Educationoriginally announcing the intent to buy the Bibles in December 2024, Walters defended the decision as the best way to educate children on the nation's history.\n\n\"Oklahoma is putting the Bible and the historical impact of Christianity back in school,\" Walter said. \"We are demanding that our children learn the full and true context of our nation’s founding and of the principles that made and continue to make America great and exceptional.\"\n\nThen just in June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of Maryland parents had a right to opt their children out of public school instruction that included LGBTQ+ themes, citing the parents’ First Amendment right to free exercise of religion.\n\nIn the end, Larson said that even 100 years later, Americans can relate to what took place in Dayton.\n\n“To me, if you ask me what the trial is: I think it is a ripping good story involving people who are larger than life, but featuring people and issues you can relate too,\" Larson said.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network - Tennessee's coverage of First Amendment issues is funded through a collaboration between the Freedom Forum and Journalism Funding Partners.\n\nHave a story to tell?

    "News_title":"Democrats Are at a Historic Low Point. A Certain Kind of Advice Brought Them Here—and They Can’t Stop Listening to It.",
    "News_text":"A few months ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was holding a press conference with an almond farmer when reporters asked him about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the immigrant living in Maryland whom the Trump administrationhad accusedof being an MS-13 gang member. The Department of Homeland Security had recently deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison because of an administrative error—and was refusing to rectify it, despitemultiple court orders.\n\nGiven the chance to address Donald Trump’s suspension of due process and defiance of the judiciary, Newsom—a would-be leader of the national opposition—called the case a “distraction” from the president’s tariff policies. Despite growing public outrage, he wanted to stick to prepared remarks about almond exports.\n\nThis was the same man who once guaranteed “sanctuary for all who seek it” within California’s borders and who, more recently, had said he wanted toremake what the Democratic Party stands for. He practically oozes the aspiration to become its presidential nominee in 2028.\n\nBut that April day, the governor of the country’s largest nominal stronghold of liberalism insinuated that the White House was pleased—in a calculated sort of way—that elected Democrats were drawing attention to Abrego Garcia rather than the losses being suffered by the S&P 500. “They don’t want to be accountable to markets today,” Newsom said. Then, referring to the farmer, Christine Gemperle, with whom he was holding a press conference abouta lawsuit he had filed over the tariffs: “They don’t want to have a real conversation with Christine, and what’s going on with the export uncertainty here in the Valley.”\n\nThe Gettysburg Address it wasn’t. (Shouldthe Gettysburg Address have been more concerned with kitchen-table issues?) But it provided a candid glimpse into how many of the Democratic Party’s most important figures think. It was an acute case of Strategist Brain, you might call it, and a vivid example of how deep a hole the United States is in. (Newsom was not exactly wrong that the president’s unilateraland possibly illegalimposition of economy-crippling tariffs was also deserving of attention.) Yet while the story of how campaign strategists gained such a hold on the party explains a lot about its present impotence, it could also suggest a path back to both electoral success and actual working governance.\n\nDemocratic politicians—including presidents—come and go. But the party’s strategists endure, as does the kind of strategy they typically recommend. In the early 1990s, the most celebrated Democratic minds were Bill Clinton–affiliated operatives and pollsters like James Carville, Mark Penn, and Al From—advocates of pragmatic, fiscally moderate economic positions and bold breaks from progressive orthodoxy on cultural issues. They remain influential: Carville has a regular column in the New York Times; the newspaper recentlypublished an interviewwith From and three fellow ’92 campaign veterans about what Democrats should do heading into the midterms. The illustration that ran with the article featured a photo of Hillary Clinton, who had hired Penn as her top 2008 campaign strategist.\n\nThere are newer gurus in elite party circles too—figures like onetime Barack Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, pollster and onetime Obama campaign staffer David Shor, and blogger Matt Yglesias—who are more proficient with new jargon and technology but give essentially the same advice: Follow the polls, talk about middle-class economic concerns, and occasionally make it clear that you’re not one ofthoseliberals by taking a few contrarian, conservative positions on social or cultural issues.\n\nWhy have Democrats been taking advice from the same small circle of people—who were never chosen by voters, are never accountable to them, and haven’t worked in government in decades, if ever—for more than 30 years? Why don’t these people’s ideas ever seem to change? How might this contribute to the party’s national reputation forirrelevance and ineffectiveness, not to mention the state of the American system of government (i.e., on the verge of collapse)?\n\nThe answers I’d propose are not as straightforward as you might be guessing. You’re not about to read a case for principled leftism or political courage. Those concepts have their place, but the truth is that talking about middle-class economics while moderating strategically on wedge issuesdoeswin votesin biannual congressional elections and presidential races. The problem is that too many people in the party have forgotten that they’re supposed to do anything else. And while some bright Democratic minds have overcome this handicap in the past by virtue of their own keen instincts, might there be a smarter way to run things?\n\nIn the decades since the Democratic Party got its clock cleaned in the 1984 presidential election, it has gotten really good at one thing: finding candidates who are skilled fundraisers and using the money they raise to carpet-bomb small slices of undecided voters with poll-tested and focus-grouped ads that appeal to their vaguely moderate views on a handful of nationally resonant issues. In the present day, when losing control of the House can mean “There aren’t goingto be vaccinesor weather forecastsanymore,” this is high-stakes work. The people who carry it out are campaign strategists, and it makes sense they would feel owed a measure of gratitude and prominence.\n\nBut there was a time in the United States, as hard as it might be to imagine, when there were no celebrity political strategists. Candidates decided how to campaign, and people who worked for political parties decided what policies to pursue. Parties gauged voters’ responses thereto in a variety of ways, including interactions between voters and local party organizers. All of these people had their own selfish ambitions, but they had incentives nonetheless to think about the practical, long-term consequences of the decisions they made.\n\nThis was the era of strong parties, also known as political machines. And they had downsides: They could be corrupt, and they did not make decisions in a democratic way. In response, reformers pushed to limit the power they possessed, a lengthy effort that began during the Progressive Era of the early 20thcentury and culminated after the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. At that gathering, held during the Vietnam War, party leaders, including infamous machine Mayor Richard Daley, strong-armed through a pro-war platform as protesters were beaten in the streets outside. In its aftermath, Democrats adopted so-calledbinding primaries, in which voters, rather than party officials, selected candidates.\n\nAs party organizations lost their control over the way elections were conducted and funded, their power waned and their size dwindled. They became, in the titular words ofa 2024 bookby political scientists Daniel Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld, hollow parties.\n\nAnd although the procedural changes that killed off party machines were supposed to put engaged, informed citizens back in charge of their government, that’s not what happened. The decline of party power coincided with the rise of suburbs and television, which contributed to a broader decline in civic participation. Just asbowling leaguesand Kiwanis clubs suffered, so too did local party activity:In Pew’s surveys, the share of Americans who call themselves Democrats has fallen from a high of 51 percent in 1964 to 33 percent today. When Pew started collecting data in 1939, only 18 percent of respondents identified as independents; that number is now 35 percent.\n\nLater, the launches of Craigslist (1995) and the Google search engine (1998) began crushing local and regional newspapers. Geographic and cultural “polarization” hardened Americans’ partisan identities, which meant that fewer and fewer local and state-level elections were competitive—and that less happened in Congress once the elections were over. Democrats, hoping to escape their reputation as “the party of big government,” stopped advocating for New Deal–style big-ticket social programs and embraced so-calledsubmerged statepolicies—the kinds that are built around little-noticed tax incentives and the outsourcing of government functions to third parties. For elected Democrats, this is a time of both gridlock and caution: There is less actual governing to do than there used to be, and the governing that does get done is less tangible to voters than it once was.\n\nBut elections keep happening nevertheless. Sometimes they are largely symbolic competitions between abstract visions of what it means to be American; sometimes they are consequential referendums on whether insurance companies should be able to deny you coverage for brain cancer because you have mild asthma. Feelingsaboutand interestinelections have rarely been higher—and technology has made it possible to conduct public opinion polls, test and target messages, and sort demographic data on a massive scale.\n\nFor campaign strategists, in other words, this is a golden age.\n\n“It’s kind of remarkable how much consultants came out of the destruction of parties as a real organizing force in politics,” said Gregory Martin, a professor at Stanford University who studies the role of media and advertising in elections. “And how consultants have substituted for things that parties used to do.” Of the$16 billion spenton political campaigns in 2024, about half a billion went through theparty’s national organization. The lion’s share of political spending, Martin has found, flows from campaigns (or super PACs) through their consultants to media firms that book TV advertising.\n\n“The core work of what a party does—determining what the message is, what does the party stand for, what policies does it pursue, what are the public rationales it offers—all those things have been outsourced,” Martin said. There is still a party machine, of sorts, in that Democratic decisionmaking is disproportionately controlled by a certain group of powerful individuals, like the ones who were accused ofputting their thumb on the scalefor Hillary Clinton in 2016 andhelping cover upJoe Biden’s decline in 2024. But now those figures are part of a “blob” (that’s anotherHollow Partiesterm) of consultants and fundraisers clustered on the coasts who have neither formal obligations to nor channels of communication with the vast majority of Democratic voters.\n\nConsultants, in other words, have different interests than formal parties do. Their incentive is to find work every two years, then to receive and spend as much money as possible while employed. And they have an incentive to work for the campaigns that are most likely to win, because that helps them get their next job. “We showed that the consultants that are the most high reputation, the ones who command the highest rates and had the best track records, work mostly for safe incumbents,” Martin told me. “Which is the opposite of what you would get if the party was trying to allocate a resource and maximize for its own goals. There’s a lot of very safe incumbents spending a lot of money hiring high-profile, prestigious consultants to run their campaigns. And there’s a lot of uncompetitive races where candidates are running TV ads, which are very expensive and which happen to generate profits for consultants.”\n\nThis also means that strategy consulting is the best way to build a stable, well-compensated career in government. “If you want to do well in politics, you can make a lot more money in a consulting firm than working on a campaign or on a staff,” Martin said. (In a recent appearance on Ezra Klein’sNew York Times podcast, former Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez aide Saikat Chakrabarti described arriving in Congress and being invited to a seminar about how to get policy ideas from lobbyists—the implication being that congressional staffs are too small to do the work themselves.)\n\nBut reality encompasses long stretches of time between elections, during which conditions are shaped by factors besides reactions tomessage tests. Public opinion changes; opposing parties do things; “exogenous shocks” like pandemics and wars and market crashes occur. The party and its blob are finely tuned for outputting effective language about working across the aisle and protecting Social Security. They have proved much less adept at weighing competing short-term and long-term interests while responding to real-world events, protecting the party’s reputation and advancing its overall plan for improving the United States. There is no one left, really, whose job is to do that.\n\nIn 2002, asThe Hollow Partiesrecounts, party leaders told Democrats at a “messaging retreat” that polling called for enthusiastic support of George W. Bush’s foreign policy. But as Hillary Clinton learned when her vote to authorize the Iraq war cost her the Democratic nomination in 2008, there is no reason to assume a correlation between a policy thattestswell and one thatworkswell. And even in an era of siloed information diets, reality does occasionally leak through to the electorate, even if it sometimes takes longer than one news cycle.\n\nDemocrats have long cultivated a penny-wise and pound-foolish relationship with public opinion data. For decades, the party’s presidents have gotten “tough” on the southern border by closing this or that loophole and ordering increased deportations—toughness polls well—without addressing the underlying situation:Roughly 700 immigration judgesare somehow supposed to handle literallymillions of asylumclaims each yearwhile the available legal pathways to citizenship remainnarrow and convoluted. The border tends to stay chaotic, an issue for which voters blame Democrats.\n\nIn 2009 Democrats who wanted to project moderation and responsibilitykilled off major parts of Obama’s stimulus bill, which then failed to adequately stimulate the economy, leading (in part) to many ofthose members’ defeatsin the 2010 midterms. (Obama’s advisers also counseled him against bailing out the auto industry—it polled poorly in Michigan—but he did it anyway, and it ended up being considered one of the keys to his 2012 reelection.) The same process repeated itself during Biden’s term, when centrist Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin vetoed the portions of the Build Back Better bill that would have benefited voters with young children and seniors who required in-home health care. The party settled instead for long-term investments in semiconductor manufacturing and green tech; those may be worthy initiatives, but polls showed that voters never ended up hearing about them.\n\nNot all of the party’s elected officials act this way. The most important thing about working with a campaign strategist, a political operative I know told me recently, might be figuring out when to ignore your campaign strategist. Jay Inslee, now 74 and still doingclimate change activism, served three terms as the governor of Washington and was elected to Congress eight times. During his career, he had a habit of staking out decisive positions that eventually became party consensus. In 1998 he won a swing district by making the risky decision to turn the race into a referendum on the Republican impeachment of Bill Clinton. (Inslee argued that it had been awaste of time.) In 2017 he was among the first to protest Trump’s “Muslim ban.”\n\nWhen I spoke to him, he didn’t seem to think there was much of a trick to it. “I’ve made some decisions just based on my gut,” he said, “feelings about what I believe America is about. When I heard about the Muslim ban, I literally turned the car around and drove to SeaTac Airport. You just can’t resist your impulse to stand up for basic American values, what you think the nation is about.\n\n“I think there is also probably a spectrum of how much people are willing to tolerate risk,” he said. “And I think, on that spectrum, I’m also a person who has been willing to look at the longer term, to be confident in my ability to win the respect of my constituents—maybe not their agreement, but their respect.”\n\nInslee is not, he told me, against staying abreast of public opinion per se. “I think polling can be of assistance to any public official to say, ‘Look, you said X, but they heard Y, right?’ The language you’re using, making sure that you’re really communicating.” His style of data collection, though, is often more art than science. “I’m out talking to people and listening to them where they live. I’m in schools, listening to teachers and parents, I’m in homeless camps, listening to people. The office is not the place where you’re going to be able to read people’s feelings.”\n\nThe strategy guys who work out of fancy offices tend to have staying power, though, no matter how poor their advice on subjects other than campaigns turns out to be. Rahm Emanuel, for instance, ended his tenure as mayor of Chicago with an18 percent approval ratingand is nowconsidering a run for president.\n\nFor this, the blame might extend beyond the world of politics. The U.S. is a country that rewards the clever, scalable, levered shortcut. Private equity, hedge funds, venture capital: For ambitious and high-functioning individuals, making morally disinterested, data-driven strategic decisions is the most obvious path to wealth and status.\n\nIt’s not uncommon, either, for those with this vocation to switch back and forth between finance and politics. (Consider how absurd it would seem today if a modern president spent his post–White House life, like Jimmy Carter did, helping build houses for poor families by hand—an intrinsically unscalable activity and a disastrously inefficient deployment of Carter’s human capital.) In addition to Emanuel, a part-timeinvestment banker, a list of the most influential Democrats of the 21stcentury would also includehedge fund managing partner\/economic policy guru Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder, VC investor, and megadonorReid Hoffman. (Sam Bankman-Fried wason his waytoo.)\n\nBut the shortsightedness of the campaign strategist’s approach to governing parallels the financial industry’s fixation on short-term results—a fixation that often creates long-term problems that end up erasing whatever gains were made in the first place.\n\nIn a new book calledThe Unaccountability Machine, author Dan Davies describes how companies like Wells Fargo and Boeing raised their earnings by, respectively, incentivizing low-level employees toopen as many accounts as possible on “behalf” of customersandoutsourcing major parts of the manufacturing process. Those decisions led directly to huge scandals andbig losses. “It’s really easy for an organization to fool itself, like Wells Fargo, that what it’s doing is really clever, it’s increasing revenue per customer,” said Davies on theComplex Systemspodcastto host and tech-world figurePatrick McKenzie, “when what it’s actually doing is building up a huge operational risk liability for itself five or 10 years down the line.” Every individual decision to cut costs is supported by data: This will increase earnings, which will make the stock go up, which is what companies are supposed to do, according to the theory of maximizing shareholder value. But the wrong series of individually justifiable “good” decisions can function as one very bigbaddecision.\n\nTo understand how this happens in politics, consider the kind of research conducted by David Shor, the former Obama staffer whose data research and ideas about “popularism” and (surprise!) breaking from orthodoxy on cultural issues have made him a favorite of Democratic electeds. In 2024, for instance, Shor’s firm Blue Rose Research conducted a survey of more than 9,000 voters who were given a range of rhetoric about the Kamala Harris campaign to evaluate. It found, for example, that saying “You may not always agree with me” and using the wordsgrow,both,economists, andmilitarytested well. The notion of lifting up and fighting for the middle class by working “across party lines” and with “leaders in both parties” also polled favorably. (The messages that tested worst involved former allies of Trump’s describing him as a threat to democracy.)\n\nThe survey is not ideologically biased—“taking on price gouging,” for example, is an idea more associated with the Democratic left than with the center. And you can see why it has appeal: It’s science, and it tells youexactly what to do. If you do what it says but still lose, hey, you did your best.\n\nStill, this memo conveys only one type of data: how voters respond to a discrete set of messages after agreeing to take part in a survey for someone putting together a memo. There is a lot that’snotdiscussed in a document like this. For one, it can’t predict the cumulative effect of everyone in the Democratic Party using the same sanded-down phrases about “fighting for your family.” This, as Stanford’s Martin pointed out to me, is a classic tragedy of the commons, and it has caused a crisis in Democratic fundraising too: The party’s dominant mode of faux-personal email and text outreach might be empirically effective when used by one candidate, but not when used byallcandidates, and its donors are gettingfedup. Democrats, though they’ve done well to adapt their ’92-era messaging ideas tocontemporary technology, still struggle with the “social” part of social media. (No one was making time at the watercooler to talk about Harris’ “opportunity economy.” Trump went viral on TikTok for economic promises hedidn’t even make.)\n\nMessage testing can’t tell you how to handle contradictory or volatile voter beliefs—the public tends to say it supports both increased government spending and smaller government, for instance, and has shifted its position on whether there should be more or less immigration10 times in the past 10 years. It can’t tell you, in the event that you enact a useful policy, how to make sure voters notice its effects and associate them with Democrats; conversely, it doesn’t tell you anything about the potential consequences of winning office andfailingto follow through on something that you claimed, during your campaign, to support. Shor’s tests regularly find support for unambiguously liberal messages abouttaking on corporate special interestsand raising taxes on the wealthy, but when Democrats actually hold power, this commitment somehow always ends up getting stuck to the bottom of the desk drawer.\n\nAnd what about the messages that never get tested because no one has the gumption and ambition to propose them? To run on protecting Social Security and Medicare, after all, Democrats initially had to invent Social Security and Medicare—and they had to do itwithouthaving yet paid someone to run the numbers on whether voters would approve of protecting these programs. The closest the party has come to creating a new pillar of popular support in the past 30 years was passing the Affordable Care Act’s protection against denying insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting medical issues. At the time,Emanuel reportedly advisedBarack Obama to abandon the ACA push in favor of smaller agenda items that would have been easier to build bipartisan consensus around.\n\nFinally, let’s say that for years you’ve ignored subjects, like theconfirmation of judges, that are statistically of little interest to low-engagement sections of the electorate. What if a Democratic policy that tests really well is frozen by an injunction issued by one of the right-wing activists that Republican presidents have, as a result, stuffed into the federal judiciary at disproportionate rates? And what happens to your campaign’s chances if you’ve let the opposition change the rules of elections in their favor so often that it’s not out of the question that they might decide to shut down elections for good?\n\nTrying to solve every problem by figuring out the right way to talk about it is an approach with limitations that probably should be obvious. Elected Democrats and the donors that keep the party running are, nonetheless, quite captivated by it. Newly elected Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego, for instance, invited Matt Yglesias—the “issue salience” guru whose writing wassaid to be widely circulatedin the Biden administration—to a $5,000-a-head donor retreat he held in March at something called the L’Auberge de Sedona resort. (Yglesiastold Rolling Stonehe was not accepting a fee to speak at the event.) Sometimes, like in the case of Newsom and the almond farmer, the elected officials appear to have become confused about when they are supposed to be running the country and when they are supposed to be positioning themselves for their next 30-second advertisement. The costs can be significant.\n\nLet’s imagine that Newsom had turned out to be right that the Abrego Garcia case was a loser for Democrats.He wasn’t—and, since then, he seems to have sharpened his thinking ontaking a stand againstimmigration-related executive overreach—but just imagine. What if Democratshadstopped talking about Abrego Garcia and strategically backed away from supporting litigation in his case (and other similar cases)? Perhaps by refocusing the news cycle on the consequences of tariffs, they might have been able to knock 1 or 2 percent off Trump’s approval rating. What else might have happened?\n\nPicture it: In the absence of controversy, voters begin to perceive extrajudicial, permanent deportations as unobjectionable, routine, and effective. (It’s not uncommon for a wide majority of voters to initially agree that a given news event constitutes a major scandal, only to drift toward a 50–50 partisan split on the issue over time. There’s a very big example of this, in fact, that we’ll get to shortly.) Judges take the retreat as a signal that the Democratic Party doesn’t support their independence and authority. So do other civil society institutions that are under attack, like universities and law firms, who cut deals with the administration rather than confronting them in court. It’s a vicious circle of rats abandoning ship. Is it worth 1 or 2 points in the polls 18 months before an election? Particularly whenDemocratsthemselvesare on the list of future targets for harassment? There is afamous poem about thisthat, in its way, is about long-term strategy!\n\nIn similar fashion, Yglesias recently suggested that Episcopal Church volunteers should help the Trump administration resettle white South Africans—who are being flown to the U.S. at the behest of the executive branch’s many racial science conspiracy theorists while other refugees are denied entry indefinitely—in order toavoid raising the salience of immigration as a national issue.\n\nBut if you play dead for an entire presidential term while everyone in the U.S. who isn’t considered sufficiently white gets thrown into the back of a van, can you simply flip a switch to transform the country back into the world’s model of liberal democracy and cosmopolitan prosperity? Bear in mind,if the pastis any guide, Democratic candidates will say in 2026 and 2028 that they need to win legislative majorities in order todefend constitutional government. That’s a goal so important, apparently, that no tactic is off the table in its service—even choosing not to defend constitutional government. What, as they say, are we doing here?\n\nAs polling writer G. Elliott Morrisrecently pointed out, the truly savvy politician stakes out positions that align with public opinionbefore voters get there, which is what Inslee did with impeachment and what Obama, but not Hillary Clinton, did with Iraq. (Inslee actuallyalso did it with Iraq.) Morris illustrates nicely, with doodle-y hand-drawn arrows, why Democrats interested in pandering to the 2028 presidential electorate should be thinking about the entire potential range of beliefs the public might hold on a given issuethen, not the isolated number that describes the belief it holdsnow.\n\n“The more you think long term, maybe you make some better decisions,” Inslee said. On immigration enforcement in particular, he said, “Trump has found some short-term ways it might be to his benefit, but as more and more soccer coaches and people in churches and people who work in retirement homes are shackled, you know, by masked officials and taken out of their communities, it’s not going to look so good, right?” The Democratscurrentlyin Congress arenot so sure.\n\nThis extends beyond matters of policy into what you might call the tilt of the playing field: Democrats recently lost voting leverage in the House of Representatives, for instance, because three elderly incumbents ran for reelection after being diagnosed with cancer, then won and died of cancer. Someone probably should have stopped them from doing that. During Biden’s term, the party failed to pass a bill protecting the vote-counting process and forbidding partisan gerrymandering because a decisive number of senators, concerned about their credentials as pragmatic moderates, felt that eliminating the filibuster to do so would be unpopular.Biden reportedly appointedcentrist ex–Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland as attorney general because he felt that it would make for an admirable statement about Justice Department neutrality. Garland, in turn, refrained for two entire years from investigating Donald Trump’s role in Jan. 6 because he was allegedlyworried about appearances.\n\nAppearances and “optics” come up a lot in reporting about how Biden and Garland approached Jan. 6—much more so than questions about what kind of person should serve as the chief national law enforcement officer in the wake of an insurrection, or what approach to the leader of the insurrection would best serve the interests of national stability. Biden and Garland, in other words, both approached their jobs as if they were strategists rather than public officials. So did Nancy Pelosi, on the night of Jan. 6 itself, when she reportedly shut down animmediate effort to impeach Trumpbecause she thought that a slower, bipartisan effort would appear more responsible. In the end, with no Democrat having been willing to take one for the team to get the job done, the Supreme Court—stocked with partisan right-wing justices because the Republican Party had defied public polling and done some hardheaded realism with its seats—stepped in to issue a ruling about presidential immunity that foreclosed the possibility that Trump, whose favorability had gradually returned to its previous level as Jan. 6 faded from mind, would face trial before the election.\n\nIncredibly, this all led to Vice President Kamala Harris—the second-highest-ranking member of the team that had failed, in four years, to prosecute the person who’d tried to overturn the previous presidential election on live television—making a quote-unquote “closing argument” to voters about protecting democracy, at thesite of Trump’s Jan. 6 rally. Vote for Democrats, she said, and they would do a thing or two about standing up for the rule of law. Maybe it tested well?\n\nA number of earnest ideas have been proposed for what Democrats could spend time and money on, besides the usual, to improve their reputation and long-term outlook. Some of those include rebuilding local news, organizing local chapters around service projects or social events, and supporting the growth of labor unions. In Nevada, the late Sen. Harry Reid put time and money into drastically expanding the on-the-ground presence of his state’s Democratic Party organization, creatingnotable turnout advantages. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezhas touted“deep canvassing,” which is just a gross way of sayingtalking to regular people even when there’s not an election coming up. Some political scientiststhink there’s evidencethat it can work to change minds—and the amount of shoe leather that Zohran Mamdani and his volunteers expended seems to have contributed to hissurprise victory in the New York City mayoral primary.\n\nA lot of these ideas are, in a way, the same idea: to raise the likelihood that someone encounters a Democrat in real life, while going about their day-to-day business as a human with friends, neighbors, and a family. As Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy put it in arecent interviewwith the Atlantic, the party needs to address the “spiritual crisis” of social isolation that has driven Americans toward right-wing politicians and influencers, except without the right-wing stuff.\n\nRight now, though, it’s all just talk. Actually doing it would require, well, a Jimmy Carter kind of commitment to building one house at a time. “I think we can all name the politicians who are hungriest and thinking the most about this,” said Daniel Schlozman, one of the co-authors ofThe Hollow Parties, when I called to ask him about the Democrats’ future. “And what I would say is, to all of them, ‘What are you doing?’ That is: ‘Are you thinking about getting organizations up, or are you doing it?’ My sense of Chris Murphy ishehas some sense that people should be making more connections,” he said. “But it’s not that he’s going around Connecticut and saying, ‘We’re having a Murphy Picnic on Sunday.’ It’s that he’s going on podcasts and talking about theideaof the picnic.” (In fairness, Murphy’s staff points out that in addition to working onnational organizing efforts, he just spentfour days walking across his state meeting peopleand is helping put together asummer basketball league in Hartford.)\n\nMurphy critiques the center of the party from its left. On the flip side, there is moderate Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who recently sat fora long interview with the New York Timesabout the urgency of creating a new and presumably centrist Democratic “economic vision” in which she didn’t name a single specific idea for what such a vision would actually entail. It’spositioning-induced paralysis—being very clear on how you want to be perceived but not on what you need to do to get there.\n\nAs embarrassing as it sounds, to move forward, Democrats may need to look into their own hearts. “As far as shaping where I was from a policy standpoint, I didn’t find looking at polls terribly effective, because at least when I’ve run for public offices, it’s to try to make a difference, and that’s why I was doing it,” Inslee said. “If you don’t want to make a difference, why are you running? Let some other schmuck do it.” He also, for the record, feels that my take is a bit too cynical. “I think people would actually be surprised there’s more decisions made in Congress on what people believe is in the public interest than in venal self-interest,” he told me. “Many of those decisions are wrong. But!”\n\nIn the meantime, money continues to flow to consultants and strategists. TheTimes reportedthat a number of donors and operatives are putting together projects, some with anticipated budgets in the tens of millions of dollars, to fund and amplify influencers and podcasters—a belated top-down effort to adjust to the ways the national “narrative” is now created. (One of the people quoted in the article works for a super PAC, founded by Sam Bankman-Fried’s mother, that Bankman-Friedallegedly used to circumvent campaign-finance laws.) On June 3,Politico reportedthat a well-connected operative named Adam Jentleson will be launching a “messaging hub” called Searchlight, which will advocate for the adoption of “popular positions.” Noted a perceptive anonymous source: “We already have a bunch of entities who do that.”\n\nIronically, what the party could probably use most is a version of Trump who works for good rather than evil: someone who is attentive to the public mood but has a permanent and easily communicated agenda, who gets people off their butts at the state and local level, and who uses leverage to enforce the advancement of long-term goals even when it is not in the immediate interest of their personal “optics.” (This could also be agroupof people, in the strong-party tradition.)\n\nWhat it might not need is more public opinion data and advice about how to find the sweet spot in the middle of it. If Democrats took a five-year sabbatical from polling and message testing, how much insight would the world really be deprived of? Everyone knows what polls say: Kitchen-table issues are good for Democrats, surges in crime and undocumented immigration are bad for Democrats, gender\/race stuff is in the middle depending on what’s in the news, and it is always important to work across the aisle. One thing that seems to be forgotten by thecrusading centristsciting current polls to decry the party’s 2018–20 leftward shift on race, immigration, and sexual identity issues, in fact, is that the polls were alsoshifting leftward at the time.In 2017only one-fifth of the country believed that gender transitions constituted a “mental illness,” while the majority of Americans said that the country should do more to protect transgender rights and that they would welcome and support a friend who “came out” as trans. Picking a lane and sticking to it is the kind of thing that can prevent exuberant leftist excess too.\n\nPublic opinion can be fluid; a party that wants to succeed in the long term—and especially one that bears the burden, in a two-party system, of maintaining a functional country—needs to have priorities besides winning the next election. With these truths in mind, Democrats have a choice. They could put their heads together to make an educated guess about what the country might look like, think like, and need out of its government in 2028, then conduct themselves accordingly for the next three years. Or they could spend several hundred million dollars to find out again that the middle class likes the phrase “lift up the middle class.” Which do you think they’re more likely to choose?",

    "News_title":"Texas Flood Donations Are Becoming a Culture-War Casualty",
    "News_text":"“No! They voted for this to happen,” a donor wrote in response to our call to give cash relief to Texas flood survivors.\n\nNormally, my organizationGiveDirectlyreceives donations, not anger, when we respond to disasters. But this week, after at least 120 people, many of them children, died in theTexas floods, we’ve been inundated with messages implying that thevictimshad brought this on themselves by helping elect Donald Trump and that the politics of the state should dictate the response.\n\n“Future Trump voters. Oh well.” “Go ask Elon for help.” “Are you Texans feeling that you voted for the right man?” A longtime donor said our Texas response has “shattered” their image of our work.\n\nThis hasplayed outon social platforms as well, prompting some liberal commentators tospeak outagainst the dehumanization of Texas communities. Political trolling online is nothing new, but its spillover into blaming victims and survivors of disaster is a dangerous new low.\n\nRead More:I'm a Climate Scientist. Here's What the Floods Tell Us\n\nOur support for low-income families impacted byJanuary’s L.A. wildfiresreceived a positive response. There were no bitter comments blaming liberal forest-management policies. We simply offered aid, and people gave generously.\n\nThe contrast with Texas is disturbing. Yesterday we had to stop promoting ouronline adsas the comments below a photo of a Kerr County flood survivor filled up with sentiments of “they deserved it” and “thoughts and prayers — well, not really.”\n\nAs Nina Turner, a former national co-chair for Bernie Sanders,repliedto a now-deleted viral post blaming the Texas victims for their own suffering: “It takes a serious lack of humanity to see children die in a natural disaster and respond with something along the lines of ‘that’s what they voted for.’”\n\nAid organizations are nonpartisan so we hesitate to weigh in given the current political climate. But as we are in the business of helping people, we have to speak out against a troubling trend: American disaster relief is being politicized, and with it, our shared humanity is at risk.\n\nWe saw the effects of this polarization from the other side whenrespondingtoHurricane Helenein North Carolina last year. Some survivors refused federal aid, fearing that FEMA agents were part of a political conspiracy. In one county, responderspausedoperations after reports of an armed militia “hunting FEMA” turned out to be credible enough that responders had to evacuate.\n\nIt’s fair to disagree with policy decisions and believe those decisions leave communities exposed. The Trump Administration slashedFEMAandUSAID, and disaster declarations are increasingly wielded as political tools.\n\nBut you can hold that truth and still feel empathy for the families who lost everything. Anger at a broken system should never cancel out compassion for the people caught in its collapse.\n\nIn fact, the cracks in that system are why nonprofits like ours now play an outsize role in disaster response. FEMA itself hassaidit can’t act alone, relying on local groups, volunteers, and mutual aid to reach those in need. Our response as citizens cannot mirror the dysfunction at the top. It cannot become, “I only help those who voted like me.”\n\nWe should all be alarmed if liberals donate to only blue-state relief and conservatives support only red-state relief. Such behavior is deeply corrosive. It suggests that our compassion is conditional. That our help is earned only by ideological alignment. It’s a slippery slope, and one that undermines both disaster recovery and the social fabric it depends on.\n\nTo those wondering if Texans, who Trump quicklypromisedwould receive federal aid, should receive donations at all: nonprofits like ours help reach those missed by or awaiting FEMA’s cash aid that will take a month or more to reach them. This week, we’re paying impacted families already on food stamps, living paycheck to paycheck. Many had no flood insurance. Some have no permanent home now so they may be missed by government aid.

    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nThis is an edition ofThe AtlanticDaily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nJapan is the one place in the world that has felt, and personally mourned, the staggering damage of nuclear warfare. The tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have turned the country into a longtime proponent of nuclear disarmament. But that national identity is starting to shift. “A dangerous proliferation cascade may be about to break out, right in the shadow of Hiroshima,” my colleague Ross Andersen writes in his Augustmagazine feature. “It would likely start in South Korea, and spread first to Japan. It might not stop there. The decades-long effort to keep nuclear weapons from spreading across the planet may be about to collapse.”\n\nI spoke with Ross about what he saw in Hiroshima, how the rest of the world views President Donald Trump’s approach to global negotiation, and what it would take for the risk of nuclear war to stop feeling abstract.\n\nIsabel Fattal:Even though I knew that only one country on Earth has actually lived with the tragedies of nuclear war, your story clarified that point for me in a new way. What surprised you most about the way the 1945 atomic bombing is still felt and remembered in Hiroshima?\n\nRoss Andersen:One interesting thing about Hiroshima is that the city has been totally rebuilt. Through one lens, it’s an ordinary modern city where you can duck into a sushi restaurant on a random block and not know that you are in a place where this really terrible thing has happened. But then there’s the Peace Memorial Park, a kind of open-air museum where you can dwell on the reality of nuclear war.\n\nFor the story, I spent some time with the governor of Hiroshima, Hidehiko Yuzaki, and he told me that nearly everyone who goes sees something that hits them particularly hard. For me, it was seeing the burned clothes of very small children in the museum and thinking about what happened to them and also what happened to 20,000 other children. The enormity of that suffering is hard to even hold in your mind. But in light of that, what’s remarkable—and what surprised me—is that among the city’s leaders, there isn’t a sense of bitterness over what happened there. Instead, going all the way back to just a few years after the attacks, when the wounds were still raw, they sought to make Hiroshima a mecca for global disarmament and peace.\n\nIsabel:How does that attitude play a role in Japan’s longtime refusal to participate in a nuclear-armed world? And how is that national opinion starting to shift now?\n\nRoss:In Japan, there’s been this taboo on nuclear weapons. But you also have, speaking of historical memory, this long-standing antagonism between South Korea and Japan, and that plays out in an interesting way.\n\nThe Japanese are already on edge about their neighbors having nukes. Right in their backyard, China is engaged in the fastest nuclear buildup since the peak of the Cold War. North Korea, which is a sworn enemy of Japan, is also engaged in this nuclear buildup. So Japan and South Korea have these similar nuclear-security concerns, but what’s so ironic is that it’s South Korea getting nuclear weapons that would really tip Japan over, at least based on what I heard from people on the ground there. They just could not abide a world in which South Korea had nuclear weapons and they did not. And so clearly, even though we’re a couple generations removed from Japan’s brutal colonization of South Korea, that history is alive today.\n\nIsabel:One subtheme of your article is how U.S. presidents, their specific temperaments and philosophies, have shaped progress on global disarmament, or lack thereof. Did you come away with any lessons on what sort of president is best suited for making disarmament a reality?\n\nRoss:My view is that historical conditions matter more than personalities when it comes to disarmament. One thing to celebrate is that throughout U.S. presidencies, including Donald Trump’s, there’s been a remarkably bipartisan record of pushing for nonproliferation. And of course, different presidents have pursued that goal in different ways. It was interesting to hear the defense intelligentsia in South Korea weigh in on Trump’s attempts to engage Kim Jong Un at these grand summits in his first term.\n\nIt wasn’t that these South Korean strategists and defense experts were opposed to summits with North Korea on principle. They just know that Kim is a pretty wily character, so if you want to have a diplomatic breakthrough with him, you have to have a sophisticated strategy for what you’re going to accomplish. You have to have the chessboard laid out. There was a feeling that Trump wasn’t all that prepared, and that he thought doing this was like doing a real-estate deal, and that that’s why he failed.\n\nIsabel:The possibility of nuclear war feels so far away for many people. Do you think citizens will ever care on a more personal level?\n\nRoss:Itisremoved from most people’s daily lives, and of course, I hope it stays that way forever. A chilling thought I’ve had that you’re hinting at in your question is that we’d never see the abolition of these weapons, or meaningful disarmament, unless there was a major exchange that was so awful that it led to an international taboo. But you could also imagine scenarios where a major exchange made people cling to these weapons even more tightly, because it would lead to global political instability on a scale that we have not seen in the modern era.\n\nEither way, I really hope that we can get serious arms control or disarmament without something like that happening. But at the very least, it’s going to take a very different global security environment than the one we have now, where major powers are once again at one another’s throats and people are making open nuclear threats. Historically, you tend to see disarmament when people feel like a lasting peace has taken hold, like in those years immediately after the Cold War. The key is to get toward peace and then have the ideas set up in advance so that you can take advantage of those windows, because as we’ve learned, they can be brief.\n\nRelated:\n\nThe nuclear club might soon double.\n\nThe president’s weapon\n\nHere are three new stories fromThe Atlantic:\n\nTrump loves ICE.

    "News_text":"Officials revealed new details to KTLA on Thursday morning regarding the frightening tunnelcollapsein Los Angeles’ Wilmington neighborhood, which resulted in a large rescue mission to recover dozens of trapped workers on Wednesday night.\n\nIt was just before 8 p.m. Wednesday night when LAFD crews responded to the initial report of the collapse at the industrial tunnel on the 1700 block of South Figueroa Street. The tunnel was filled with workers at the time, who were located about 400 feet beneath the surface and around six miles away from the tunnel’s only access point.\n\nRonnie Villanueva, the Los Angeles City Fire Department’s interim chief, explained that the collapse happened after what’s only being described as “a structure failure,” while further details remain under investigation. “The tunnel lining failed approximately five to six miles in, trapping what we thought was 27 individuals — but four more went in to rescue — so a total of 31,” said Villanueva.\n\nOver 100 LAFD responders came to the scene to help with the tricky rescue. Some workers who were separated inside the tunnel had to climb over a 12-to-15-foot pile of loose soil to escape and join their colleagues on the other side.\n\n“Material did obstruct their exit from the tunnel,” said Michael Chee of the L.A. County Sanitation District. “But fortunately, the tunnel is 18 feet in diameter, so even though the material did come down from the top, there was enough space for them to clamber over that material, and then it was a five-mile walk or transit out of the tunnel from there.”\n\nThey were then brought up in groups of eight using a crane, and, by 9:20 p.m., all 31 of the workers were safely extricated and evaluated by paramedics. Many were seen hugging each other, and no injuries were reported.\n\n“We’re all blessed today in Los Angeles,” said Mayor Karen Bass. “No one injured, everyone is safe, and I am feeling very, very good that this is a great outcome in what started as a very scary evening.”\n\nOfficials told KTLA’s Carlos Herrera that the wastewater tunnel site is part of the L.A. County Sanitation District’s Clearwater Project, which spans seven miles, 200 feet underground — and that it’s meant to help modernize wastewater infrastructure. In addition, it’s expected to end at Royal Palms Beach in San Pedro.\n\nFor now, however, work on the $700 million project has been halted.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_title":"Trump to survey floods as he flaunts ties to deep-red Texas",
    "News_text":"President Trump is flaunting his bond with deep-red Texas ahead of a Friday trip to the state, where he will assess deadly flooding that took the lives of more than 120 people.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) has heaped praise on the administration this week for the federal response to the disaster, even as the Trump administration has made cuts to the nation’s climate and weather agencies and officials continue to push axing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThe camaraderie stands in stark contrast to the the California wildfires in January, during which Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D)played a blame game for weeksover water access, the loss of thousands of structures and a dozen deaths.\n\nCritics argue that Trump’s handling of both deadly disasters showcases how he tends to politicize such events.\n\nJeremy Edwards, a former Biden White House and FEMA spokesperson, said he suspects if the Texas flooding had occurred in a state run by a Democrat, Trump’s sentiments would be very different.\n\n“I find it very hard to imagine that if this exact situation were to happen in a blue state with a Democratic governor, he would not immediately lambast them for steps that they did or didn’t take with regards to emergency alerts,” Edwards said\n\nOther critics noted how Trump’s predecessors went to great lengths to support communities, no matter how they tended to lean politically.\n\n“What I’d seen during the Obama administration and the Biden administration is presidents working with governors, regardless of party, to support the impacted community, whether it was in Florida with Biden and Gov. [Ron] DeSantis working side by side following the Surfside building collapse, Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Milton … putting politics aside,” said Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff in the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\n“Until this administration, I really haven’t seen emergency management being politicized the way it is,” Coen added.\n\nAbbott is expected to join Trump in Texas, where he will meet with first responders, receive a briefing from local elected officials and meet with family members of those affected, according to a White House official.\n\nFor his part, Newsom also greeted Trump on the tarmac in California when he visited the state shortly after he retook office, but before the trip, the presidentthreatened to withholdfederal wildfire aid because of concerns about the state’s water management.\n\nIn Texas, some other particulars are at play.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service (NWS),cut hundreds of staffersduring a government overhaul earlier this year.\n\nAnd the warning coordination meteorologist for the NWS’s Austin-San Antonio office, who organizes the deployment of alerts about agency forecasts, took aTrump administration buyoutin April.\n\nThat has put in the spotlight some of the cuts the Trump administration has implemented, and continues to threaten.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is also expected to join Trump on the ground in Texas, this week saidFEMA should be “remade”even as the agency responded to the floods and both Noem and Trump have insisted such disaster response should be managed by states.\n\n“We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does. We come in and support them, and that’s exactly what we did here in this situation,” she said.\n\nFEMA has especially been in the GOP’s crosshairs since Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina last year, a state Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris had been vying for during the 2024 election.\n\nThe North Carolina disaster was plagued by rumors that FEMA was avoiding red-leaning areas and not helping Republican households, at times hampering the response under former President Biden.\n\nA former Bush administration Homeland Security official said Trump’s response to the Texas floods comes amid a cascade of changes in federal government operations this year.\n\n“Disaster politics are always tricky, but this tragedy is amid the backdrop of DOGE and the administration’s broader efforts to reduce the federal role in disaster response,” the former Bush official said, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n“The president and the governor get along well and are very simpatico on immigration, but these situations normally receive a level of empathy that this president does not like to display,” the former official added.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to think so. He has praised his alliance with Abbott, citing it as a factor in the unified response to the floods at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.\n\n“The relationship with Texas and the governor has been obviously very good for years, with me,” Trump said. “The response has been incredible, and the fact that we got along so well, I don’t even think that’s a political thing, but we got along so well, and it was so unified. I think a lot of lives have been saved.”\n\nBut, if the administration faces negative reviews over the response in Texas, some critics are bracing for a similar blame game Trump has leaned on in the past.\n\n“I think this is going to be the same thing he does with the economy. When the economy is bad, it’s Biden’s economy. When the economy is good, it’s Trump’s economy,” said Edwards, a senior communications adviser at the Century Foundation. “And I think, if the response and recovery goes well — and I hope it does — it’s Trump’s FEMA, but if the response goes badly, it’s Biden’s FEMA.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_title":"Georgia lags far behind other states in the number of journalists, says new report",
    "News_text":"A new local journalism report reveals a 75% decline in local journalists across the country since 2002. Photo contributed by Kevin Hall\n\nThe decline of local news continues on the national level and here at home in Georgia. A new local journalismreportfromRebuild Local NewsandMuck Rackreveals a 75% decline in local journalists across the country since 2002.\n\n“The goals of this new report and project is to try to create a measure of journalists per population and an index that could be recreated each year down to the county level,” Rebuild Local Journalism Founder Steve Waldman said during a webinar Thursday. “The reason that we all felt that that was important is that at the heart of the local news crisis is the lack of coverage and the lack of reporters in communities.”\n\nThe report, which was released Thursday, found that the shortage of local journalists is both severe and widespread. This shortage is measured by a new metric called Local Journalist Equivalents (LJEs), which uses a formula to evaluate the strength of local journalism. LJEs were determined by outlet types, verifiable bylines and reporting capacity based on factors like publishing frequency. This data was then used to show nationwide trends and state specific metrics.\n\nIn 2002, there was a national average of about 40 local journalists per 100,000 people. Today, that figure has dropped to an average of 8.2 Local Journalist Equivalents. Georgia’s average currently sits well below that number, landing Georgia at No. 46 on this year’s ranking.\n\nWith a statewide population of 11 million people, Georgia has an average of 5.8 Local Journalist Equivalents per 100,000 people. This average was significantly less than the No. 1 ranked state of Vermont that has an average of 27.5. Nevada trailed four places behind Georgia with the lowest ranked average of 4.8 local journalists.\n\nWhile the decline of local news is not a new phenomenon, the report confirms that rural areas are not the only communities underserved by local news. Many fast growing areas including Los Angeles and Las Vegas also scored below the national average.\n\nRichard T. Griffiths, a retired reporter and president emeritus of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said continued decline of local journalism goes beyond local journalists.\n\n“It’s not the industry that is the future casualty of this, it’s democracy itself,” Griffiths said. “If you have a populace that doesn’t understand what’s going on in its community because there are no reporters able to go to the meetings to figure out what’s going on, then you have a collapse of the institutions that underpin our society and our democracy.”\n\nGriffiths cited waning advertising dollars and the rise of social media as notable factors behind the demise of local news. In a world of subscriptions and paywalls, Griffiths said he believes that the business model of local journalism needs to be re-evaluated. He points to nonprofit models likeThe Currenton the Georgia coast and TheMacon Melodyas potential ways to revitalize local news.\n\nWhile the new report may not identify clear-cut solutions, the creators behind the report hope their findings can help improve the viability and sustainability of local journalism.\n\n“We think we made a real significant contribution here, and that this really gives a very meaningful picture of the sort of journalistic horsepower in counties across America and will help all of us to better understand both the crisis and how to solve it,” Waldman said.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_title":"Investigating claims Trump admin's ICE funding surpasses Russia's military budget",
    "News_text":"In the summer of 2025, a rumor spread online that lawmakers provided U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a larger budget than Russia gives its military. Although the numbers cited in these claims differed, most claimed ICE received roughly $170 or $175 billion.\n\nHowever, total funding actually allocated to ICE was roughly $75 billion through September 2029 under U.S. President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) alongside a proposed — but not yet approved — base budget for the agency of $11.29 billion for fiscal year 2026. The $170 or $175 billion number appeared to come from estimates foroverallimmigration enforcement spending under the OBBB, not just funding specifically allocated to ICE.\n\nThese posts also alleged Russia's military budget was anywhere from $126 billion to $149 billion. Reputable think tanks estimated Russia's military funding at about $149 billion U.S. dollars in 2024 and $160 billion in planned spending for 2025.\n\nThus, potential ICE spending under the Trump administration for fiscal year 2026 did not surpass an estimate for Russia's planned military spending in 2025. However, it's possible the United States' overall immigration enforcement spending from Oct. 1, 2025, to Sept. 30, 2026, could exceed Russia's planned military budget in 2025. A direct comparison was not possible because the two countries use different budgeting timelines.\n\nIn the summer of 2025, a claim spread online that American lawmakers granted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) a bigger budget than Russia provided its military.\n\nThe rumor spread on platforms likeXandFacebook; while many claims included dollar amounts for both Russia's military and ICE, those numbers differed. For example, some posts alleged ICE received$175 billionin funding; others claimed the agency received$170 billionto spend. In comparison, claims listed Russia's military budget as anywhere from$126 billionto$149 billion.\n\nThese claims appeared to use legitimate — but outdated — sources to determine Russia's military budget while also conflating ICE's funding withestimatesfor overall immigration enforcement spending under U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and budget megabill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which hesigned into lawon July 4, 2025.\n\nA direct, entirely accurate monetary comparison of the two budgets was not possible, given differences in how the United States and Russia provide budget information — as well as theunstableexchange rate between Russia's currency, the ruble, and the American dollar, at least as of this writing.\n\nHowever, potential ICE spending by Trump's administration for fiscal year 2026, which runs from Oct. 1, 2025 to Sept. 30, 2026, did not surpass reputable estimates for Russia's planned military spending in 2025. Still, it's possible that the United States' overall immigration enforcement spending in fiscal year 2026 could exceed Russia's potential military budget in 2025.\n\nSnopes previouslydeterminedthe actual amount allocated to ICE under the Big Beautiful Bill andprovided contextfor a rumor that funds allocated to ICE exceeded spending for the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nTwo major budget allocations were slated to be available to ICE for fiscal year 2026. The first was the base budget amount, known as the \"appropriations\" process. Although the presidentrequestedthese funds in May, as of this writing, the U.S. Congress had not yet approved his budget proposal. The Big Beautiful Bill, a budget \"reconciliation\" bill, was considered a supplement to the base budget.\n\nThe total proposedbase budgetfor ICE in fiscal year 2026 was $11.29 billion, according to the agency'sbudget requestdocument — an increase from $10.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 (seePage 5). According to the agency, the bulk of that amount, $10.88 billion, would need Congressional approval; the rest would come from fees, such as those imposed on travelers.\n\nIn addition to this base budget, ICE will receive another approximately $75 billion to remain available until Sept. 30, 2029, through theBig Beautiful Bill, as wepreviously reported.\n\nThere were two major provisions in the GOP bill allocating funds to ICE: the first provision, onPage 825, Section 90003, \"Detention Capacity,\" sent $45 billion to ICE specifically for immigration detention centers (emphasis ours):\n\nSEC. 90003. DETENTION CAPACITY.\n\nIn addition to any amounts otherwise appropriated, there isappropriated to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, toremain available until September 30, 2029,$45,000,000,000, for single adult alien detention capacity and family residential center capacity.\n\nThe second provision, starting onPage 904, appropriated $29.85 billion to ICE for the purposes of hiring, training, recruiting and retaining officers, facility upgrades, \"promoting family unity\" by keeping detained immigrants with their children, attorneys and legal staff, funding an office supporting victims of immigration crimes and \"fleet modernization\" — presumably a reference to updating ICE aircraft and vehicles.\n\nSEC. 100052. APPROPRIATION FOR U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Homeland Securityfor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated,$29,850,000,000, to remain available through September 30, 2029.\n\nAdd the two provisions together to arrive at $74.85 billion on top of the annual base budget proposed at $11.29 billion for fiscal year 2026. The Big Beautiful Bill also imposed additional fees on people facing various immigration enforcement actions, a portion of which would go to ICE's coffers (see pages 896 and 898 ofthe bill).\n\nAccording to an April 2025publicationby theStockholm International Peace Research Institute, a highlyrespectedthink tank that collects global data on annual military spending, the \"planned total military expenditure in 2025\" for Russia was about 5.5 trillion rubles, equivalent to about $160 billion U.S. dollars — \"although the volatility of the exchange rate makes this estimate highly speculative,\" the institute warned onPage 8.\n\nThe actual amount spent, according to the institute'smilitary spending tracker, was about $149 billion U.S. dollars, assome claimsstated.\n\nAside from the constantly changing exchange rate for the ruble, it is also difficult to provide a direct comparison of Russia's spending with the ICE budget because in Russia budget yearsmatchwith calendar years, whereas in the United States budgets typically follow fiscal years. Fiscal year 2026, for example, runs from Oct. 1, 2025 to Sept. 30, 2026.\n\nFurthermore, ICE'sbudget documentsdid not include how much the agency planned to budget from the Big Beautiful Bill's allocations for fiscal year 2026. As such, it was not possible to determine ICE's exact total annual budget, as the Big Beautiful Bill stipulated a single large infusion of money — the $75 billion — to remain available to the agency for multiple years, through Sept. 30, 2029.\n\nSnopes asked ICE whether the agency can provide estimates for how much it planned to spend from Big Beautiful Bill allocations in fiscal year 2026 and awaits a response.\n\nStill, adding the $74.85 billion (available over four years) to the proposed $11.29 billion (over one budget year) makes a total of $86.14 billion that could be allocated to ICE, far less than the $160 billion estimate for Russia's planned military spending in 2025.\n\nAdvocacygroupsandreputablenewsoutletshave made estimates ranging from$150 billionto $170 billionfortotal overall immigration enforcementspending under the Big Beautiful Bill. Alongside the $75 billion for ICE, the $150 billion-to-$175 billion amount would include, for example, U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement provisions, such as $46.55 billion allocated for the border wall and $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol personnel (seePage 824).\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Harris, a Republican from North Carolina, also claimed in a July 3news releasethat the bill allocated $175 billion in \"new funding\" to \"finish securing the border.\" Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina,reportedlytold journalists back in February that the Trump administration initially asked for $175 billion in immigration enforcement funding.\n\nSnopes has not independently verified any of these estimates.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that these $150 billion-to-$175 billion estimates were focused on the Big Beautiful Bill alone. In other words, they do not appear to encompasstotalamounts of spending on immigration enforcement. For instance, aside from the amount in the Big Beautiful Bill, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requested $23 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol's base budget (seePage 4).\n\nU.S. lawmakers allocated $75 billion to ICE under the Big Beautiful Bill through Sept. 30, 2029, and Trump proposed an $11.29 billion base budget on top of that for fiscal year 2026, which Congress had not yet approved as of this writing. In contrast, a reputable think tank estimated Russia's planned military spending for 2025 at approximately $160 billion U.S. dollars, a figure subject to change due to the fluctuating exchange rate between Russian rubles and American dollars. Estimates foroverallimmigration spending, not just ICE's funding, ranged from $150 billion to $170 billion.\n\nWhile direct comparisons are not possible because the two countries present financial information differently, ICE's potential budget for fiscal year 2026 does not exceed Russia's military budget for 2025. However, overall immigration enforcement spending in the United States for fiscal year 2026 could exceed the amount Russia's military might receive in 2025.\n\nInformation from Snopes' archives was included in this story.\n\n\"AILA Denounces Passage of Draconian Immigration Spending Bill: A $150 Billion Blueprint for Mass Deportation and Fear.\"Aila.org, 1 July 2025, www.aila.org\/library\/aila-denounces-passage-of-draconian-immigration-spending-bill-a-150-billion-blueprint-for-mass-deportation-and-fear.

    "News_title":"Federal officials say a prominent Georgia Republican was running a $140 million Ponzi scheme",
    "News_text":"NEWNAN, Ga. (AP) — A prominent Georgia Republican was running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors of at least $140 million, federal officials alleged in acomplaint filed Thursday.\n\nThe civil lawsuit by theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionsaid First Liberty Building and Loan, controlled by Brant Frost IV, lied to investors about its business of making high-interest loans to companies. Instead, investigators said, it raised more money to repay earlier investors.\n\nFrost is alleged to have taken more than $19 million of investor funds for himself, his family and affiliated companies even as the business was going broke, spending $160,000 on jewelry and $335,000 with a rare coin dealer. Frost is also said to have spent $320,000 to rent a vacation home over multiple years in Kennebunkport, Maine, the town where the family of late president George H. W. Bush famously spent summers.\n\nThe SEC said Frost kept writing checks even after the commission began its investigation\n\nFirst Liberty said last month that it would stop making loans and paying interest and principal to investors in those loans. The company said it was not answering phone calls or emails.\n\nFirst Liberty has not responded to an email seeking comment, and no one was present at its office Thursday evening in Newnan, a suburb southwest of Atlanta. A lawyer who acts as the company's registered agent for corporate purposes said earlier that he had no information.\n\nThe collapse rocked the religious and political networks that the business drew investors from. It also could have ramifications in state Republican politics, cutting off funding to the far-right candidates that Frost and his family have favored. Investigators said Frost spent $570,000 from investor funds on political contributions.\n\nThe SEC said the business had only $2.67 million in cash as of May 30, although regulators are also seeking to claw back money from Frost and associated companies. With 300 investors out $140 million, that means the average investor put in nearly $500,000.\n\nFirst Liberty said it made loans to companies that needed cash while they waited for more conventional loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. It charged high rates of interest — 18% on some loans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. First Liberty promised investors equally high rates of return — 16% on the 18% loans.\n\nIn recent months the business advertised heavily on conservative radio shows promising “Wall Street returns for Main Street investors.”\n\n“The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,” Justin C. Jeffries, associate director of enforcement for the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement.\n\nThe company has represented that it is “cooperating with federal authorities as part of an effort to accomplish an orderly wind-up of the business.” The SEC said Frost and his companies agreed to the SEC's enforcement actions “with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.”\n\nWhile the SEC says there were loans to companies, as many as 90% of those companies have defaulted. By 2021 the company was running as a Ponzi scheme, the complaint said, even as Frost withdrew increasing amounts of money.\n\nThe business is being investigated by the Georgia secretary of state for possible violations of securities law said Robert Sinners, a spokesperson for the office.\n\nA 2023 document obtained by the AP is titled as a “promissory note,” and Sinners said anyone issuing promissory notes is supposed to be registered with Georgia securities officials.\n\nSinners encouraged any victims to contact the state Securities Division.\n\nFederal prosecutors have declined to comment on whether they are considering criminal charges. Sometimes both an SEC civil case and a federal criminal case are filed over investment frauds.\n\nFrost has been an important player in Georgia politics since 1988, when he coordinated televangelistPat Robertson’sRepublican presidential bid in the state. His son, Brant Frost V, is chairman of the Coweta County Republican Party, where the company is based, and is a former second vice-chair of the state Republican Party. Daughter Katie Frost is Republican chairman of the 3rd Congressional District, which includes Coweta County and other areas southwest of Atlanta.\n\nAt last month’s state Republican convention, Katie Frost chaired a nominating committee that recommended delegates reelect state Party ChairmanJosh McKoon. Delegates followed that recommendation, rejecting a number of insurgent candidates.",

    "News_text":"The journey of cryptocurrency trading constantly evolves and has been nothing short of revolutionary. Right from the start, the cryptocurrency landscape has been referred to as the “wild west” due to its nature of decentralisation and minimal oversight. However, now the space consists of increasingly sophisticated and regulated financial products and the transformation has been profound. The shift in perception has been a critical development in driving the need for robust frameworks that foster institutional adoption and, crucially, boost investor confidence.\n\nIn its infancy, crypto trading was the domain of early tech evangelists and a niche community of retail investors leveraging the premise of decentralised permissionless finance. Bitcoin embodied this concept, and exchanges with varying degrees of transparency facilitated the trading of bitcoin and the introduction of other altcoins. Liquidity was thin, price swings were extreme and the lack of regulation meant significant risks for participants.\n\nThe “wild west” held huge appeal due to the promise of innovation and the disruption of traditional finance. Yet this unregulated environment also bred systemic vulnerabilities, i.e., frequent exchange hacks, pump-and-dump schemes and a lack of consumer protection. Back then,events such as the Mt. Gox collapsedeterred larger financial institutions and a broader retail audience from engaging in digital assets.\n\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\n\nWe’d love your feedback! CoinDesk is conducting a confidential survey.Start Survey.\n\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\n\nAs the crypto market cap swelled,particularly during the ICO boom of 2017and subsequent bull runs, so did the demand for regulatory oversight. Most regulators adopted a wait-and-see approach; however, incidents within the space, driven by market volatility and concerns over illicit financing, pushed the agenda for regulation forward.\n\nThe perception and overall sentiment of regulatory oversight have shifted. It is now a common concept that effective regulation is not about stifling innovation, but about supporting and enabling growth and integrating crypto into the broader financial system.\n\nWhat’s underpinning the regulatory shift happening within the industry? It is the recognition that regulation isn’t a hindrance but rather a catalyst for trust and adoption. An example of this is the recent approval of spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in major financial markets. These investment products provide institutional and retail investors with exposure to the underlying cryptocurrency through regulated platforms, unlocking massive liquidity and further labelling cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. This development was unimaginable a few years ago.\n\nThe European Union's comprehensiveMarkets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, which began to be phased in 2024, is another huge milestone for the evolution of cryptocurrency trading. MiCA aims to create a harmonised regulatory framework across all EU member states, covering the issuance of crypto-assets, their public offering and the services provided by Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). With the European Union leading the way here, other major government bodies will surely follow.\n\nWhile the early crypto market was a hotbed for speculative assets such as memecoins, the maturation within the space has led to a demand for trading ‘blue-chip’ tokens. These are typically the most liquid and well-capitalised cryptocurrencies that have proven their resilience across various market cycles. Traders are increasingly gravitating towards these more stable assets, seeking long-term growth potential rather than chasing the more risky, fleeting crypto trends. Providers are also leaning towards offering these types of assets as part of their commitment to responsible trading.\n\nThe \"wild west\" era of crypto trading is fast becoming a distant memory, replaced by a new paradigm of regulated innovation. This evolution is not just vital for the long-term sustainability and mainstream adoption of digital assets, but also for building a more secure and accessible global financial system.",

    "News_title":"Trump to tour flood zone on Friday as he touts ties to deep-red Texas",
    "News_text":"President Donald Trump is expected to tour areas struck by the Texas flash floods on Friday as thestate comes to terms with a natural disaster that has left hundreds dead and missing.\n\nTexas Republican Governor Greg Abbott has repeatedly praised theTrump administration for its response to the tragedy this week,despite the White House having made severe cutbacks to climate and weather agencies, and even as Trump officials continue to argue for the elimination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThe relationship between Abbott and Trump is contrastedto that between the president and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who met Trump in January following devastating wildfires in the Golden State. Trump and Newsom argued over water access during the blaze that destroyed thousands of structures and caused a dozen fatalities.\n\nThose critical of the president argue that Trump’s handling of the two disastersreveals how he appears to politicize events depending on their location.\n\nJeremy Edwards, who served as a spokesperson for FEMA and the Biden White House, said he thinks if the floods had occurred under aDemocratic administration, Trump’s response would have been different.\n\n“I find it very hard to imagine that if this exact situation were to happen in a blue state with a Democratic governor, he would not immediately lambast them for steps that they did or didn’t take with regards to emergency alerts,” said Edwards,according toThe Hill.\n\n“I think this is going to be the same thing he does with the economy. When the economy is bad, it’s Biden’s economy. When the economy is good, it’s Trump’s economy,” he added. “And I think, if the response and recovery goes well — and I hope it does — it’s Trump’s FEMA, but if the response goes badly, it’s Biden’s FEMA.”\n\nMichael Coen served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\n“What I’d seen during the Obama administration and the Biden administration is presidents working with governors, regardless of party, to support the impacted community, whether it was inFloridawith Biden and Gov. DeSantis working side by side following the Surfside building collapse,Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Milton … putting politics aside,” Coen said.\n\n“Until this administration, I really haven’t seen emergency management being politicized the way it is,” he added.\n\nAbbott is set to accompany Trump in Texas as the president meets with first responders and receives a briefing from local officials. He will also meet with family members affected by the floods.\n\nNewsom greeted Trump at the airport when the president visited the state just after taking office. However, just before the trip, Trump issued a threat to withhold federal aid because of concerns regarding California’s water management.\n\nIn Texas, other issues are arising, such as theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes theNational Weather Service, which eliminated hundreds of employees earlier this year. The warning meteorologist at the NWS office for Austin andSan Antonio, which covers Kerr County, which was hardest hit by the floods, took a buyout in April, organized by the Trump administration.\n\nKristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, is also set to join Trump in Texas. She initially visited the area on Saturday. She said this week that FEMA should be “remade” amid its response to the floods. Both the secretary and the president have argued that the states should handle disaster responses.\n\n“We, as a federal government, don’t manage these disasters. The state does. We come in and support them, and that’s exactly what we did here in this situation,” said Noem.\n\nFEMA has been in the sights of Republicans since Hurricane Helene struckNorth Carolinalast year. Rumors began to be spread suggesting the agency was avoiding helping red-leaning areas and Republican households. The theories, at times, hindered the Biden administration's aid efforts.\n\nA former Bush administration official said, “Disaster politics are always tricky, but this tragedy is amid the backdrop ofDOGEand the administration’s broader efforts to reduce the federal role in disaster response,” according toThe Hill.\n\n“The president and the governor get along well and are very simpatico on immigration, but these situations normally receive a level of empathy that this president does not like to display,” the ex-official added.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump praised Abbott.\n\n“The relationship with Texas and the governor has been obviously very good for years, with me,” he said. “The response has been incredible, and the fact that we got along so well, I don’t even think that’s a political thing, but we got along so well, and it was so unified. I think a lot of lives have been saved.”",

    "News_text":"By Felix Light\n\nGHORJOMI, Georgia (Reuters) -In the Georgian highland village of Ghorjomi, Friday prayers in the local mosque are always packed, says imam Tamaz Gorgadze.\n\nTucked away in the remote valleys close to the Turkish border, Ghorjomi – and the surrounding region of Upper Adjara – are a rare outpost of Islam in one of the world's most devoutly Christian countries.\n\n\"We live in Georgia, a multiconfessional country,\" he told Reuters in June, after prayers for the Eid ul-Adha religious festival.\n\nGeorgia was the second country in the world to adopt Christianity as its state religion around the year 319, behind only neighbouring Armenia.\n\nIt remains devoutly Christian, and national identity closely linked to centuries of struggle against Muslim Persian and Turkic invaders.\n\nStill today, Adjara's Muslim Georgians are derisively dubbed \"Tatars\" by some, referring to a Muslim ethnic group in Russia.\n\nAccording to census data, around 10% of Georgia’s 3.6 million people are Muslims. The bulk of them belong to the mostly Shi’ite Azerbaijani minority.\n\nBut ethnically Georgian Muslims, unique to Adjara, are rarer and more controversial in a country whose national flag consists of five Christian crosses.\n\nThe country's powerful Orthodox Church is seen as a custodian of Georgian identity, and for many, membership of the church is a prerequisite for being truly Georgian.\n\nHowever, for the Georgians of Upper Adjara, who were converted to Islam during centuries spent as part of the Ottoman Empire, there is nothing contradictory in being both a practicing Muslim and a patriotic Georgian.\n\n\"We are proud that we are Georgians. We have a shared past,\" said Tariel Nakaidze, a Ghorjomi native and head of the Georgian Muslims Union.\n\nNevertheless, said Nakaidze, Georgian Muslims experience social pressures he likened to anti-religious campaigns under the Soviet Union.\n\nHe said: \"During the Soviet Union in Georgia, both Christians and Muslims had to live a double life. On the outside, you were an atheist.

    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nSubscribe here:Apple Podcasts|Spotify|YouTube|Overcast|Pocket Casts\n\nSinceThe Atlanticfirst released the podcastAutocracy in Americalast fall, Donald Trump was elected president again. Staff writer Anne Applebaum describes how Trump’s return to the White House fits into the changing geopolitical landscape as she hands the show over to its new host: Garry Kasparov. The former world chess champion and lifelong democracy activist will guide a series of conversations about society’s complacency with liberal values and how this carelessness has fueled a democratic retreat—and a new belligerence among dictators.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\n[Music]\n\nAnne Applebaum:FromThe Atlantic, this isAutocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. Last summer, I made the first series of this podcast together with my friend and colleague Peter Pomerantsev. We were not trying to predict the future. Instead, we looked at some of the ways in which the United States had already adopted practices common in the autocratic world.\n\nJefferson Cowie:My nightmare is that fascism comes to America, but it’s marching under the banner of freedom.\n\nApplebaum:We talked about the use of violence and intimidation in politics.\n\nStephen Richer:It’s a little bit like the Eye of Sauron. With that—when it’s turned on you, you feel it. You get a lot of ugliness directed your way.\n\nApplebaum:About the abuse of courts and about kleptocracy.\n\nSheldon Whitehouse:This is a new beast that is stalking America’s political landscape.\n\nApplebaum:About older American traditions of state capture.\n\nRichard White:He would choose all the boards and commissions. He packed the courts. And, once you have the courts and the legislature—and you’ve already got the executive—you have all three branches of government.\n\n[Music out]\n\nApplebaum:Now, in Donald Trump’s second presidency, all of those autocratic behaviors are being accelerated, amplified, even promoted by the federal government. He’s fired civil servants.\n\nCNN Newsclip:Breaking overnight. First, paid leave. Then, buyouts. Now, firings.\n\nApplebaum:He seeks to replace them with loyalists and seeks to intimidate enemies and political rivals.\n\nLaura Barron Lopez:He wants loyalty across the board with little to no resistance. That is his top goal.\n\nApplebaum:Above all, Trump has adopted the practices of kleptocracy on a scale no previous American president ever imagined.\n\nScott Galloway:I think we’ve essentially become a kleptocracy that would make [Vladimir] Putin blush.\n\nApplebaum:But while brand new in the history of America, Trump’s actions are very familiar to those who have studied the rise of autocracy in other places. Garry Kasparov, who has not merely studied the rise of Putinism in Russia, but lived through it and fought against it, is now joiningAutocracy in Americato host our new season.\n\nSome of you will know Garry as a former world chess champion—indeed, one of the greatest chess players who ever lived. But Garry also has a long record opposing the rise of Putinism, well before it was fashionable. So at a moment when Western companies were still piling into Russia, when democratic leaders allowed Russia to host the G8 summit in St. Petersburg, Garry told a really different story. I looked up something that I wrote about him in 2007. And I found this quote; this is something he wrote inThe Wall Street Journal. He said, “Russia is in a moment of crisis, and every decent person must stand up and resist the rise of the Putin dictatorship.”\n\n[Music]\n\nApplebaum:As I noted at the time, this was a pretty lonely view. It was not shared in London, where I lived at the time, and there wasn’t even that much reaction in Russia. Although an angry fan did hit him over the head with a chessboard. And Garry, who’s now with us, said, “I’m lucky the national sport of the Soviet Union is chess, not baseball.”\n\n[Music out]\n\nApplebaum:Garry, welcome.\n\nGarry Kasparov:Thank you very much, Anne, for reminding me about this very precarious moment.\n\nBecause this angry fan was of course on the Kremlin’s payroll. Since the moment when he hit me with the chessboard, immediately it appeared online. So, the videos were made from two different angles.\n\nSo somebody was waiting for the moment. I guess they wanted me just to get crazy and just to hit him and to ask my bodyguard to attack him. But I decided to keep my calm, which was not easy. But again, thank God it was not a baseball bat. So I’m really, you know, really happy just to continue the program. And I think it’s probably worth, you know, just reminding the audience that, you know, first time we met and worked together it was 10 years ago, and it was not in America, but in Canada. We joined forces at a debate. The Munk Debates. It’s a probably largest public debate in Canada, Oxford-style. So we faced 3,000 people, and the opposition was Stephen Cohen, pro-Putin, U.S. scholar, very famous, and Vladimir Pozner, who has been working for Soviet propaganda since, I think, 1961—before we were born. And we had to deal with a very, very, difficult task, because the house motion was: The West should engage, not isolate, Russia.\n\nApplebaum:Yeah, yeah. It wasBe it resolved that the West should engage and not isolate Russia, which of course was what the Canadian audience wanted.\n\nKasparov:Exactly. It was one year after Crimea’s annexation and the beginning of the war in Ukraine. But still, the mood of the audience was not in our favor. But we proved to be a very good team, and we won, which I think was quite a shock for our opponents—and for many in the audience, because again, it was Canada. So that was the beginning of our cooperation. But I’m just wondering: Could you, in your worst nightmares, imagine that 10 years since this debate in Canada, we would be talking about the real threat to America shifting sides, and no longer being a beacon of hope, the guardian of democracy, but becoming a potential ally for “Autocracy Inc.” worldwide?\n\nApplebaum:I have to say that I did not imagine it. I mean, it’s funny. Roundabout 2014, 2015—that was when I started following the rise of Russian propaganda and influence campaigns, mostly in Europe. I saw them in Poland; I saw them in the Czech Republic; I saw them in Hungary. And I even wrote something about it at the time, and I remember talking to people about it in Washington. And people said,Well, this is all very terrible, you know, for Slovenia, and we feel really bad. But it, again, it felt like a very distant problem. And really, just a year or two later, in 2016, we saw the Russian influence campaign being conducted in the United States. And since then, the gradual accumulation of, as I said, these authoritarian practices and behavior in American politics.\n\nAnd we are now at a point where it doesn’t sound crazy to talk about the Putinization of America. Or the rise of Russian-style kleptocracy in America. So it’s been a really extraordinary decade. I mean, it’s really been one in which the United States has gone from one polar opposite. From a symbol of, it’s not just …democracymight even be the wrong word. It’s about the rule of law. It’s about transparency; it’s about accountability. It’s about Americans believing in freedom, and Americans having allies and being part of this network of other rule-of-law countries in the world. And we’ve gone from that to being a really rogue power which seeks to break up all of our alliances and maybe instead do deals with dictatorships. You know, you, as I said at the beginning, you were an early observer of the changes in Russia that created the system that we saw today. Tell me: When you look at the first months of the second Trump administration, do you see something similar? What’s setting off alarm bells in your head?\n\nKasparov:The similarities are really frightening. It’s a creation of classical oligarchy. And I think many Americans, they get confused, because they believe that any rich person who is buying influence is an oligarch. But by my classification, when you look at Putin’s Russia, you should disregard the simple spread of this word for any rich man. [John D.] Rockefeller, [Andrew] Carnegie, in the past, J. P. Morgan. Or now we just have [Jeff] Bezos, [Mark] Zuckerberg. I still wouldn’t call themoligarchs, because—while they are buying influence, clearly, so that’s what happens in any representative democracy—they are not involved in the decision-making process. What we saw with [Elon] Musk and Trump, it’s basically creating money and power. It’s like centaur in the same hands. That’s what Putin did. So it’s a gradual merge, or synergy, between those who control money and those directly making decisions. It’s not about trying to find, you know, buying favors from Democrats or Republicans. It’s basically sticking to one group of people that are under your control and making decisions. Also, Trump’s statements—to my trained ear, it’s loud and clear. He disregarded the Democratic opposition, basically saying,I can rule only relying on Republican votes.That’s a proclamation of a one-party system. We can definitely give Trump credit for being very consistent. He has been pushing through his agenda, ignoring the laws of the land, and always, you know, just trying to bully people. That’s also a typical sign of this early oligarchy where, you know, you don’t have resources to go against everybody, but you pick a few best targets, and you go after them. And the rest have no choice but to obey. Unless they want to feel the power of the dictator’s wrath.\n\nApplebaum:Yeah, and then I was going to say in the case of Putin’s Russia, it was even more brutal. So if you kill one journalist, then all the other journalists are afraid.\n\nKasparov:Yeah, exactly. You kill one journalist; you start closing TV stations. And then you go after the richest man in the country. So you basically confiscate his company, put him in jail. And the rest recognize that it’s time to play by the new rules.\n\nSo again, Trump is facing much tougher challenge, because American democracy has 250 years, even if we do not count the colonial years, that also had the rule of law as a basis for society. Russia, it’s never experienced the long period of law and order, in its normal, democratic terms. But still, you know, certain things are just, you know, just have to ring the bell. It’s an alarm. When they say,Oh, it’s urgent, there’s a mandate.The president had a mandate we have to push through. And if the judiciary is standing in the way, to hell with them. So the moment you hear urgency that should go over or should trump—pun intended—should trump the rule of law, that’s another sign that they are aiming at the very center of America’s democracy. It’s a separation of powers.\n\nApplebaum:Yeah, it’s exactly what Putin does. I mean, Putin—because of the war, it’s an emergency. Therefore he has special powers.\n\nKasparov:But it was always emergency. It was always emergency. In 2004 after this, the tragedy in Beslan when the terrorists, you know, took over the school, and then Putin used it immediately to gain more power by canceling the direct elections of the governors. So that’s—again, it’s every crisis, is always used to enlarge the portfolio of an autocrat. And, again, Trump is facing much more formidable opposition. But he’s trying, I mean, we can’t deny that he’s trying. And, unlike his first presidency, it seems that, again, it says Trump already, succeeded in creating a … I wouldn’t say political class, but it’s a cluster in American politics that is just, you know, following him, obediently. Without any questions. Repeating even the most outrageous lies and statements, that even by the first Trump administration would be unheard.\n\nApplebaum:You know, this is the thing that surprises Europeans the most. Europeans—who’ve been dealing with Americans for years and years in security contexts, economic contexts, business, and so on—[are] discovering that there is this group of Americans who are sycophants. Because nobody ever thought of Americans being like that. But it turns out that you can win them over, or can bully them in such a way that they do exactly as you say. They provide a kind of echo chamber—even to lies. I mean, it’s funny, talking about lies. What’s also surprising to me is the way in which the Trump administration, Trump himself, use lies in the way that dictators use them. In other words, Trump isn’t trying to—for example, as the Soviet Union once did, he’s not trying to create a full story about reality. That, if we all work together and cooperate, then eventually we’re going to build communism.\n\nKasparov:No narrative. No fixed narrative.\n\nApplebaum:Exactly. Instead, the idea is just to lie constantly, all the time, about almost everything—whether it’s the price of eggs or the price of gas, or what he said to Putin yesterday. Or, you know, whatever it is, he’s lying. And this has another effect. I mean, what it does is: It makes people doubt whether anything is true. I mean, how are you supposed to know what’s true if the president lies all the time? And that is, of course, exactly the same tactic that Putin used in Russia. I mean, if you lie or your propagandists lie nonstop, then the reaction of the public is to say,Right, you know, politics is a dirty game. I have no idea what’s true or what’s not true. I better just stay home.\n\nKasparov:Absolutely. You know, a constant lie becomes a very important test for loyalty. Because you want to make sure that your sycophants—your administration, your appointees—they follow you without asking questions. And you want to test them, so they have to repeat the same lies. They have to defend these lies. And they know Trump was lying, And they still had no choice, either. Okay. They have a choice. Either you leave, or you keep lying. And so far, I didn’t see anyone leaving. So it seems that, again, Trump still has his hold over a new American bureaucracy, that is just, again, willing to do whatever. Just to stay in power.\n\n[Music]\n\nApplebaum:More on that, after the break.\n\n[Midroll]\n\nApplebaum:You know, there’s something you wrote inThe Atlanticthis spring, and you were calling on the opposition to Trump to defend the value system that has made America great. You know this question of values underlines, I know, a lot of what you wanna tackle in this season of the show. Say more about it. What’s this value system that you, as an outsider, identify with America?\n\nKasparov:I think now we just have to identify—that’s the threat to American democracy. And I believe it’s an existential threat. And that means, to defend it, we have to abandon some conflicts that separated American society. It’s normal. We have many issues where we can, you know, argue, we can disagree. But the key is that we always relied on the framework created by the Founding Fathers that allowed us to debate these issues. One day, you know, we win. One day we lose. But again, it was a healthy process. And sometimes, you know, maybe just, too hot, you know, the arguments just were fierce, but it was just—it was a debate. So it seems now that this framework is in great danger. Now it’s time to get together to fight for these constitutional values. That’s something that made America America. And recognizing that Trump’s actions, though they look very spontaneous and sporadic, they are aimed at this very system. To make sure that the balance that has been working for two and a half centuries—the balance between the executive, legislation, and judiciary—this balance will be tilted forever in favor of the executive. And not just executive as an office, but just executive as one person. Again, here is Trump, very consistent, demanding that the president has all powers and anything that stands in his way, even if it’s guaranteed by Constitution, should be removed—because it prevents him from executing his mandate. Which is, again: It’s a funny trick, because at the end of the day, Trump acquired his powers going through the system that created this mandate. And now—trying to use this mandate acquired within the system—he’s trying to destroy the system and to make sure that he and his cronies, his successors, could rule the country without any restrictions that have been provided by this very constitutional framework that made him win in the first place.\n\nApplebaum:So the values are separation of powers, really, and the rule of law?\n\nKasparov:Absolutely. This is the rule of law, separation of powers, and recognizing that there’s always a balance that keeps very complicated American system, Republican system—Republicans will all, of course—to function and to be so successful. Because there are always forces and counterforces. So whether it’s the federal level, state level, whether it’s judiciary, legislation, so it’s the, [any attempt to spread unanimity. So that’s what is a real existential threat to American republic. Just, yeah. Quite ironic—it’s next year, will be the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nAnd if you just read through the Declaration of Independence, almost every claim there—all the grievances of the colonies, again, King George and British monarchy—have been simply resurrected in Trump’s behavior.\n\nApplebaum:It is funny, actually: I reread the Declaration of Independence, too, recently, and there’s even something about tariffs. There’s something about sending people abroad to be imprisoned.\n\nKasparov:Absolutely. It’s so many elements of the Declaration of Independence, and of course the Constitution. So, I think by fighting such a powerful enemy—because again, we know that, again, Trump is not accidental. And that’s one of the ideas of the second season, is to talk to different people. From different fields—Americans and Europeans—and to give our audience an idea, somehow, why Trump was inevitable. I mean, what’s happened? What are the events that helped Trump to become almost invincible in American politics?\n\nAnd what are the other trends in global politics, in geopolitics, that made this overall climate so friendly not just to Trump, but to many other would-be autocrats, right-wing populists, across other democracies? Yeah; it’s very important to see this big picture. Because to fight Trump is not, you know, just simply to go,Trump is bad. It’s very important to show why it’s bad.\n\nApplebaum:You know, it’s interesting. In the first season of this podcast, one of our episodes was about American alliances. And it’s actually one of my arguments that I’ve been making for a long time—that American democracy has also succeeded in the past because of who America’s allies were. That it was very important, not just for our foreign policy, that we were very close to the European democracies or the Asian democracies. That that also reinforced our domestic politics. In other words, you know, that it matters who your country’s friends are. And so, I suppose, maybe one of the things you’ll explore is: Does it matter if America’s friends are the German far right and the Romanian far right and autocracies in the Middle East?\n\nKasparov:Yes. But it’s like chicken and egg. So it’s whether these alliances embolden Trump or, you know, that America’s change from within help Trump to build these alliances. So think it will be wrong to actually oppose Trump without understanding all these underlying currents—you know, all the factors that made Trump and Trump’s phenomena, both domestically and internationally, such a powerful threat. Not just to American democracy, but to democracy worldwide.\n\nAnd of course, Putin, as we know, he’s very happy to support whoever. So he’s happy with Marine le Pen in France, but he’s also happy with [Jean-Luc] Mélenchon, who’s far left. Of course, AfD for Germany [the far-right party Alternative for Germany] is his biggest bet in German politics. But, Russia was not shy of supporting Die Linke and the new newly built [Bündnis] Sahra Wagenknecht. Also, far-left groups. So, for me, it indicates the collapse of the traditional left-right balance that has been, you know, in place for probably nearly a century. And I will talk about it throughout the new series. But: Do you think, Anne, it’s a legitimate, you know, issue, just to recognize why this right, left—or center, right-center, left—equilibrium that served us for so long is no longer, you know, protecting us against the rise of authoritarianism?\n\nApplebaum:Yeah. No, I think it’s indicative of something even bigger—which is that politics, which for such a long time was about policy. In other words, what was the, what were the center left and the center right fighting about? They were fighting about the size of the state and whether taxes should be high or low, and whether we should have state health care or private health care. And those were the subjects of politics and the subjects of political debate. And what’s happened over the last decade—partly thanks to the change in the nature of online information, partly thanks to the way that social media has reordered our conversation and made it more emotional and angry and divisive—those things aren’t central to politics anymore. And instead, politics is about these very existential issues. Cultural ideas, national identity, other kinds of identity. Issues where there’s much less area for compromise, and where there’s much less that the different various parties can do together. I mean, so if you have an argument about taxes, you can find a compromise between the center left and the center right. If your argument isWho are Americans? And should people of only one skin color get to be Americans? And, if people come from another country, and they don’t come through the border in the right way, they should be expelled, or not expelled?I mean, those are much more existential issues, and there’s very little area of compromise. You also have the rise of political movements that challenge the system itself. And this is, of course, something that I think happened over the last four years, after January the 6th. Really, all of the extremists in America—and this happened in other countries, too, for different reasons—gathered around Trump. So, people who believed that there shouldn’t be democracy in America, there should be a kind of CEO who runs politics—that was a kind of tech-authoritarian idea. People who believe that America shouldn’t be a secular state; it should be a religious state. That’s the Christian-nationalist idea.\n\nAnd a series of people who were on the extremes of politics were drawn to him. And drawn into really the center of political life. And they have now redefined political debate. And, as I said, political debate is not anymore about practical policies that people can understand. Instead, it’s about these central, you know:Should Harvard exist?OrDo we want science?And it changed the nature of debate altogether. And of course, one of the things that has been very slow to happen is that the center—meaning the center left and the center right—failed for a long time to understand that the rules of debate had changed. So they went on squabbling with one another. You can actually see it right now in Germany, in the German coalition, which is the center-right\/center-left coalition. They went on squabbling about the things that divided them, failing to see that there was a threat from people who wanted to change the nature of the system altogether. So what we really have now is a pretty existential argument between liberal democracy, small-lliberal, small-ddemocracy, and an authoritarian system run by an executive who is not controlled by the rule of law. That’s actually the real debate we have right now. But, it’s taken a long time for the rest of the political world to understand that and catch up with it, and to understand that in order to defeat the appeal of the autocratic world, we need different kinds of coalitions.\n\nKasparov:But that also includes international coalitions. Because, you know, we use the wordexistentialregularly, but the most existential battle between the force of tyranny and freedom now is happening in Ukraine. Literally the battlefield where the force of autocracy—Autocracy Inc., led by Putin’s dictatorship—launched the most blatant invasion of the country. And it’s much bigger than just an attempt to redraw the borders. It’s a challenge, open challenge, to the existing world order—probably, it’s no longer existing; it’s collapsing. The liberal world order that we used to live in for decades. And the outcome of this battle, the outcome of this existential, mortal combat, will probably, most likely, will decide the future of humanity and future of freedom worldwide for decades to come. And, it’s not surprising that the war in Ukraine also divides political forces here. And it’s not, it’s no longer, right and left. You can find people on both sides defending Ukraine. And unfortunately, you can find people on both sides—mostly, of course, on the right now—who are trying to undermine the Ukrainian heroic struggle for freedom and sovereignty. And to argue that it’s no longer our business to be involved.\n\nApplebaum:Yeah; I mean, what you’ve just described, it’s one of the arguments of my bookAutocracy, Inc.Which is that while we’ve been failing to understand the importance of these new coalitions, the autocratic world has understood it. And you now have a de facto coalition or network that’s been created by Russia, by China, by theocratic Iran, by Bolivarian-socialist Venezuela. By countries actually with very different systems—some of them are one-party states, some of them are one-man dictatorships—but who’ve understood that it’s very important for them to work together to undermine the idea of democracy. One of Putin’s great realizations was that it wasn’t enough to undermine the democrats he was fighting at home, and it wasn’t enough to poison the political debate inside Russia with lies and alternative reality. That he had to spread that farther—that really he needed to destroy the appeal of democracy everywhere. And part of the purpose of the invasion of Ukraine was to show that there’s no sense or purpose to lead to having a democratic revolution of the kind that took place in Ukraine. That democracies are doomed to failure, and that they can be defeated by a much more brutal, a much angrier, form of autocratic power.\n\nKasparov:Yeah, absolutely. So that’s why I will do my best, throughout episodes of this second season to show this connection. You have Ukraine; you have the collapse of the traditional center-right\/center-left coalition. Also the rise of AI and how AI has been playing a role in this fake-news industry and with new attempts of the tech bros to take control of the political system and electoral process. So it’s looking at the big picture and hearing the voices from the Baltics to the United States. So: people that are experts, who have great experience in their field, to go to the roots of this global Trump phenomena. And find, you know, just throughout this conversation, find the best way for us to get together and win the battle.\n\n[Music]\n\nKasparov:And that means voices from all over the political spectrum, people who disagree about many things but have in common the desire to protect democracy. Because, again: It is an existential threat. Which requires just this total mobilization of our forces if we want to preserve what was given to us 250 years ago.\n\nApplebaum:So it sounds to me like this show is in very capable hands, which I’m delighted to hear. Tell me, what’s the first conversation?\n\nKasparov:It seems that the best one to begin with, to set the table for us about an American electorate gone amok with both apathy and partisanship. And we’ll talk with an excellent pollster and someone I know for many years: Frank Luntz.\n\nFrank Luntz:All the institutions that keep America moving forward are disliked and distrusted.\n\nKasparov:Okay. This is, it’s very, very important, because you said a few times the word, the key word, in my opinion:trust.\n\nLuntz:Yes. That is—by the way, let’s stop there. That is the key word. It’s the No. 1 priority that Americans have: trust and truth.\n\nApplebaum:Well, thank you, Garry. I’m looking forward to hearing the second season ofAutocracy in America.\n\nKasparov:Anne, I hope you will not be disappointed. Thank you.

    "News_title":"What If the Political Pendulum Doesn’t Swing Back?",
    "News_text":"The pendulum will swing back. It is a phrase invoked repeatedly, with variation, since Donald Trump’s reelection last November. Cable news anchorChris Cuomo,Senator Angus King, and pollsterNate Silverhave all invoked it to some degree. Presidential biographer Jon Meacham recentlypredictedthat the pendulum would swing from a Donald Trump presidency to “thepresidencyof AOC.” The phrase conjures history, the past as prologue. The “pendulum”—the vagaries of change, the slow pace of history—will shift back to Democrats soon. Americans will tire of the status quo that Trump built. The MAGA movement will fall.\n\nTalk of history, particularly American political history, in such ways returns us to the life and career of historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. For it was Schlesinger Jr.’s 1986 book,The Cycles of American History,that popularized the idea that American politics shifts from liberalism to conservatism, and back again, within every generation. Schlesinger also used the term “pendulum” to describe this shift. But whereas pendulums can only move back and forth, Schlesinger Jr. argued that history moveswithinitself, its phases interacting in ways that blur the origins of the present—hence a “cycle.” American history, he wrote, has circulated between “public action and private interest” since the early 1800s. “War, depression, inflations, may heighten or complicate moods,” he wrote in his second chapter, “but the cycle itself rolls on, self-contained, self-sufficient, and autonomous.”\n\nSchlesinger Jr. wrote these words in another era of conservative dominance. President Ronald Reagan had trounced former Vice President Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential election, winning every state but Minnesota and capturing the largest number of Electoral College votes in American history. Since coming to office in 1981, Reagan had attracted the traditional constituents of the Democratic Party (blue-collar, working-class, union voters, as well as Blacks and Hispanics)—into the GOP, in what commentators at the time referred to as the “Reagan revolution.” The Democrats floundered for relevance and a strategic path over the next eight years, lost in incredulity at their collapse and the quest for a new coalition.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nRevisitingThe Cycles of American Historyin 2025 helps us make sense of how much the “Trump revolution,” if it can be called that, is indebted to the dynamics of American politics—Americans’ perennial search for something new or different in a two-party system. But the book also reveals the limits of relying on “whiggish history,” of teleological narratives, to forecast the future. Schlesinger tried to show that the American experiment is conditioned to face challenges from the right—and in fact, those challenges are natural, endemic, and essential to our politics—and with “hard work at the experiment,” liberal democracy will naturally prevail.\n\nBut nothing seemsnaturalabout our current age. Progress is elusive, if not illusionary. In 2020, Joe Biden’s election as president offered an antidote to four years of dysfunction and chaos, of unrepentant xenophobia and nationalism. By the measure of Schlesinger’s thesis, history had worked. It did what it was destined to do.\n\nBut the pendulum swung quickly and forcefully back with Trump’s reelection in 2024 and now even seems in a retrograde state. And while we know that history will outlast him, what, when the “age of Trump” is over, will we return to?\n\nArthur Schlesinger Jr. did not create the idea that history operates in cycles. He inherited it.\n\nBorn in Ohio in October 1917, Schlesinger Jr. followed in the authorial footsteps of his father, Arthur Schlesinger Sr., who taught history at Harvard for three decades and wrote multiple books on the American Revolution and urban life, before retiring in 1954. Schlesinger Sr. had first proposed a new theory of “cycles” in American history in his December 1939 article inYale Review, “The Tides of American Politics.” Quoting Thomas Jefferson, he identified two classes of people in American politics: those who “fear the people, and wish to transfer all power to the higher classes of society” and those who “consider the people as the safest depository of power in the last resort; they cherish them, therefore, and wish to leave in them all the powers to the exercise of which they are competent.”\n\nSchlesinger Sr. posited 10 eras in postcolonial American history in which one political point of view held sway over the other. Each conservative era had “an average of 15 years,” while every liberal era lasted 16.5 years. In putting precise numbers to historical ages, Schlesinger Sr. took inspiration from Henry Adams, who in the late nineteenth century sought to apply scientific principles to history—part of his attempts to develop a “theory of the universe.” Schlesinger Sr. concluded that every 12 years of American history “measured the beat of the pendulum.”\n\nHis division of liberal and conservative eras was instrumental in the development of the cyclical theory of political history. He predicted the “revolt against conservatism” that gave rise to the New Deal and the presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (the “Roosevelt revolution”) would “last until 1947 or 1948” and that Americans would not see another liberal era until “the neighborhood of 1963.”\n\nFor decades, history seemed to vindicate the cyclical theory of history. Republicans did gain control of both houses of Congress by 1947, passing legislation such as the Taft-Hartley Act that weakened collective bargaining and the power of labor unions. Roosevelt’s vice president, Harry Truman, eked out a presidential win in 1948, but his “Fair Deal”—designs for full employment and universal health care—was stymied by Republicans, and his foreign policy became defined by the Korean War, leading to the election of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952.\n\nSchlesinger Jr. made his own name as a liberal intellectual in the postwar era. His first book,The Age of Jackson(1945), received the Pulitzer Prize for its depiction of Andrew Jackson as a key figure in the transformation of democracy in nineteenth-century America—although it conspicuously left out Jackson’s racism and how his slaughter of the Cherokee Nation continued after the Supreme Court’s efforts to stop it. Schlesinger Jr. even regarded FDR—a populist, a “traitor to his class,” who expanded democracy, particularly economic democracy, through his New Deal programs—as the successor to Jackson’s political tradition.\n\nThe Age of Jacksonestablished Schlesinger Jr. as a serious historian, and he soon became a torchbearer forCold War liberalism. In its early years, Schlesinger tried to distance liberals—including himself—from being too closely associated with the left, lest they be branded as Communists. His next book,The Vital Center(1949), made the case for “opposing the extremes of tyranny” from the left and the right. The right needed to admit that the New Deal reforms were not communistic (“Roosevelt hated socialists”), but the left was also inattentive to the threat of authoritarianism from the Soviet Union. The left did not need Marx anymore, Schlesinger wrote; no one did.The Vital Centersoon became the bible of Cold War centrism.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Schlesinger blurred the lines between historian and partisan. For much of the 1950s, he worked on his unfinished Age of Roosevelt series, a three-volume history of the Roosevelt presidency that ended with FDR’s reelection in 1936. He also searched in vain for a successor to FDR during this time, writing speeches for Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson—who lost to Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956—only to be disappointed by Stevenson’sapathy for political campaigningand lack of charisma.\n\nBut Schlesinger found who he was looking for in John F. Kennedy. Schlesinger even left a professorship at Harvard to take up a speechwriting and advisory role in the Kennedy White House in 1961 and later memorialized the experience in his 1965 book,A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House.\n\nKennedy’s assassination in November 1963 unmoored Schlesinger. Essentially the court historian of that administration, he remained loyal to the Kennedy family, particularly Robert F. Kennedy, until the latter’s own assassination in 1968. He spent the 1970s criticizing Richard Nixon’s presidency, America’s continued involvement in Vietnam, and the expansion of executive power, also detailed in his 1975 book,The Imperial Presidency. (He also advised one last Kennedy—Massachusetts Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy—during his primary challenge to President Jimmy Carter in 1980.)\n\nReagan’s ascendence provided the pretext forThe Cycles of American History. The book was typical of Schlesinger’s work—a collection of erudite essays rather than a treatise on a single theme. Schlesinger Jr. updated his father’s theory of history as a way of explaining America’s behavior as a superpower since World War II—and to, perhaps, predict its future. Reagan’s shake-up of the New Deal coalition had led Schlesinger Jr. to conclude that his father’s paradigm of “conservatism versus liberalism” obscured the complicated dynamics of American political history; so too did periodizing them in specific years. Instead, Schlesinger Jr. saw cyclical change in generational terms, in a “thirty-year alternation between public purpose and private interest.” He also applied his theory to U.S. foreign policy. No clear correlation existed between domestic and foreign policy, he argued, only that “the domestic cycle” determined the priorities of U.S. foreign policy and how the U.S. deployed power abroad—protecting private interests at home often meant securing the fortunes of corporations and the titans of capital abroad.\n\nIn the second chapter, “The Cycles of American Politics,” Schlesinger invoked his generational thesis when he argued that there was nothing exceptional about the Reagan coalition and that Reagan’s ability to attract new voters—religious fundamentalists and young Americans—simply signified a generational shift: an aging baby boomer population and voters too young to experience the radicalism of the 1960s. A lack of historical memory motivated Reagan’s campaign to “Make America Great Again.” Reagan was a corollary of the cycle working, churning as it did every generation. Schlesinger held faith that the “1980s will witness the burnout of … the age of Reagan.” Economic downturns, perennial in America history, would, he felt, discredit fealty to the private sector and Reagan-era individualism, and liberalism would experience a rebirth in the 1990s.\n\nSchlesinger held faith that the “1980s will witness the burnout of … the age of Reagan.”\n\nBut Schlesinger also recognized the significance of the times. The sociologist Daniel Bell had argued in 1960 that the Cold War birthed “the end of ideology,” since the debate over federal power had been settled. “Few serious conservatives … believe that the Welfare State is ‘the road to serfdom,’” wrote Bell. Yet ideology did in fact return with a vengeance in the 1980s, as a host of free-market, fundamentalist ideologues flocked to the Reagan coalition. The creed of individualism and rejection of the welfare state soon pervaded American politics, reshaping voters’ allegiances to both parties.\n\nWritten before Ronald Reagan developed a close relationship with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev,Cyclescritiqued the ideologues surrounding Reagan who saw this late era of the Cold War in dichotomies:Are you a Communist or not?Chapters 3 (“Foreign Policy and the American Character”), 4 (“Human Rights and the American Tradition”), and 5 (“America and Empire”) also meditated on a series of foreign policy questions that have returned to us in the age of Trump:Is the United States an empire? Does it have imperial ambitions? Should (or can) the U.S. secure and promote human rights abroad?\n\nSchlesinger saw Reagan’s foreign policy vision as part of an isolationist tradition “reincarnated as global unilateralism” that challenged the liberal vision of an international order led by the major great powers—not the U.S. alone. Further, the rejection of that vision did not signal a realignment but a “dealignment,” according to Schlesinger: The real story of American politics in the 1980s was not the Reagan revolution after all, but the decline of political parties themselves. Reforms to the presidential primary system and the resulting decline of machine politics had muted the traditional purposes of political parties. A new “electronic age” would mean a deference to personality over party, Schlesinger predicted. Reagan was the test case for this new era.\n\nFacing these headwinds, Schlesinger made a robust case for government power in an age of austerity. In his ninth chapter, “Affirmative Government and the American Economy,” Schlesinger, quoting Roosevelt, claimed that “dictatorships do not growout of strong and successful governments but out of weak and helpless ones.” When free markets dominate at the expense of civil rights, labor rights, and human rights, society unravels. Conservatives also overestimate voters’ opposition to the federal government. Only20 percent of Americanstoday have trust in the federal government, but press closely on the pulse of the public, and you will find that Americans love government programs such asSocial SecurityandMedicare, as well as interventions to protect theenvironment. The GOP cannot overlook the fact that, as Schlesinger notes, “a sizable majority approves the intervention of the state” on matters of public welfare.\n\nCutting federal programs to the predominant benefit of the rich has dire political consequences in American politics after the age of Roosevelt. “There is something distasteful … when one class calls for purification through the suffering of another class,” noted Schlesinger.\n\nBut what happens when large numbers of Americans are indifferent to that suffering? Or seek to exacerbate it?\n\nOn some matters,The Cycles of American Historyis quite prescient. While Schlesinger missed the advent of the internet, he recognized that a new age of information exchange would irrevocably disrupt American politics. As he predicted, personality matters more in American elections than it did in the early twentieth century, in no small part due to the way social media and smartphones have changed how we engage with political culture. Schlesinger even alluded to how disinformation and misinformation would shape our politics in the future. “The new media,” as he called it, has the “ability to reinforce representative democracy or to undermine it.” In the age of Trump, the latter has won out over the former, but we have the right to remain agnostic, as Schlesinger was, about how technology will shape a pluralistic democracy like the United States in the years to come.\n\nSchlesinger also accurately captured the dynamics of the modern conservative movement, even if he underestimated its staying power. Indeed, Reagan’s legacy is conspicuous. Fealty to tax cuts and to reducing the size of government persists, as does the notion that government largesse is antithetical to the interests of the nation. Reagan-era slogans also remain—“Make American Great Again” and “peace through strength.” But as the historian Nicole Hemmerhas pointed out,while Reagan was a conservative hard-liner, he was also a pragmatist who abandoned ideology when the public pushed back against his designs to cut Social Security, or when he decided tax increases were needed to address the deficit. He may have railed against “big government” rhetorically, but in practice, his ideology had limits.\n\nTrump is another matter altogether, and his second term—marked by its indiscriminate firing of longtime federal employees, shuttering of long-standing agencies, and successful plans (Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”) to cut Social Security, Medicare, SNAP benefits, and other essential programs of the American welfare state—signals that a new age of conservative ideology is here, and it is not justilliberaland revanchist but repressive and hostile to the idea of natural rights drawn from theEnlightenment.\n\nSchlesinger’s idea of cycles would position Trump as the current generation’s answer to his predecessor, Barack Obama: as the antithesis of a multiracial president who offered an affirmative vision for government’s role in Americans’ lives.The pendulum swung back.But that is too facile a characterization of what Trump has done to reshape American politics; to expose the limits of American liberalism. Schlesinger’s “cycles”—and for that matter, Schlesinger—never accounted for elements of mass society abandoning tenets of liberal democracy. He never reconciled the tension between the determinism of his theory and the agency of history to shake the foundations of the current order. He failed to imagine that the darkest parts of American history were ahead of us or, if interrupted or abated, could still return in a more frightening form.\n\nSchlesinger’s “cycles”—and for that matter, Schlesinger—never accounted for elements of mass society abandoning tenets of liberal democracy.\n\nSchlesinger’s idea of cycles focused oncontinuitiesrather thandiscontinuities;in theparlanceof historians, he was a “lumper” rather than a “splitter.” His theory worked in the twentieth century because it presumed that all Americans accepted liberalism or liberal tenets—everyone livedin the shadowof liberalism, even if they tried to avoid or repudiate it. But that is not the case anymore, not when the U.S. Marinespatrolthe streets of major cities, or when the U.S. isdisappearingpeople without due process.\n\nLiberals—Democrats—seem not to know how to meet our moment. The reflexive tendency has been for the Democratic Party leadership to do nothing but wait for Trumpism to atrophy, the assumption being that the midterm elections will (once again) rectify his dictatorial overreach. “Trump will screw up,” as New York Senator Chuck Schumersaidback in February. The pendulum will swing back.\n\nBut the urgency of our times cannot wait. Modern liberalism hasseemingly given up on the improvement ofhumankindin the twenty-firstcentury, and FDR’s vision of human progress has been subsumed by a preoccupation with “abundance” that sidelines government regulation in favor of growth. But a depreciation of government power is not an answer to the age of Trump’s vision for an autocratic yet undersupplied state. Liberals must offer a vision of the good life that rests on an activist, not absent, role for government on all levels—local, state, and federal. Americans need a revitalized age of Roosevelt to counter the age of Trump. Otherwise, we risk the perpetuation of the latter.\n\nIndeed, just because Trump will not be with us forever does not mean he will begone.Trump is a product of American history, and he will continue to live within it after he leaves office. But history is not metaphysical; it does not operate autonomously. The unmade past, a post-Trump America, is within our control. History might reveal our fate, but the present determines our future. “It takes people to make the cycle work,” wrote Schlesinger, adding, “let us not be complacent.” On this, there is good work being done, and much still to do.",

    "News_title":"Your Brain's Youthfulness (or Lack of It) Could Predict How Long You Live",
    "News_text":"We celebrate our birthdays on the same day each year, but the truth is that different parts of our bodies are agingat different speeds. New research suggests brain age could be a strong predictor for lifespan.\n\nThis comes from a team from Stanford University, who applied a blood analysis technique on records of 44,498 individuals in a UK health research database, aged between 40 and 70 years old. The analysis gave them an estimated biological age for 11 key organs in the body, including the brain.\n\nThese organ ages were then compared against the health records of the participants, for up to 17 years. Generally, the more 'aged' organs a participant had, the higher their risk of dying within the follow-up period.\n\nRelated:Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds\n\nIf one organ had to be chosen as the best single representative, it would be the brain: the data showed that people with a younger brain age tended to have alonger lifespan.\n\n\"The brain is the gatekeeper of longevity,\"saysneuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, from Stanford University.\n\n\"If you've got an old brain, you have an increased likelihood of mortality. If you've got a young brain, you're probably going to live longer.\"\n\nThe blood test used here works by measuring protein levels, and matching those proteins to the organs that produce them. Through some complex calculations, this indicates how welleach organ is functioning– whether they're working more like a brand new, souped-up sports car, or a dilapidated old vehicle on the verge of collapse.\n\nAs you might expect, the older an organ was – essentially, the more wear and tear indicated by its proteins – the more likely the chances of disease in that organ. The greater the number of 'elderly' organs, the greater the likelihood of disease or anearly death.\n\nIt was the brain stats that really stood out though. People with \"extremely aged\" brains (in the top 7 percent in terms of old age) were almost twice as likely to die over a 15-year period, compared to those whose biological brain ages were more in line with their chronological age.\n\nThose with \"extremely youthful\" brains had a 40 percent lower risk of dying within the study period.\n\nThere were other interesting associations too:Alzheimer'sdisease was around 3.1 times more likely in extremely aged brains compared to normally aged brains. Extremely youthful brains, meanwhile, were 74 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's than those closer to chronological age.\n\nWe know that a whole host of factors combine to increase or decrease our chances of dying or developing diseases, and previous studies have shown thatpoverty,obesity, andphysical activitymight all have an impact on brain aging.\n\nAnd brain aging is just one variable linked to lifespan – everything from how carefully you cross the road to your eating habits adds up to determine how longyou're going to live, so we can't say brain aging is the direct cause here. What's more, there's likely to be two-way feedback here, with disease also contributing to organ aging.\n\nHowever, it's important to understand which variables can make the most difference, and to get as full a picture as possible of the contributors to disease and mortality, in order to maximize our chances ofaging healthily.\n\n\"This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people,\"saysWyss-Coray.\n\n\"The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases.\"\n\nThe research has been published inNature Medicine.\n\nThis Foot Scan Could Stop Your Small Cut From Costing You a Limb\n\nHere's Why Weather Can Trigger Your Migraines, And How to Ease The Pain\n\nA Simple Daily Habit Could Help Lower Your Blood Pressure",

    "News_text":"“With every passing month, the gap grows. Our knowledge deepens. Our target sets expand. Your options narrow,” Gallant wrote.\n\nFormer defense minister Yoav Gallant sent Iranian Supreme Leader AliKhameneia letter urging him to abandon his war against Israel on Thursday.\n\n“We have never met, but I trust we know a great deal about one another,” Gallant began, explaining that he had watched Khamenei for nearly 30 years as he rose to power.\n\n“As defense minister, I was responsible for turning decades of Israeli intelligence, air force capabilities, and strategic doctrine into a single, coordinated military plan. The plan that cut through your 'Ring of Fire' like a hot knife through butter and ultimately caused it to collapse,” he said.\n\nAccording to Gallant, the plans he created as defense minister culminated inOperation Rising Lion.\n\n“What unfolded in June 2025 was not merely a military campaign. It was the strategic collapse of a system you spent four decades constructing.”\n\nGallant wrote that despite the regime’s attempts to create a “Ring of Fire” around Israel - Hamas to the south, Hezbollah to the north, Syria and Iraq to the east, and Houthis to the southeast - they failed.\n\n“The Israeli public, despite pain and loss, did not break. Our people endured. As you are now well aware, we responded,” he said, detailing the sequence of events that followed October 7 leading up to the Israel-Iran war.\n\n“Israel systematically dismantled Hamas leadership, Hezbollah arsenals and command, and missile production facilities. We flew over Tehran as we did over Tel Aviv. We eliminated key military leaders and scientists. We struck the S300 systems. We eviscerated your air defense. Your nuclear program and infrastructure were set back by years. Your shield, long advertised, failed to protect.”\n\nIn Gallant’s words, what mattered more than the physical damage dealt was the intelligence Israel gained.\n\n“We see everything. We hear everything. We are everywhere,” he wrote.\n\n“We knew your schedules. Your sites. Your communications. Your conversations with your closest allies, most of whom are no longer with you, in Beirut, Damascus, and Tehran. Your timelines. Your fallback plans. And your blind spots. In more ways than one, we knew more about you than you knew about yourselves.”\n\nGallant warned Khamenei that Iran would never be able to pursue nuclear weapons, and to do so would be to put his faith in systems that have already failed.\n\n“Hope is not a strategy. Would you risk your future and your country's on a race you cannot conceal and are unlikely to finish?”\n\nGallant reminded Khamenei that sinceOctober 7, Israel had succeeded in killing many of the regime’s top players.\n\n“Hezbollah’s arsenal lies in ruins, buried with its commanders.Hamasis neutralized. Assad is gone. His successor has chosen a different path. The Gulf states now align against you, not with you. Iraq resists your grip. The region has moved on.”\n\nTo close his letter, Gallant told Khamenei he could not rebuild his proxies or nuclear program without Israel destroying them as many times as necessary.\n\n“But what you build, we will likely see. What we see, we will strike. And what we strike, you will struggle to replace,” he said.\n\n“With every passing month, the gap grows. Our knowledge deepens. Our target sets expand. Your options narrow.”\n\nGallant issued a final warning: Abandon the war, or face Israel again.\n\nHe laid out the “defining moment” Khamenei faces, saying the regime could continue to pursue nuclear weapons, and pay the “heavy price” that Israel would demand, or they could move forward.\n\n“Abandon your war against a small, determined country a thousand miles from your border, and focus instead on the welfare and future of your own people.”\n\n“But if you choose wrong again, we will be there, waiting,” Gallant concluded.",

    "News_title":"A Blueprint for Redistributing AI’s Profits",
    "News_text":"Credit - Getty Images\n\nWelcome back toIn the Loop, TIME’s new twice-weekly newsletter about the world of AI. We're publishing installments both as stories on Time.com and as emails.\n\nIf you're reading this in your browser, you cansubscribeto have the next one delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nLet’s say, sometime in the next few years, artificial intelligence automates most of the jobs that humans currently do. If that happens, how can we avoid societal collapse? This question, once the stuff of science fiction, is now very real.\n\nIn May, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs in the next one to five years, and send unemployment rising to up to 20%. In response to such a prediction, you might expect states to begin seriously drawing up contingency plans. Not so. But a growing group of academic economistsareworking on this question. A newpaper, published this Tuesday, suggests a novel way for states to protect their populations in a world of mass AI-enabled job loss.\n\nSovereign wealth funds— The paper recommends that states invest in AI-related industries via sovereign wealth funds, the same type of financial vehicles that have allowed the likes of Norway and the United Arab Emirates to diversify their oil wealth. This isn’t strictly a new idea. In fact, the UAE has already been investing billions of dollars from its sovereign wealth funds into AI. Nvidia, the semiconductor company, has been urging states to invest in “sovereign AI” for years now. But unlike those examples, which are focused on yielding as big a return on investment as possible, or exerting geopolitical influence over AI, the paper lays out the social reasons that this might be a good idea.\n\nAI welfare state —The paper argues that if transformative AI is around the corner, the ability of states to economically provide for their citizens may be directly tied to how exposed they are to AI’s upside. “Such investments can be seen as part of the state’s responsibility to safeguard public welfare in the face of disruptive technological change,” the paper argues. The returns on investment could be used to fund universal basic income, or a “stabilization fund” that could allow states to “absorb shocks, redistribute benefits, and support displaced workers in real time.”\n\nReasons to be skeptical— To be sure, this approach has risks. States investing billions in AI could paradoxically accelerate the very job-automation trends that they’re seeking to mitigate. On the flipside, if AI turns out to be less transformative than expected, piling in at the top of the market could bring losses. And just like retail investing, any potential upside is correlated with how much money you have available in the first place. Rich countries will have the opportunity to become richer; poor countries will struggle to participate at all. “As [transformative AI]-generated wealth risks deepening global inequality, it may also be necessary to explore new models for transnational benefit-sharing,” the paper notes, “including internationally coordinated sovereign investment vehicles that allocate a portion of AI-derived returns toward global public goods.”\n\nPerson in the news–Elon Musk, owner of xAI\n\nLate Wednesday night, with the launch of Grok 4, the AI race got a new leader: Elon Musk. At least, that’s if you believe the benchmarks, which show Grok trouncing competition from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic on some of the industry’s most difficult tests. On ARC AGI 2, a benchmark designed to be easy for humans but difficult for AIs, Grok 4’s reasoning mode scored 16.2%—nearly double that of its closest contender (Claude Opus 4 by Anthropic).\n\nUnexpected result— Musk’s xAI has not traditionally been seen as a “frontier” AI company, despite its huge cache of GPU chips. Previous releases of Grok delivered middling performance. And just a day before Grok 4’s release, an earlier version of the chatbot had a meltdown on X, repeatedly referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and sharing violent rape fantasies. (The posts were later deleted.) Episodes like this had encouraged hopes, in at least some corners of the AI world, that the far-right billionaire’s attempts to make his bot more “truth-seeking” were actually making it more stupid.\n\nMusk on Grok and AGI— On a livestream broadcast on X on Wednesday night, Musk said Grok 4 had been trained using 10 times as much computing power as Grok 3. “With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions,” he said. On the subject of artificial general intelligence, he said: \"Will this be bad or good for humanity? I think it'll be good. Most likely it'll be good. But I've somewhat reconciled myself to the fact that even if it wasn't gonna be good, I'd at least like to be alive to see it happen.\"\n\nWhat Musk does best— If Grok 4’s benchmark scores are borne out, it would mean that Musk’s core skill — spinning up cracked engineering teams that are blindly focused on a single goal — is applicable to the world of AI. That will worry those in the industry who care about not just developing AI quickly, but also doing so safely. As the MechaHitler debacle showed, neither Musk nor anybody else yet knows how to prevent current AI systems from going badly out of control. “If you can’t prevent your AI from endorsing Hitler,” says expert forecaster Peter Wildeford, “how can we trust you with ensuring far more complex future AGI can be deployed safely?”\n\nWhere is AI? Last year, Iwroteabout a group of researchers who had attempted to answer that question. Now, the team at Epoch AI have gone one step further: they’ve built aninteractive mapof more than 500 AI supercomputers, to track exactly where the world’s major AI infrastructure is located. The map confirms what I wrote last year: AI compute is concentrated in rich countries, with the vast majority in the US and China, followed by Europe and the Persian Gulf.\n\nAs always, if you have an interesting story of AI in Action, we’d love to hear it. Email us at: intheloop@time.com\n\nThey Asked an A.I. Chatbot Questions. The Answers Sent Them Spiralingby Kashmir Hill in theNew York Times\n\nLarge language models are mysterious, shapeshifting artifacts.

    "News_title":"Opinion - The end of birthright citizenship could be an opportunity for Puerto Rican independence",
    "News_text":"The recentSupreme Court decisionleaving open the possibility that President Trump’s denial of birthright citizenship to individuals born on U.S. soil to undocumented parents will be upheld, is sending shockwaves through legal, political, and immigrant communities.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor’sdissentcaptured the alarm: “No right is safe.”\n\nBut beyond the continental United States, this decision reverberates in a unique and profound way in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory caught in political limbo since 1898.\n\nFor more than a century, Puerto Ricans have held U.S. citizenship by statute, not by constitutional guarantee. That statute — theJones-Shafroth Act of 1917— unilaterally imposed U.S. citizenship on Puerto Ricans (without their consent) not as a recognition of full inclusion, but as a tool of colonial control.\n\nToday, that statutory citizenship is proving to be as vulnerable as its colonial origins. The Supreme Court’s ruling now opens a wider conversation: If U.S. citizenship can be restricted or redefined by federal authorities, what future do Puerto Ricans really have within the U.S. system?\n\nNot much.\n\nThe ruling has already been weaponized by the pro-statehood movement in Puerto Rico. Statehood advocates argue that only by becoming a state can Puerto Ricans ensure permanent, constitutionally protected birthright citizenship for future generations. But this narrow, fear-based response ignores both legal precedent and geopolitical logic.\n\nThere is a better way — one rooted in dignity, sovereignty and international norms. Puerto Rico can and should become a sovereign nation, either under independence or a Compact of Free Association. In fact, the ruling strengthens the case for independence as the most just and stable long-term solution for Puerto Rico and the U.S. alike.\n\nUnder thedraft executive orderrecently proposed for Trump’s consideration, Puerto Rico would become a sovereign nation. Upon independence, the statutory U.S. citizenship conferred by the Jones Act would cease to apply to new births in Puerto Rico.\n\nAll individuals born in Puerto Rico after independence would acquire Puerto Rican citizenship — a national identity of their own, defined by Puerto Rican law and values, not those of a distant foreign power.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the complete severing of U.S. ties for individuals. Children born in Puerto Rico to U.S. citizen parents (as defined under the Immigration and Nationality Act) would remain eligible for U.S. citizenship through a Consular Report of Birth Abroad — a system already in place for U.S. citizens worldwide.\n\nFor example, if a U.S. citizen has a baby in Paris, that child can obtain U.S. citizenship. This preserves continuity for families with U.S. roots, while respecting the sovereignty of Puerto Rico to determine its own citizenship policy moving forward.\n\nMoreover, Puerto Ricans who already possess U.S. citizenship at the moment of independence would retain it, and automatically acquire Puerto Rican citizenship as well, becoming dual citizens.\n\nThose who no longer wish to hold U.S. citizenship would have the option to renounce it swiftly and without penalty through the new U.S. Embassy in San Juan, under a fast-track renunciation process that respects personal identity and freedom of choice.\n\nPuerto Rico’s pro-statehood movement seldom mentions the economic costs of statehood. Under current law, most Puerto Ricans do not pay U.S. federal income tax on locally sourced income. This tax exemption would end under statehood, and the consequences would be economically devastating.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office warned ina 2014 reportthat full application of federal tax laws could collapse Puerto Rico’s fragile economy. Under independence, Puerto Rican citizens would remain exempt from U.S. federal taxes unless they reside in the U.S., as is standard for all foreign nationals.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Republic of Puerto Rico would design and implement its own national tax system based on its unique economic needs and priorities.\n\nA sovereign Puerto Rico should and would still remain interconnected with the U.S. A free-transit agreement — allowing visa-free travel between the two nations for both U.S. and Puerto Rican citizens — would enable family unity, tourism, trade and opportunities without requiring assimilation or dependence.\n\nIn fact, this clarity of status would help Puerto Ricans make informed decisions about their identity and future.\n\nThose who feel primarily American and wish to maintain birthright U.S. citizenship for their children could relocate to any state in the U.S. Those who feel primarily Puerto Rican and seek to maintain their national culture, identity, and Spanish language — would finally live in a nation where their citizenship reflects their culture, language, and aspirations.\n\nImportantly, independence would also halt the practice of foreigners giving birth in Puerto Rico solely to acquire U.S. citizenship for their children — often with no intention of integrating into Puerto Rican society.\n\nSovereignty would give Puerto Rico the authority to define and defend its own naturalization and immigration policies, protecting both its demographic and cultural integrity.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has unwittingly accelerated a long-overdue reckoning.\n\nIf U.S. citizenship for Puerto Ricans is no longer secure, then neither is the colonial-style arrangement that produced it. Rather than cling to an uncertain future within a union that has never truly welcomed them, Puerto Ricans now face a historic opportunity to define themselves on their own terms.\n\nIndependence does not mean isolation, but unity with the global community of nations. It means liberty with dignity, citizenship with identity and a relationship with the United States based on respect,not colonial subordination.\n\nThe end of birthright U.S. citizenship in Puerto Rico could be, paradoxically, the beginning of Puerto Rican nationhood. The path forward is clear for those who believe in justice, democracy and decolonization.\n\nPuerto Rico must become a sovereign nation — not just for legal reasons, but for the dignity of its people and the fulfillment of its historical destiny.\n\nJavier A.

    "News_title":"Recent college graduates face a new obstacle in finding a job: AI",
    "News_text":"The rise of generative AI is making it harder for recent college graduates to get a foothold on the corporate ladder as they start their careers.\n\nJob listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to young grads have declined 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged 30%, according to data from Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z workers.\n\nAlthough people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, \"there are early warning signs\" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced  workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\n\"The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,\" he said.\n\nAs of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time,accordingto the New York Federal Reserve.\n\nTo be sure, most recent college grads are finding work, Calidas emphasized, adding that the latest job figures point to a \"deterioration,\" not a collapse, in opportunities for young people.\n\nStill, \"It's tough for students who feel like they have done the right thing their whole lives — they went into STEM careers or computer science because they expected software hiring to grow and grow, and that may not happen,\" he said.\n\nJust ask Michael Macaluso, 22, who this year earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut. Despite applying for roughly 200 positions, he has yet to land a job in his chosen field. For now, he's working as an assistant pool director at the Lake Isle Country Club in Eastchester, New York, his hometown.\n\n\"I was told by a lot of people, that I was going to get a job right out of college,\" he told CBS News' Ali Bauman. \"And then all of a sudden, there's no jobs.\"\n\nAI redefining the entry-level job\n\nExperts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change.\n\n\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"\n\nOver the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.\n\nLiya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024studyby researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.\n\n\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.\n\nBy contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.\n\n\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a  higher skill level.\"\n\nNew technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.\n\nThe acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.\n\n\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"\n\nSen.

    "News_text":"Ecuador’s most notorious drug kingpin is headed to the United States.\n\nJose Adolfo Macías, better known as “Fito,” agreed Friday to be extradited from Ecuador to the US, where he is wanted by the US Justice Department on charges of drug and weapons trafficking.\n\nThe head of the criminal organization Los Choneros accepted his extradition during a hearing at the National Court of Justice.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Alexei Schacht, Macías’s attorney in the US, said that his client agreed to be extradited on the advice of his Ecuadorean lawyer.\n\n“We are working hard to defend his rights and help him and his family,” Schact said. “Mr. Macías and his entire legal team are working hard to obtain the best possible outcome for him.”\n\nMacías escape from prison in January 2024 plunged Ecuador into chaos. Soon after, gunmen stormed a popular TV station and held the crew hostage live on the air.\n\nEcuadorian President Daniel Noboa, who had taken office shortly before Macías’s escape, declared a state of “internal armed conflict” within Ecuador and designated Los Choneros and 21 other gangs as terrorist organizations.\n\nMacías is the only founding member of Los Choneros believed to be alive. Little is known about his life before he entered the criminal underworld, but after over a decade in prison, he garnered a reputation as the gang’s money-laundering expert.\n\nMacías’ 2024 prison break revealed that he enjoyed numerous luxuries in prison. He was treated to fireworks displays for his birthday, according to footage from CNN affiliate Ecuavisa. One military source told CNN that Macías had arranged to have his cell doubled in size, and that he had entertained several female guests while imprisoned.\n\nHe was captured last month after over a year in hiding, in circumstances not unlike those he’d enjoyed while imprisoned. Authorities found him in an underground bunker by a mansion in Manabí province. The villa was equipped with a home gym, marble walls and a game room, among other amenities.\n\nSurveillance flights over the property detected an irregular field behind the house.\n\n“They started to excavate,” Ecuador’s Interior Minister John Reimberg recalled soon after. “As soon as this happened, Fito panicked because if we continued, the roof of his bunker would collapse. At that moment, he opened the hatch, where the military was already located, and climbed out of the hole where he was hiding. That’s how we detained him.”\n\nNoboa announced soon afterwards that he intended on having Macías extradited to face justice in the US.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account atCNN.com",

    "News_title":"Why Your Morning Coffee Costs More—and What You Can Do About It",
    "News_text":"Chalermchonchan Chanporn\/Getty Images\n\nClimate change is impacting coffee yields and increasing prices, causing concern for consumers and growers.\n\nRegenerative farming and techniques like composting can help lower costs and boost quality.\n\nConsumers can help by buying certified sustainable coffee and supporting environmentally conscious brands.\n\nAndrea Illy, Chairman of the Italian coffee brandIlly, sipped a cappuccino at a recent breakfast in Manhattan and discussed the state of the Western Hemisphere’s favorite morning drink. \"Now we have severely high coffee prices as a consequence of droughts last year in Vietnam and Brazil triggered by El Niño, the ocean current that goes back and forth across the South Pacific,\" he explained.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña are two climate patterns. El Niño years bring warmer water and temperatures, but they trade off with cooler La Niña periods. Climate change has strengthened El Niño’s influence and expanded it, even to Atlantic locations like Brazil. That’s led to more droughts, which have decreased yields, driving up the cost of the green coffee that goes to roasters by nearly 55 percent—the most precipitous increase in half a century.\n\n\"Of course, the consumer pays the bill,\" says Illy. In May, U.S. consumers spent an average of $7.93 per pound for roasted coffee, up $1.77 since 2023. \"Coffee growers are unhappy with such a high price, too, because they say it’s unsustainable. Consumption will go down, and the price will collapse.\"\n\nGrowers attempt to ride the boom by planting more trees, increasing production. \"Then, the year after, the market is flooded with coffee, and the prices go down like a rock,\" says Illy. It’s a typical trend. \"We keep doing the same mistakes.\"\n\nCoffee trees—particularly Arabica, the main species—are highly susceptible to climate pressures. As the planet warms, estimates are that, by 2050, half as much land will be suitable for coffee. Growers will need to move higher in altitude. And diseases like coffee leaf rust, a fungus that’s decimated plants in every coffee-producing region around the world, will proliferate. Given that many farmers have few resources, we are looking at an uncertain future for our cups of joe.\n\nLuckily, solutions are in the works. Coffee importers, researchers, advocates and governments are cooperating to support farmers. And consumers can help.\n\nCoffee is farmed by a vast collection of small landholders in 70 countries across the Southern Hemisphere. Ninety-five percent of the 12.5 million coffee farms are less than five hectares, or 12 acres, in size. Sixty percent of the world’s coffee comes from small farms—yet it’s only in Vietnam and Brazil, where larger holdings are more common, that farmers earn enough to escape poverty.\n\nThat’s a social and environmental crisis. \"Farmers living below the poverty line are often unable to withstand climate shocks,\" sayTran Quynh Chi, regional landscapes director for Asia, andMette-Marie Hansen, senior program manager for coffee, for the sustainable farming advocacy organization IDH, who answered questions together for this story. \"Farmers struggling to survive often turn to unsustainable land expansion, clearing forests to grow more coffee or other crops.\"\n\nDeforestation degrades habitats, causes biodiversity loss and contributes to the climate change that is harming coffee in the first place. There are 12 million hectares (almost 30 million acres) of coffee in production worldwide—but compared to, say, soybeans, which are grown on nearly three times the land in the United States alone, coffee is a relatively small crop, so it causes less damage.\n\nStill, saysRaina Lang, Conservation International’s senior director for sustainable coffee, \"it’s more like death by a thousand cuts. When prices are high and farmers see profit, they expand. When productivity is low, instead of working to increase their yield, they increase growing area to offset that loss.\"\n\nBoth tactics lead to deforestation. That’s one reason Conservation International is collaborating with the United Nations’ Green Climate Fund to promote sustainable growing practices in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Uganda, where 20 percent of small coffee farmers reside. The organization is training farmers to increase productivity on their existing land through sustainable practices. It has also created the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, partnering with roasters and large retailers (such as Aldi and Dunkin’) that pledge to buy only sustainable, responsibly sourced coffee, and also with research and tech partners committed to helping farmers increase profits in earth-friendly ways. The water-smart company Irrigation Technologies, for instance, provides coffee growers with its Deep Root Irrigation technology, saving them 60 percent of the water used by standard drip irrigation systems.\n\nOther NGOs are doing the same. In Uganda, IDH’s Coffee Farmer Income Resilience Programme provides growers with World Bank–financed training to adopt regenerative practices, including adding fruit trees, row crops and apiaries. Growing other crops, say Chi and Hansen, can boost farmers’ income by 10 percent. And through its Initiative for Sustainable Landscapes (ISLA) program, IDH is helping farmers in Kenya and Vietnam transition to organic fertilizers, adopt rainwater catchment, manage cover crops for compost and soil health and recycle leftover coffee husks for mulch. These programs can not only increase profitability through alternative income streams but also improve the health and resilience of coffee farms.\n\nCoffee brands are pitching in, as well. One such player is Illy, which is training growers inregenerative agriculture. Farmers feed the microorganisms in the soil with compost, creating soil biodiversity that fends off diseases, holds moisture and sequesters the carbon that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Farmers forgo chemicals and save money and emissions they would otherwise expend on ploughing. Illy reports that 90 percent of the company’s growers have adopted 70 percent of the regenerative practices honed on its research farms. The result? \"Productivity is higher with cheaper production costs.\" Beneficial insects and birds that eat agricultural pests thrive. \"And the coffee is so much better.\"\n\nYet, all these efforts won’t make a dent unless farmers can earn a real living. As Chi and Hansen point out, \"When there is lack of income security, even the most well-designed sustainability programs risk failure.\" IDH, therefore, is working to keep more money in farmers’ hands. Coffee's annual market value is $200 billion, reports Illy, but farmers only see 5% of that. IDH, therefore, is working to increase farmers' profits, providing technical and financial support for regenerative agriculture, which helps them lower production costs, secure premium prices and stabilize markets.\n\nAnother issue has been a lack of investment in the trees that produce coffee berries. That’s particularly problematic under climate change. \"Coffee is under-innovated,\" saysHanna Neuschwander, senior communications advisor at World Coffee Research. \"The number of apple varieties registered in the International Register of Varieties is over 5,000 since 1990, and for coffee it’s 120.\"\n\nMost coffee varieties were created in a breeding push after coffee leaf rust arrived in the Americas in the 1970s, but by now, those varieties have lost their ability to resist the mutating pathogen. World Coffee Research has thousands of varieties of coffee trees in trials. Four have made it into real-world trials in Guatemala, Peru and Costa Rica. Its first trees go to market in 2027, and Neuschwander is optimistic: \"Human history is full of examples of running into a problem and innovating a solution. That’s the business we’re in.\"\n\nBut research and development takes money. More than 200 coffee companies—including Starbucks, Intelligentsia, Keurig and Dr Pepper—subsidize World Coffee Research. Other efforts rely on government funding, and in the U.S., funding has been uncertain of late. For instance, many of Conservation International’s NGO partners were funded by the USDA or USAID. \"That programming has stopped,\" Lang says. \"I’m sure that we’ll see impacts. A lot of the US investments in Central America were to improve livelihoods with the hope that farmers wouldn’t immigrate.\" Indeed, sources report that the main driver of immigration from Central America since the first Trump term has been climate change, which has devastated coffee and other crops, leading farmers to seek a living up north.\n\nOther governments have taken the opposite approach. They are working to improve coffee sustainability. The European Union, for instance, recently moved to require deforestation-free sourcing for seven products, including coffee.\n\nExperts agree that consumers can help secure the crop for future coffee breaks. Conservation International’s Sustainable Coffee Challenge website lists roasters and retailers that source sustainable coffee. Though Lang says, “the easiest thing to do is look for a certification on a bag of coffee. While no certification is perfect, it is a sourcing strategy to promote best practices in environmental and social stewardship.”Fairtrade,Rainforest Alliance,Regenerative OrganicandRegenagri, which certifies Illy, all use third-party auditing to ensure that production meets their standards. You may pay more for certified beans, but you’ll be helping farmers reinvest, protect the environment and secure their livelihoods, say Chi and Hansen.\n\nIndeed, farmers who grow beans under certification programs earn more. For example, no matter what’s happening on the New York futures market (in which agreements are made to purchase coffee at a set price on a set future date), Fairtrade shelters farmers from fluctuations on the low end of the market by guaranteeing a minimum price for coffee sold to buyers under its certification program. That currently ranges from $1.80 for washed Arabica to $1.20 for natural Robusta.\n\nOn top of that, buyers pay a 20-cent Fairtrade premium, at least 25 percent of which farmers must use on infrastructure and social projects. If their coffee is also certified organic, they receive an additional 40 cents per pound. If the price for coffee on the commodities market ranges higher than the minimum, buyers pay the commodity price, and farmers still receive their premiums. In 2018 alone, says Fairtrade, farmers earned close to $89 million in Fairtrade premiums that were reinvested in farms and communities.\n\nMore broadly, says Illy, consumers can call for an economic system that recognizes the value of nature. \"The extractive, linear system that we created with the Industrial Revolution depletes natural resources,\" a process he says is self-destructive because we rely on those resources to live. \"A regenerative economy puts natural capital at the same level as financial capital. As the regenerative economy grows, you regenerate natural capital.\"\n\nThat mug in your hand is not just a caffeine fix; it can also drive a system that adequately compensates farmers and protects the environment, which in turn helps mitigate climate change, ensuring there’s coffee in the future. The immediate benefit to you? A more delicious cup and the gratification of supporting its producers.\n\nThe coffee industry has been affected by climate change, economic inequality and outdated farming methods. The dwindling coffee harvests have caused an increase in prices. And while consumers are paying higher prices, the coffee farmers are struggling. Organizations like IDH and Conservation International are implementing sustainable and regenerative farming practices to try to improve yields and assist farmers. Similarly, organizations like World Coffee Research are working to develop better coffee hybrids, but are facing setbacks due to funding cuts. Consumers can help protect and support the future of the coffee industry by choosing certified sustainable brands and companies that source ethically.\n\nRead the original article onEATINGWELL",

Though its offerings are largely commoditized, the company has built a strong competitive edge through nationwide regional manufacturing centers that allow for rapid delivery, giving contractors logistical efficiency and eliminating the need for large on-site inventories. This operational advantage allows Atkore to charge a 5–10% premium and maintain a loyal customer base.\n\nThe company saw outsized gains during COVID, with supply chain disruptions and surging construction demand pushing 2022 revenue and EBITDA to 2x and 4x pre-COVID levels, respectively. However, since then, prices for key products like PVC and metal conduits have dropped due to an influx of international supply, leading to a 30% drop in revenue and a 50% decline in EBITDA by 2024.\n\nDespite this, management sees signs that the worst is over, citing the classic cobweb effect—surplus supply is likely to exit the market as margins collapse, aided by rising tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Meanwhile, Atkore continues to grow volumes, retain customers, and invest in higher-growth verticals like HDPE, cable management, water conduits, and solar torque tubing, while also benefiting from U.S. government broadband and infrastructure spending.\n\nWith capex mostly complete, future cash flow is set to be returned to shareholders. Atkore remains profitable with a strong balance sheet and trades at attractive valuation multiples, suggesting downside is limited.

Rob Bresnahan Jr. — supported the legislation.\n\nBresnahan, R-Dallas Township, and Meuser, R-Dallas, issued statements after the vote was tallied.\n\n\"This bill delivers on the promise I made to the people of Northeastern Pennsylvania by providing the largest working-class tax cuts in American history, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, and securing the southern border,\" Bresnahan said. \"We also protect and strengthen Medicaid by cracking down on the fraud, waste, and abuse that is driving the program toward collapse. This ensures Medicaid is there for seniors, people with disabilities, and vulnerable families, not for those who can work but refuse to do so.\"\n\n\"Most importantly, we worked directly with the White House to ensure all our hospitals in Northeastern Pennsylvania will qualify for the funding they need to stay open and protect critical healthcare access for our communities,\" he added.\n\nMeuser said the One Big Beautiful Bill is a direct response to what the American people have demanded — secure borders, lower costs, greater opportunity and an accountable government that works for them, not against them.\n\n\"This bill makes permanent the tax relief passed in President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and prevents the largest tax increase in American history,\" he said. \"If Congress did not pass the OBBB, we'd be guaranteeing a $4 trillion tax hike on the American people — raising taxes on 165 million taxpayers and over 33 million small businesses.\"\n\nMeuser said for families in Pennsylvania, the bill's passage means avoiding a $2,500 tax hike, preserving the full $30,000 standard deduction and expanding the Child Tax Credit to $2,200 for 1.4 million Pennsylvania households.\n\nMeuser said the OBBB supports working families in every corner of the country.\n\n\"It eliminates taxes on tips and overtime through 2028, creates a $6,000 senior deduction, and launches Trump Investment Accounts for every child born between 2025 and 2028 — giving families a stake in our nation's economic future from day one,\" Rep. Meuser said. \"As well, it secures our border by completing the physical barrier, expanding personnel, and giving ICE and Border Patrol the resources they need to do their job. It unleashes American energy by ending costly mandates, repealing wasteful subsidies, restarting lease sales, and restarting domestic production. And it puts our budget on a more sustainable path — delivering $1.2 trillion in mandatory savings, the largest deficit reduction package in nearly 30 years.\"\n\nMeuser went on to say, \"And importantly, this bill strengthens Medicaid for those it was intended to support. It includes common-sense work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, removes individuals who are ineligible under the law from the rolls, and, beginning in October 2026, it ends the federal cost-share for states that choose to include illegal immigrants in their Medicaid programs — taking serious steps to address waste, fraud, and abuse in the program.\"\n\nMeuser also said the legislation also delivers support for rural health care, creating a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care.\n\nDemocrats disagree\n\nFollowing passage of the bill, Suzan DelBene, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair, said the bill \"rips away health care and food access from millions of children and families — all to pay for massive tax breaks for their billionaire campaign donors.\"\n\n\"This Big, Ugly Bill is a laundry list of Republicans' betrayal to the American people,\" she said. \"The DCCC will make sure every battleground voter knows how vulnerable House Republicans — including Mackenzie, Bresnahan, and Perry — abandoned them by passing the most unpopular piece of legislation in modern American history, and we're going to take back the House majority because of it.\"\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro also critcized the bill, saying he wanted to be clear that it would have devastating impacts on Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to the Governor's fact sheet, 310,000 would lose Medicaid coverage, while 144,000 Pennsylvanians on SNAP risk losing access to food assistance statewide.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\nPA 8th Congressional District — Rep. Rob Bresnahan\n\n—21,637 Pennsylvanians will lose Medicaid coverage.\n\n—11,572 Pennsylvanians will lose SNAP benefits.\n\nPA 9th Congressional District — Rep. Dan Meuser\n\n—17,967 Pennsylvanians will lose Medicaid coverage.\n\n—8,185 Pennsylvanians will lose SNAP benefits.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pittsburgh, also spoke out against the \"Big Ugly Bill,\" saying it will hurt Pennsylvania. Deluzio emphasized how it slashes healthcare for millions of hardworking Americans while giving tax handouts to the ultra rich — calling it \"class warfare\" and \"fiscally reckless.\"",

    "News_text":"NEW YORK (PIX11) — Eyes have been drawn to federal immigration courts followingBrad Lander’s arrestin June while accompanying a person out of the courtroom.\n\nICE opposers have banded together to observe and report on what transpires inside and outside of those immigration courtrooms. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined PIX11 Morning News to shed light on what advocates have seen.\n\nMore Local News\n\nWilliams said that immigrants would hear from the judge handling their cases that they were being dismissed, not knowing that meant they were now eligible for deportation.\n\n“They were being tricked, essentially,” Williams said. “It is heartbreaking.”\n\nWilliams said what is happening now is somehow worse. According to Williams, judges would grant immigrants extended time, sometimes months, to speak with an attorney and collect all necessary documents and information regarding their case.\n\nUntil they would exit the courtroom and find a multitude of ICE agents waiting for them in the hallways.\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\n“Depending on which floor, you could see 10, 15, 20 [agents] — just lining the hallways,” Williams said. “Most of them masked, some of them not properly identifiable.”\n\nWilliams said he witnessed immigrants collapse to the floor in fear when they were met by agents.\n\n“To see someone relieved in the courtroom, to the shock when they come out, it was hard to see,” he said. Williams referenced one instance when a 5-year-old girl came out and asked where her dad was.\n\nThe people Williams and others watch over are, according to him, going through the court system as asylum seekers in a legal manner, but are being treated as criminals.\n\n“They’re doing the check-ins that they’re being asked to do, and then just being abducted,” Williams said. “It’s a horrific experience to see these families torn apart.”\n\nHe said that when he was there for one hour, he witnessed five or six instances of people being taken by agents. “You see agents waiting by the door. That usually means whoever is coming out, they’re about to take.”\n\nWilliams said the way to help is to join in the effort of court-watching.

    "News_title":"Floods are swallowing their village. But for them and others, the EPA has cut the lifeline.",
    "News_text":"In the Alaska village of Kipnuk, 4 miles from the Bering Sea, erosion is rapidly eating away the banks of the Kugkaktlik River. The tribal village was awarded a $20 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant — money that it intended to use for erosion control. But that grant was canceled in May. (Photo courtesy of the Native Village of Kipnuk)\n\nThis story was originally published by Floodlight.\n\nAcre by acre, the village of Kipnuk is falling into the river.\n\nThe small Alaskan tribal village sits on permafrost, which is thawing fast as global temperatures rise. That’s left the banks of the Kugkaktlik River unstable — and more likely to collapse when floods hit, as they often do. Buildings, boardwalks, wind turbines and other critical infrastructure are at risk, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director.\n\nSo when the village learned late last year that it had been awarded a $20 million federal grant to protect the riverbank, tribal members breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nBut that relief was short-lived. On May 2, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the grant. Without that help, Paul says, residents may be forced to relocate their village.\n\n“In the future, so much land will be in the river,” Paul says.\n\nKipnuk’s grant was one of more than 600 that the EPA has canceled since President Donald Trump took office, according to data obtained byFloodlightthrough a Freedom of Information Act request. Through May 15, the cuts totaled more than $2.7 billion.\n\nFloodlight’sanalysis of the data shows:\n\nEnvironmental justice grantstook by far the biggest hit, with more than $2.4 billion in funding wiped out.\n\nThe EPA has also canceled more than $120 million in grants aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of cement, concrete and other construction materials.Floodlight reportedin April that the cement industry’s carbon emissions rival those of some major countries — and that efforts to decarbonize the industry have lost momentum under the Trump administration.\n\nBlue states bore the brunt. Those states lost nearly $1.6 billion in grant money — or about 57% of the funding cuts.\n\nThe single largest grant canceled: A $95 million award to the Research Triangle Institute, a North Carolina-based scientific research organization that had planned to distribute the money to underserved communities. RTI also lost five other EPA grants, totaling more than $36 million.\n\nMore cuts could be coming. TheWashington Post reportedin late April on a court filing that showed the EPA had targeted 781 grants issued under Biden. The data obtained by Floodlight shows the majority of those grants have already been canceled.\n\nIn June, a coalition of nonprofits, tribes and local governmentssued the EPA, alleging the Trump administration broke the law by canceling environmental and climate justice grants that Congress had already funded.\n\n“Terminating these grant programs caused widespread harm and disruption to on-the-ground projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience and build community capacity to tackle environmental harms,” said Hana Vizcarra, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the nonprofits that filed the lawsuit. “We won’t let this stand.”\n\nThe EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in a written response to Floodlight, the agency said this about the grant cancellations:\n\n“The Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission. The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”\n\nCongress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program in 2022 when it enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden’s landmark climate bill. The program was designed to help the disadvantaged communities that are often hit hardest by pollution and climate change.\n\nBut on Jan. 20, Trump’s first day back in office, he signedan executive orderhalting funding under the IRA, including money for environmental justice, and canceling a  Biden-era executive order thatprioritized tackling environmental racism. Separately, in his orders on diversity, equity and inclusion, Trump called forthe closures of all environmental justice offices and positionsin the federal government.\n\nUnderserved communities are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts such as heat waves and flooding because they have fewer resources to prepare or recover, according to a 2021analysis by the EPA.\n\nInside the agency, not everyone agrees with the new direction. In a“declaration of dissent,”more than 200 current and former EPA employees spoke out against Trump administration policies, including the decision to dismantle the agency’s environmental justice program.\n\n“Canceling environmental justice programs is not cutting waste; it is failing to serve the American people,” they wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, the EPA put 139 of the employees who signed the petition on administrative leave,Inside Climate Newsreported.\n\nThe people at Downwinders at Risk, a small Texas nonprofit that helps communities harmed by air pollution, thought they were finally getting a break.\n\nLast year, they learned that the EPA had awarded them a $500,000 grant — enough to install nine new air quality monitors in working-class neighborhoods near asphalt shingle plants, a gas well and a fracking operation in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The data would have helped residents avoid the worst air and plan their days around pollution spikes.\n\nBut on May 1, the group’s three employees received the news they’d been dreading: Their grant had been canceled.\n\n“It was a very bitter pill to swallow,” said Caleb Roberts, the group’s executive director.\n\nHe and his team had devoted more than 100 hours to the application and compliance process.\n\nThe nonprofit’s annual budget is just over $250,000, and the federal funding would have allowed the group to expand its reach after years of scraping by. They’d even paused fundraising for six months, confident the federal money was on the way.\n\n“We feel like we’re at ground zero again,” Roberts said. “And that’s just very unfortunate.”\n\nThisreportwas originally published by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

    "News_text":"A gargantuan but difficult-to-access gold mine was discovered a few years ago.\n\nThe asteroid might have enough gold in it to drive prices down sharply, if it's ever mined and sold.\n\nBitcoin can't ever experience the same type of problem.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin ›\n\nPrecious metals are only rare when you confine your perspective to what's available on this planet at this moment in time. On that note, 16 Psyche, an asteroid orbiting between Mars and Jupiter, is estimated to contain between $10 quintillion and $700 quintillion worth of gold and other precious metals, meaning that the rock could have reserves of vastly more than all the bullion mined on Earth so far.\n\nWhat's more, NASA launched a probe in late 2023 and expects it to reach the asteroid in 2029 to survey its composition in more detail.\n\nThe odds of a space mining rig ever getting established and shipping ore back to Earth are incredibly remote and not worth pricing into any of your financial models. But even if none of that asteroid's metal ever lands on Earth, the mere possibility of it happening significantly undermines gold's claim to lasting scarcity in the big picture of things.Bitcoin,(CRYPTO: BTC)on the other hand, faces no such threat.\n\nEarth-bound investors like to think of gold as a finite store of value. It's cumbersome to mine more of the metal and requires a lot of capital investment.\n\nThe planet already houses approximately 216,265 tonnes -- or about $16 trillion worth of gold at today's spot price. By comparison, that single asteroid that has captured people's attention theoretically holds enough metal to multiply that supply millions of times over. Flood the market with even a fraction of that supply, and the price of gold would collapse overnight.\n\nAsteroid mining on any commercial scale is decades away and would be wildly expensive -- and we don't yet know what 16 Psyche actually contains -- so gold's scarcity is still in play today and for the foreseeable future. Still, the thought experiment reminds us that gold's scarcity is geological and effort-constrained, not guaranteed as a result of any property of the metal itself.\n\nBitcoin's scarcity is different, and over the very long run, likely to get worse rather than better, meaning it should get more valuable over time. Its software hard-codes a lifetime issuance cap of 21 million coins. Roughly 19.7 million of that sum already circulates, and the reward for creating the rest keeps shrinking every four years in an event called thehalving. The next halving should occur late in the first half of 2028.\n\nUnlike gold, no cosmic mother lode can dilute the coin's holders. The protocol's math is indifferent to new mining techniques, improved refineries, better drills, or interplanetary miners.\n\nA science fiction supply shock from asteroid mining is fun to ponder, but probably won't be realized in our lifetime. Investors need concrete portfolio logic to allocate their capital, so here are three reasons why Bitcoin is more deserving of their allocation than gold in today's economy.\n\nFirst, the asset is not always tightlycorrelatedwith the rest of the market and the economy during times of turbulence, as the cause of turbulence often reasonably affects the demand for commodities like gold. For instance, instability in a country that houses a lot of gold mining companies might cause the price of gold to be highly unpredictable during a time that the market is otherwise tranquil, but that probably won't ever happen with Bitcoin because it isn't exposed to the same set of geography-related risks.\n\nIn 2024, Bitcoin sometimes traded like a tech stock, yet its relationship with other macro assets, including gold, remains inconsistent. When U.S. markets wobbled under the \"Liberation Day\" tariff fears this spring, Bitcoin rallied 15% while the wider market sagged, signaling its capacity to zig when equities zag, even if it isn't guaranteed.\n\nSecond, the coin behaves more like an inflation hedge in countries with weaker fiat currencies than in it does in developed economies. That dynamic could widen as more people face currency debasement and face the risk of capital controls, which are both problems gold historically mitigated. The difference is that it's much easier to transfer Bitcoin across borders, making it more attractive than physical gold.\n\nFinally, Bitcoin's supply curve generates significant upside, but gold's doesn't. Gold's supply grows roughly 1.5% annually. Bitcoin's growth will fall below 0.5% after the 2028 halving, and eventually to zero.\n\nPast halvings preceded multiyear bull runs. Meanwhile, volatility has trended lower with each cycle, offering the potential for a smoother ride to committed holders over the years. It might not ever be as easy of an asset to hold as gold from an emotional perspective, as its price will probably always be far more volatile than that of any precious metal, but it'll probably continue to outperform gold, too. So at least investors might get some compensation for the lost sleep.\n\nStill, none of this eliminates risk.\n\nBitcoin can experience sharp swings in its value. But scarcity that can only intensify, that plus utility that grows with global adoption give it an investment thesis gold can't match. Short-term price action can be bad for holders, but over the long term, it has reliably rewarded those with patience and I predict the same for the future.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Well, their retirement fund was drained, they are at risk of losing their Medicare benefits, prices are rising on everything else, and the preaching has slowed down.\n\nThey are still supporting him, but a bit more quietly now. The signs are off their lawn, Dad took most of the stickers off his truck, and I have had three conversations with him where he didn't bring Trump or MAGA up. It may seem small, but in the last eight years, not a single conversation happened where Dad didn't bring Trump into it. Shows me that while he is still a believer, he is starting to see the cracks.\"\n\n—CatsAreBetterThanPeople\n\n2.\"At first, I tried going point by point using personal examples and facts from sources that they would trust. They ended up dismissing all sources that contradicted Trump until the only things they said they could trust were Trump’s own words. When you point out the obvious falsehoods in his words, they say, 'Oh, well, not those words. He likes to exaggerate.'\"\n\n\"I caught my father reposting some nonsense about higher education brainwashing young people, but when I point out that I am a university professor and ask if he thinks that I am brainwashing people, he says 'no,' and yet he won’t admit that when kids become more liberal in college that it may be due to factors like exposure to new perspectives.\"\n\n(Cont.) \"My mother basically voted herself out of work as an educator with the new funding cuts, but she still doesn’t see the connection between her vote and her new situation, just like she suddenly doesn’t care how much groceries cost after claiming the grocery bills were part of the reason for her vote. They are two of the most privileged people I know, and yet they truly believe that, as Christians, they are oppressed in our society. I can’t think of another group with more reasonable freedoms, yet they fight for the freedom to subject others to their religious beliefs by force.\"\n\n\"I tried to reason with them that declaring a National religion is shortsighted (e.g., what happens when religious practices are defined differently than how you practice) and that religious freedom protects us all. Agreements like this seem to only drive them to more extreme positions (with less and less proof and more dependence on feelings).\n\nI stopped trying to reason with them long ago for my own mental health because they are clearly out for MAGA belonging, tribal identity, and an easy relevancy in society (that they’ve become accustomed to as white middle-class Americans raised in the '50s and '60s). They don’t trust the next generation as far as they can throw them, which seems to be at the root of the problem, but they still claim to love me and my sibling SO MUCH — it is so bizarre, ya’ll.\n\nI’m still rooting for them to somehow spend the rest of their lives in a less hate-filled and fear-mongered state of mind, but my reasoning with them won’t get them there. They are lost right up until they want to be found.\"\n\n—anonymous\n\nRelated:\"Trends That Can Lead To The Alt-Right Pipeline\": This Woman Is Calling Out Ways The Far Right Targets Women And Girls\n\n3.\"My friend kept asking me for references to my side of an argument and then said (when I give them) they weren't reliable sources… no matter what source(s) I offer.\"\n\n\"He references his arguments in advance, mind you, and uses 'independent news sources' (one of which was Joe Rogan).\"\n\n—anonymous\n\nChip Somodevilla \/ Getty Images\n\n4.\"On the night of his embarrassing so-called speech, I told my husband I had never felt so sad to be an American.

I've tried explaining that yes, discrimination is still a thing and is still bad. I've even tried to pull the 'is this what you want for your kid and their husband, who you love' card, and he just shrugged and told me that it'll pass and I'm worrying over nothing. And that's not even getting into our argument about whether the Earth is flat (because QAnon made him a flat-earther) or his admittance that he doesn't really like Trump, but since Democrats are apparently all exclusively demons who kidnap and assault children for fun, that's our best bet.

He suggested that some investors were turning a blind eye and focusing instead on the Trump administration's promises of deregulation.

    "News_title":"Elon Musk Has A Plan To Keep Civilization From Collapsing. There's 1 Little Problem...",
    "News_text":"BuzzFeed and Yahoo may earn commission from links in this article. Pricing and availability are subject to change.\n\nI raised my daughter on disability income, food stamps, and the generosity of friends and family who accepted home-cooked meals for helping me instead of cash. I didn’t have a partner or a safety net. What I had was determination, exhaustion, and the constant fear of falling further behind.\n\nSo when I see billionaires like Elon Musk telling the world tohave more kids or civilization will collapse, I want to scream.\n\nIt’s not that people don’t want families, it’s that we’re drowning in a system that makes them impossible to afford.\n\nIn the three years after my daughter was born, I lost five jobs — not because I wasn’t capable or committed but because I couldn’t always secure reliable child care. Eventually, a close friend stepped in and agreed to watch her for $30 a day and two home-cooked meals each week. That arrangement helped, but it came after we’d already lost everything. With no money and nowhere to go, my daughter and I moved into a spare room in my best friend’s home. We slept in a bunk bed and tried to piece our lives back together.\n\nEventually, I did what so many parents do: I powered through. We moved south of Denver, and I landed a job that allowed us to climb out of the worst of it. For a while, it felt like we were finally moving forward. That is, until I was hit with devastating news about my health and had to go on Social Security Disability Insurance.\n\nSuddenly, we were back to scraping by, this time on just $1,200 a month, with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and Medicaid keeping us afloat.\n\nThere were times I had to choose between paying for food and keeping the car insured. Other times, we couldn’t afford rent and had to stay with family. But I always made sure my daughter had access to what she needed: three meals a day, an orchestra program, and a spot on the color guard. Those opportunities only happened because of public assistance and programs designed to catch people like us before we fell too far.\n\nWithout them, she wouldn’t have had any of it. And I know we’re not alone.\n\nI’ve lived at the intersection of poverty, parenthood and disability. And that’s not just a fork in the road — it’s a carving knife of reality.\n\nI’ve stood in food pantry lines, hoping there’d be a few items left. I’ve skipped meals to make sure my daughter had enough. I’ve felt the shame of judgment from strangers and even family — people who assume that if you need help, you’re either lazy, irresponsible or both.\n\nPeople think single parents live some glamorous sitcom life, but no one shows the scenes where you’re crying over the stove because you can’t afford gas and groceries in the same week. No one shows the trade-offs: the birthday gifts skipped, the medical care delayed, the emotional toll of trying to hold it all together when you’re running on fumes.\n\nAnd then here comes Elon Musk, telling us to have more kids.\n\nIt’s easy to say from inside a mansion filled with nannies. It’s easy to tell people to repopulate the world when you’ve never had to decide between medication and milk. But Musk’s version of “save civilization” sounds a lot like “keep producing children so the labor force stays full,” without making a single change to support the people actually doing the raising.\n\nWe’re raising kids in a world where survival costs more than it ever did. And some of us are trying to avoid dialysis while waiting for a kidney transplant; so no, we’re not lining up to have baby number three just because a billionaire thinks it’s our civic duty.\n\nBut Musk’s fantasy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It echoes throughout Washington, D.C., where conservatives are gutting the very programs that kept my daughter and me alive.\n\nRepublicans just passed their so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid and SNAP programs that millions of Americans, myself included, rely on to survive.\n\nNow that it’s passed, I could lose my eligibility for a kidney transplant. Without Medicaid to supplement my Medicare, I can’t afford the out-of-pocket costs for necessary care and medications. I’ve already had to delay seeing my nephrologist because one safety net was ripped out from under me with only a month’s notice. I can’t imagine what will happen if the rest disappears.\n\nAnd it’s not just me. This will devastate seniors, babies, children, disabled folks, working families, and the communities that already carry too much. Hunger will increase. Local aid programs will definitely be overwhelmed. Hospitals will close. People will die. And what are Republicans getting in exchange? More Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. More billionaires with bigger bank accounts. More cruelty disguised as fiscal responsibility.\n\nBut let’s be honest, these lawmakers are not building a stronger economy. They’re gutting the weak to appease the rich. They’re treating human beings like budget line items. If you don’t contribute enough to their campaign coffers, they don’t care if you live or die.\n\nThis is not a broken system; it’s a functioning machine of economic violence, operated by people who only punch down and call it policy.\n\nSo no, Elon and Republicans, we don’t need more lectures about fertility. We need leadership that values and cares for the people already here!\n\nIf you really cared about families, you’d be fighting for universal child care, health care, housing and food security, not stripping them away. You’d be making sure parents had one less thing to fear, not 10 more.\n\nUntil then? Spare us the speeches. And keep your bootstraps. We can’t even afford the damn boots.\n\nJ.

The stock also fell in June when the Senate blocked spending from Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) on gym memberships and personal fitness activities.\n\nThrough the first half of the year, the stock was down 20% according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nAs you can see from the chart below, the stock fell through February and March, and only managed a modest recovery in the second quarter even though the broad market soared.\n\nAfter announcing last year that Barry McCarthy would step down as CEO, the company began the year with a new chief executive, Peter Stern, who is a co-founder of Apple Fitness.\n\nPeloton shares were up briefly in February as investors bid the stock higher after its Q2 earnings report on Feb. 6 even though the business continued to struggle.\n\nRevenue fell 9% to $673.9 million, and subscribers and members both fell. The company also managed to flip a $81.7 million adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss from the quarter the year before to a profit of $58.4 million.\n\nLater in February and into March, the stock began to fall even as there was no company-specific news out. Instead, the stock seemed to fall in response to weakening consumer sentiment and the broader decline in the stock market. As a seller of high-priced exercise equipment, Peloton is clearly sensitive to consumer spending. In April, the company announced a leadership transition, bringing in Charles Kirol as COO.\n\nIn its fiscal Q3 earnings report, revenue fell again, declining 13% to $624 million, though its cost-cutting efforts paid off as it continued to narrow its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net loss, which improved from $167.3 million to $47.7 million.\n\nOn June 17, the stock fell 12% as the Senate removed a provision from a bill to allow health savings accounts (HSAs) to be used for things like Peloton equipment.\n\nPeloton is making progress on the bottom line thanks to its cost-cutting strategy, and it did raise its revenue guidance in its most recent report.\n\nHowever, it's hard to say that its turnaround strategy is working until the company is able to demonstrate steady growth in both revenue and subscribers. It could take a while for the company to get back there.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Peloton Interactive, consider this:\n\nTheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now… and Peloton Interactive wasn’t one of them.

    "News_title":"The Hotel Oloffson Was a ‘Safe Haven’ in Haiti. Gang Wars Have Turned It to Ashes",
    "News_text":"Tucked away in a hillside garden a short walk from the restive heart of Port-au-Prince, the Hotel Oloffson was a strange kind of refuge. Through good years and a lot of bad ones, it stayed open to all comers, welcoming despite its dark undertones and somehow immune to Haiti’s political strife. A favorite haunt of artists, celebrities, and local intelligentsia, along with aid workers and journalists needing a stiff rum punch to ease the day’s stress, the Gothic gingerbread mansion weathered brutal bouts of violence and natural disasters to become the most storied hotel in the Caribbean. Mick Jagger and Jackie Kennedy Onassis were guests, and it was a centerpiece in Graham Greene’s classic novelTheComediansabout the terrors of dictatorship. Later, it was reborn as a bohemian jam-hall where diverse crowds pulsed to Vodou-rock rhythms deep into the night. After the 2010 earthquake leveled much of the capital, the Oloffson was one of the few hotels left standing. The music went on. And the faithful kept coming back, even as the country descended into lawlessness.\n\nLast weekend, the armed gangs that have a stranglehold on Port-au-Prince burned the hotel to the ground. In recent months the gangs have attacked schools, hospitals, libraries, a historic radio station, and the offices of the country’s oldest newspaper, part of a “very clear and obvious effort to erase all these institutions,” says Haitian American writer Edwidge Danticat, who grew up poor in the capital’s Bel Air neighborhood. “[The Oloffson] was a bridge — a space for connection where different worlds could meet.” While the hotel may be just one more building, “it’s a symbol of something that once might have been left alone,” she adds. “If this place that is so well-known — an international treasure — could not be protected, how much protection is there for ordinary people in Port-au-Prince right now?”\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nJudge Blocks Trump's Bid to Deny Migrants Asylum\n\nMy Best Friend's Murder Was a Tabloid Circus.

Morse still hoped to reopen one day. But after watching a social media video of the hotel aflame in the night, he asked a friend to do a drone flyover to check it out. “When he called me back, he said, ‘I think you better have a seat,’”says Morse. Aerial footage revealed a smoldering ruin.\n\nThe sudden, total loss was a gut punch to the Morse family and generations of hotel patrons who enjoyed camaraderie and music at the Oloffson, no matter the troubles beyond its walls. “We’re heartbroken,” says Isabelle Morse, Richard’s daughter. “It touched so many people: artists, journalists, writers, rich, poor, Black, white, local, international, gay, straight — it was home to all. Everyone has a piece of memory attached to it, and they have no place to go anymore. It feels like somebody died.” Filmmaker Richard Sénécal put it bluntly in a post on X: “What nature couldn’t destroy in nearly a century, barbarism and savagery by our fellow Haitians burned it down in one night.”\n\nThe United Nations estimates the gangs now control 90 percent of the capital, which edges closer to collapse in a vacuum of international apathy and government infighting. Kenyan forces deployed to assist national police have had little impact, undermanned and outgunned by high-powered weapons smuggled in from the U.S. and the Dominican Republic. Nearly 5,000 people have been killed in the past nine months. And with the gangs expanding into new parts of the country, more than 1.3 million are uprooted from their homes, the highest total on record. Soaring costs and drastic aid cuts have left a million children to suffer critical levels of food insecurity.\n\n“So much devastation in the country, so many people getting killed, so many people getting raped — and so many people focusing on a hotel,” Morse says by phone from his home in Maine. “A lot of things are making me really angry. But I guess the bottom line is: If the hotel is going to attract attention to the people that need it, then I guess that’s a positive thing.”\n\nFew establishments are as steeped in history and political intrigue. Built in the late 19th century, it was initially a private residence for the Sams, a powerful family that produced two Haitian presidents, one of whose killing at the hands of a mob spurred the U.S. military to intervene. During the 19-year occupation, it was used as a hospital by Marines until forces withdrew and Werner Gustav Oloffson, a Swedish sea captain, converted the grounds into a hotel in 1935. The Grand Hotel Oloffson, as it was then known, became jet-set famous after the 1950s, when a French photographer bought the hotel and attracted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Tennessee Williams, and Graham Greene, some whose names adorned the guest rooms.\n\nGreene immortalized the hotel inThe Comedians, a haunting novel about life under dictator François “Papa Doc” Duvalier and his dreaded paramilitary goons, the Tonton Macoute. “With its towers and balconies and wooden fretwork decorations it had the air at night of a Charles Addams house in a number ofThe New Yorker,” Greene wrote. “You expected a witch to open the door to you or a maniac butler, with a bat dangling from the chandelier behind him.” The book was adapted into a 1967 film starring Taylor and Richard Burton, but Hollywood glamor was no match for the Duvalier nightmare. When tourism to Haiti dried up, the hotel was left to resident aid workers and journalists, and Aubelin Jolicoeur, the dapper Haitian newspaper columnist who inspired the Greene character “Petit Pierre.” Impossible to miss in a white linen suit and paisley ascot, Jolicoeur was a fixture at the hotel for four decades — an in-house attraction who trafficked in gossip and signaled his arrival each day by tapping the floor with his gold-tipped cane.\n\nMorse took over the lease in 1987 after the fall of the Duvalier regime. The son of a Caribbean scholar and a beloved Haitian entertainer, Morse says he’d learned how to mix art and business while working in New York for Steve Rubell, the co-founder of Studio 54, and set about transforming the Oloffson into a vibrant cultural space. Dropping the “Grand” from the hotel’s name to make it more democratic, he renovated the mahogany bar, added more rooms, and installed a Haitian roots-music band that he named RAM, after his initials. As songwriter-cum-conductor, Morse helmed a rotating cast of musicians and dancers. His future wife, Lunise, became lead female vocalist. (His son William later joined as lead guitarist.)\n\nBy the early 1990s, RAM’s Thursday night concerts were wildly popular, marathon affairs charged with increasingly brazen protests against the military junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. “The band thought, ‘Man, we are invincible,’ you know? ‘We can say whatever we want because no one’s messing with us,’” recalls Morse. “And then at some point in ‘94 they started threatening us. People started following us around thinking that the [U.S.] invasion would be triggered by me getting killed.” That September, 25,000 U.S. troops surged into Haiti to restore democracy and the hotel enjoyed its most profitable run, though trouble was never far. A 1998 assassination attempt during Kanaval claimed the lives of eight supporters.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2010, Haiti was hit with a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people and destroyed vast swaths of the capital. Damaged but unbroken, the Oloffson emerged as a hub for relief workers and journalists who poured in from around the world. Morse served as an essential source of information on RAM’s Twitter feed, and held a free concert three months after the quake on the hotel lawn; thousands showed up. The band would continue to perform regularly to a packed house, a steady drumbeat for Haiti’s recovery. The Oloffson stage also hosted big-name performers, from Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Jackson Browne to Jimmy Buffett and Arcade Fire. “Hotel Oloffson was a hotel on the surface, but it was really a temple, a refuge at the crossroads of culture, music, and social justice,” says Arcade Fire’s Régine Chassagne. “It was an inn for the NGO workers and writers, people passing through, who all had Haiti at heart.”\n\nAs reconstruction staggered along, armed gangs thrived during the 2011 to 2016 presidency of Michel Martelly. A cousin of Morse’s, Martelly armed and financed gangs to extend his power and traffic drugs, laying some of the groundwork for the plague that now grips the country. (Morse served for a time in Martelly’s administration but quit in 2013, citing corruption and mismanagement.) Morse says the Oloffson was deemed to be in a high-risk “red zone,” and foreign staff were either forbidden or discouraged from patronizing the hotel. The July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse plunged the country into greater chaos. And the Covid-19 pandemic brought business to a standstill.\n\nDuring a May 2023 trip toreport on the gang war, I stopped by the hotel one afternoon for lunch. Its iron gates remained open and unguarded, the courtyard overgrown and prowled by dogs. The familiar statue of Baron Samedi, Vodou’s top hat-wearing master of the dead, greeted me at the base of the staircase, but the bar was empty save for Madame Jeudy, its stalwart manager. I ordered a plate ofpoulet créoleand wandered around the dining room taking in the art and curios. Out on the balcony a painter was at work touching up the facade, a small hedge against the decay. It didn’t matter that the food took an hour to arrive. A faint sea breeze cut the heat, and I was glad to be off the streets.\n\n“The Oloffson was always a safe haven,” says Neil Brandvold, an American filmmaker who had to run from trouble in Port-au-Prince on more than one occasion over the years. “As long as you got through the front gates of the Oloffson, everyone left you alone. Just the respect for Richard and the hotel as an institution … It was sort of protected from the gangs and their violence.” On Brandvold’s last visit, in late 2023, however, some attempted kidnappings in the municipal cemetery forced him to cut filming short. He holed up in the hotel for several days with a photographer watching gunfights flare through the night. “I think we were the last people to stay there.”\n\nIn February, I ran into Morse at a heavily guarded hotel in Pétionville, a suburb of the capital. Commercial flights had been shut down for months, and travel around Port-au-Prince was a roll of the dice. Morse told me he’d nevertheless walked down to the Oloffson out of habit, stopping to take selfies with fans along the way, until friends insisted it was too dangerous to go back again. Most members of RAM have since relocated to the northern city of Cap Haitien to keep making music. For his part, Morse released a new song the day before the Oloffson burned down, titled, “We Want Justice.” A cry for Haiti, and all that’s wrong in the world.\n\n“He’s devastated — probably the most devastated of us all,” says Isabelle Morse. “That was our living room. The music, the characters, the people who kept coming back, all that he did to keep it alive and make it this place of resistance and freedom in a place that’s so hard to do that. He spent his whole life doing it. And now it’s gone.”\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nEvery Super Bowl Halftime Show, Ranked From Worst to Best\n\nThe United States of Weed\n\nGaming Levels Up\n\nSign up forRollingStone's Newsletter.

    "News_title":"IRS Rules Churches Can Endorse Candidates. A Progressive Pastor Says That’s Great",
    "News_text":"Donald Trump’s administration is giving churches a green light to explicitly endorse political candidates, without fear of losing their nonprofit tax status, under a proposedcourt settlement. And a leading figure on the Religious Left insists that’s a good thing for Democrats.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service — now led by controversial Trump appointee andX enthusiastBilly Long — proposed a “consent judgment” last week, seeking to settle a court case brought by Christian broadcasters. The IRS seeks to effectively exempt churches from theJohnson Amendment, a federal law that bans tax-exempt groups from politicking. The proposed settlement states that “communications from a house of worship to its congregation… on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted.” The document likens endorsements from the pulpit to “a family discussion concerning candidates.”\n\nSome progressives are sounding the alarm that this ruling will transform houses of worship into a political powerhouse for the MAGA GOP, which relies on evangelical Christians as its base. ButDoug Pagitt, a progressive evangelical pastor and executive director ofVote Common Good, argues that ruling provides much needed clarity — and could actually give progressives a desperately needed boost.\n\nThe Johnson Amendment has long been a phantom menace. It remains on the books, but has been all but unenforced against churches, either purposefully or passively, for decades. This has led to “wild imbalance,” Pagitt says, with right-wing churches becoming integral to Republican politics, while most mainstream and progressive church-leaders have abided by the (dead) letter of the law — contorting themselves to remain at arms length from anything to do with elections, lest they imperil their tax exemption.\n\n“For too long, Republican politicians and their allies have spoken freely from pulpits, while too many Democrats and faith leaders held back, worried they would cross an invisible line,” Pagitt says. “This decision removes that roadblock.”\n\nThe pastor insists Democrats and progressives now have a chance to level the playing field with voters of faith — but acknowledges that doing so will force both the center-left political establishment and progressive church leaders to get out of their comfort zones.\n\nPagitt spoke toRolling Stoneby phone. The transcript that follows has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow did you get involved in politics?\n\nI’ve been an evangelical pastor my whole adult life. I come from that small, dwindling, little wing of the evangelical world that’s called progressive evangelicalism. I got into this in 1983, when there were still a bunch of Jimmy Carter evangelicals; I wax eloquently about how in 1976 and 1980, 60 percent of evangelicals voted for a Democrat from Georgia. My faith motivates what I do and the way I think about politics. And it doesn’t end me up in the MAGA world.\n\nWhat is the mission of Vote Common Good?\n\nWe connect with faith voters who are thinking about their political and their religious identities. Many Christian faith voters have a religious identity that came as a package deal, which ended up with them becoming Republicans. People went to church to follow Jesus and ended up voting for Republicans every time — and they don’t know how that happened.\n\nThen when someone like Donald Trump comes along, people are like,I didn’t think that’s what we were saying ‘Yes’ to.But they watched as the Republican Party and their faith communities went down the road in lockstep.\n\nWe know that doesn’t fit a lot of those people. They’re not sure what to do about that. We help those voters connect their faith identity, and consider voting for Democratic candidates.\n\nHow long have you been active?\n\nSince 2018. We do bus tours and events with Democratic candidates — introducing them to faith voters and faith leaders around the country. We’ve worked on hundreds of campaigns. We did events with [now governor] Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania. We did abunch of work with the Harris campaign. We work with about 40 or 50 congressional candidates per cycle.\n\nYour argument that the IRS ruling could be a good development for Democrats is not intuitive. How do you see it?\n\nThere has been this wild imbalance where Republicans speak about faith issues and faith voters all the time. Democrats rarely do. Republicans have organized almost exclusively under religious identity — so much so that the 2024 Trump campaign used an evangelical religious group,Turning Point USA, as theiron-the-ground organizing.\n\nRepublican candidates will go to churches. Democratic candidates will — if they’re Black churches. But rarely will they find themselves organizing in any other church context, or any other faith community organized around synagogues or mosques or temples.\n\nAnd that’s always been done under the guise of:Well, the IRS laws say that religious communities have to be politically neutral. And there’s no way to be politically neutral if you’re going to talk to a candidate.\n\nRepublicans have never had that problem. Republicans are just wildly running the table on this stuff — having absolutely no issues at all.\n\nThe Johnson Amendment has only been an obstacle, then, but only for one side?\n\nThe IRS became the rationale for the dividing line. I hear from [progressive] pastors and faith leaders all the time:All my conservative counterparts, they talk about politics and tell the people who vote for. But we follow the law. And they’re just lawless.\n\nProgressives and conservatives have been telling two different stories about what the Johnson Amendment implications are, because the IRS has not been clear about it.\n\nAnd now that they have been clear about it, it really creates an opportunity for Democrats to be able to talk to faith voters. And for faith leaders to be open — if they choose — to talk about politics. Maybe to host a forum at their church, or have a political talking group, or let a candidate come in and meet some people in their church without feeling like they’re somehow running afoul of the law.\n\nSo mainstream churches have been so afraid of jeopardizing their tax status they not only won’t endorse Democratic candidates, but won’t even invite them to speak?\n\nA lot of pastors are not even willing to show up at a public meeting supporting a candidate, because they’re so afraid. We deal with this all the time.\n\nThe kind of kabuki theater that churches have had to do is almost comical. In a lot of Black churches, you’ll see a separate part of the building that’s the community center. And you could talk about politics over there, because that’s run by a separate entity of the church. But you can’t do it in the church. It’s ridiculous.\n\nOr we did an event at a church in New Hampshire. This is a Sunday night — it wasn’t a church time. The pastor said,OK, and I’m going to give the welcome. But you have to rent the building with a rental contract — so you’re an outside rental group at the church.Which is fine. And the pastor gave the welcome and said,I want to be clear that I’m giving my welcome from down here on the floor and not up there on the platform where the pulpit is, because when I’m standing up there, I’m in my church capacity, and when I’m here on the floor, I’m in my personal capacity. And you’re just like,Come on.It’s silly. But that was his workaround. He was just trying his best to find some way to not violate the law.\n\nPastor Jeffress [conservative megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress] doesn’t have that concern. He’s not worried about where he’s saying it! Or anything else! So they’ve been running [around] basically saying to America,Republicans love religion, Democrats hate God.\n\nAnd the last 30 years, Democrats have basically said,We have no argument with that.\n\nDemocrats seem institutionally ill prepared for the opportunity you’re describing.\n\nWe’ve been in a situation in which Democrats rarely want to speak about faith voters or even identify or understand faith voters. In 1992, the Democratic [tracking] system removed ‘faith identity’ from the voter file, even organized by faith tradition. If Elie Wiesel was right that the opposite of love is not hate, it’s apathy, the fact that Democrats don’t even know, or care, or think about this is a real problem.\n\nWe’ve worked really hard to try to help Democrats overcome their fear and phobia of faith voters, and help faith voters overcome their fear and phobia of Democrats. Because it’s not good for politics. It’s not good for religion. Pastors feel it. Parishioners feel it. Political parties feel it.\n\nIn other words, Republicans have a food addiction when it comes to religion, and Democrats have an allergy. And we’d like to see, we’d like to see both of them have a healthier relationship. Anything that can get us greater parity and conversation about political and religious identity, we think would be a very good thing.\n\nYou’re confident Democrats can fish for votes in the pews?\n\nNinety percent of Black church attenders vote for Democrats, while 80 percent of white evangelicals vote for Republicans. But the difference in the faith between a Black church member and a white evangelical, it’s not very great. In fact, Black churches are sometimes more conservative socially, theologically, but they’ll vote for Democrats.\n\nWe think a lot of Democrats could really benefit from this [new opportunity to communicate with faith voters.]\n\nA big percentage of people who vote for Democratic presidential candidates are white Christians. Nearly 70 percent are religious people overall. Literally, the base of the Democratic party are religious people, and are white Christian people as well. But inside the Democratic Party it’s like,We’ve never even heard of these people. We don’t know who they are and how are they living in America.It’s the strangest thing.\n\nWe just released abig pollon Christian voter identity, and 80 percent of Christian voters have said they’re open to voting for a Democrat, including 40 percent of people who have never voted for a Democrat in their life. We know there’s a real opportunity here.\n\nTo play devil’s advocate on this. Ireportedduring the campaign on Trump joining a Christian nationalist broadcast promising to roll back the Johnson Amendment. To the extent that churches more explicitly become the GOP’s turnout machinery, no holds barred, that could really deepen their advantage.\n\nIt could. But I think there’s going to be all kinds of blowback.\n\nThe churches that were already comfortable endorsing, despite the lack of clarity the Johnson Amendment, were doing it anyway. There is about 20 percent of the religious community where that’s hard-wired into their political identity — and they’re going to run wild. But their clientele is only so big.\n\nThere’s a lot of conservative Republican pastors who’ve been doing a wink-and-nudge of endorsement. They don’t say anything from the pulpit, but they put out a voter guide, and it all hints in one direction. But they don’t ever have to own it. They’re not going to be able to skate so comfortably down that road.\n\nIn working with faith voters, we meet people all the time. They’re like,I’ve gone to this church for six years. I had no idea they were wanting me to vote for Trump. I wouldn’t have stuck around if I knew that. We never talked about it. And then there was all this implication that came right at the last minute.\n\nAnd there are a lot of conservative pastors that didn’t want the Johnson Amendment to be clarified for churches in this way. They’re like,Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Now I’m going to have that person in my church say, flat out, ‘Why do you not endorse Ron DeSantis for President?’Right?\n\nThis is going to create more openness, more honesty. It’s just going to clarify the relationship between pastors and their parishioners. Our politics and our religion in America could use more honesty, could use more openness, and could use more clarity on issues like this that matter.\n\nFolks are pointing to this ruling as a further collapse of the wall between church and state. Does that trouble you?\n\nWe do a lot of work to try to stem Christian nationalism. We are deeply afraid of that. Some Republicans think that there’s no way to be Christian without being a Christian nationalist. And some Democrats think there’s no way to be talking about faith without also becoming Christian nationalists. Those things are not the same!\n\nThere are Christian nationalists. They are a real problem. We need to respond to them. But that doesn’t mean you should just take the near 80 percent religious identity of America that is Christian, and say:Don’t talk about it. Ignore it.It has not worked well for Democrats. And anything that gets us to a place that lessens the disadvantage that is faced by Democrats is a good thing.\n\nWhat about your faith tradition leads you to believe the Democrats are a natural fit with religious voters?\n\nThe particular movement from the hyper-neocon conservatives, through the Tea Party, now into MAGA — that whole continuum has become toxic in its narrative about the American people’s relationship with one another. It’s pitting people as good guys and bad guys, and patriots and enemies, in a way that is just really volatile. Not only to the American story, but really to the Christian story — as people try to recognize that loving one another is essential, whether that be with your neighbor, or your enemy, or yourself.\n\nWe ask candidates and voters to consider making a love-in-politics pledge. If people come from the Christian tradition, we ask them to look at the section on love from the book of First Corinthians. Love is patient; love is kind; love is gentle; love is self control. And we say, if you see any of that in the current political movement on the Republican side, then feel free to vote your conscience. And if you don’t? Don’t feel that somebody’s forcing you to do that because of some version of your faith.\n\nLook, religious people don’t vote for Donald Trump because they think he’s like them. They vote for Donald Trump because he keeps telling them that helikesthem. Democrats keep saying,We don’t even recognize you.And that’s that’s the problem. The problem for Democrats is not about policy, because most religious people don’t think a lot about policy. It’s about identity and where you feel welcomed. And Democrats seemingly work really hard to try to say to religious people,We don’t care one bit about your religion.Give us your vote. But please don’t think about how religious you are when you’re doing it. It doesn’t make a lot of sense.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson Splits From Trump, Calls for Release of Epstein Files\n\nHow Texas Bullied Big Banks Into Dropping Their Climate Commitments\n\nWhat Trump Has Said About Jeffrey Epstein Over the Years\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nThe Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nAnatomy of a Fake News Scandal\n\nThe Radical Crusade of Mike Pence\n\nSign up forRollingStone's Newsletter.

    "News_text":"Israeli forces have continued to pound Gaza, striking a busy market and a water distribution point, killing at least 95 Palestinians, as the death toll from Israel’s war on the enclave passed the grim milestone of 58,000.\n\nThe Israeli attack on the Gaza City market killed at least 17 people on Sunday, including prominent doctor Ahmed Qandil, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\nIn the central Nuseirat refugee camp, an Israeli missile attackstruck a water collection point, killing at least 10 people.\n\nSeven of the victims were children who had queued up to collect drinking water, according to medical sources. At least 17 others were also wounded.\n\nThe Israeli military is yet to comment on the Gaza City market strike, but said its attack on Nuseirat was aimed at a Palestinian fighter and had veered off course due to technical failure.\n\nThe Israeli claim could not be independently verified.\n\nJessica Dorsey, an international lawyer and an assistant professor at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, questioned Israel’s claim, saying the Israeli military does not take adequate measures to protect civilians in Gaza.\n\n“Mistakes do happen in war, but at a certain point, given the pattern of civilian harm that we’ve seen over the last 21 months, you have to question calling this a mistake, and in fact, actually interrogate whether this is indeed their modus operandi,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Especially with this kind of advanced capability that they possess, we should be seeing more precision, not less responsibility, and unfortunately that’s not the case,” she added.\n\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Health meanwhile said on Sunday that the overall confirmed death toll from Israel’s war has now risen to 58,026 people. More than half of those killed since the war began on October 7, 2023, have been women and children.\n\nThe ministry said at least 138,500 others have also been wounded.\n\nThe war and Israel’s siege have also left 2.1 million people in Gaza on the brink of famine, with the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, announcing the death of another infant from malnutrition.\n\nThe seven-month-old girl, Salam, died while being treated by UNRWA staff on Sunday, the agency said. The latest death came a day after authorities in Gaza said at least 67 children had already died of malnutrition since Israel’s war began.\n\nThe UN’s children’s agency, UNICEF, meanwhile, said that more than 5,800 children were diagnosed with malnutrition in Gaza in June, including more than 1,000 children in severe condition. The figure marks an increase for the fourth month in a row, the agency said in a post on X.\n\n“Children’s bodies are wasting away. This is not just a nutrition crisis. It’s a child survival emergency,” the group added.\n\nUNICEF and seven other UN agencies also issued a separate joint statement, warning that Israel’s blockade on the entry of fuel supplies into Gaza is threatening to shut down hospitals, water systems, sanitation networks and ambulances in the Strip.\n\nIn the statement, the agencies, which also included the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and the UN humanitarian office (OCHA), said they may have to stop their operations entirely “without adequate fuel”.\n\n“This means no health services, no clean water, and no capacity to deliver aid,” the agencies said. “Fuel must be allowed into Gaza in sufficient quantities and consistently to sustain life-saving operations.”\n\nGaza’s Government Media Office, meanwhile, accused Israel and security contractors working at aid distribution points ofintentionally attacking civilians. In a statement, it called United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) sites “death traps” and described the situation as “genocide engineering under US sponsorship”.\n\nAt least 805 people have been killed and 5,250 wounded while attempting to collect aid since the GHF started operating in May.\n\nEfforts to end the war continue in the Qatari capital, Doha.\n\nUS President Donald Trump told reporters that he hoped talks for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will be “straightened out” this week.\n\nHis Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, also speaking to reporters, said he remained “hopeful” about the talks. He said he would be meeting Qatari mediators on the margins of theFIFA Club World Cup Finalin the US.\n\nThe comments came as a US-backed proposal for a 60-day ceasefire remains bogged down in disagreements, with both sides blaming each other for delays.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s deputy leader, Muhammad al-Hindi, said Israel has resisted committing to key conditions before moving on to the topic of prisoners.\n\n“We’re discussing a framework agreement. It includes three points: ending aggression, withdrawal from Gaza and safe aid distribution,” he said. “Israel wants to skip straight to the prisoners’ file without guarantees on the main issues.”\n\nAl-Hindi accused Israel of seeking to control the southern city of Rafah and force civilians into overcrowded, bombed-out areas under the guise of aid distribution.\n\n“We cannot legitimise these aid traps that are killing our people. The resistance will not sign any agreement that amounts to surrender,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Israel, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s close adviser, Jonatan Urich, is facing possible indictment over allegations he leaked classified military information to the German newspaper Bild.\n\nUrich and another aide are accused of passing on secret intelligence to influence public opinion after six Israeli captives died in Gaza last August. The deaths sparked mass protests in Israel and deepened public anger at the government’s handling of ceasefire efforts.\n\nNetanyahu has dismissed the investigation as politically motivated, calling it a “witch-hunt”. Urich has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Bild article, published shortly after the captives’ bodies were discovered, aligned closely with Netanyahu’s narrative of blaming Hamas for the collapse of earlier ceasefire talks.\n\nA previous two-month truce, which began in January, saw the release of 38 captives before Israel broke the ceasefire and resumed its devastating military assault.",

    "News_title":"The ugly truth behind designer cats who pay the price for being cute",
    "News_text":"Cats with particularly cute or funny appearances due to their head shape have become stars on social media.\n\nCelebrities enjoy showing off their extraordinary felines and videos of such animals receive millions of clicks.\n\nWith a round head, big eyes and forward-folded ears, Taylor Swift's Scottish Fold cat is a celebrity in its own right.\n\nFashion model Claudia Schiffer even brought her Scottish Fold to the premiere of a film which also featured the feline.\n\nBut there is a darker side to this trend that is known to only a few people. Animal welfare advocates say the Scottish Fold cats – known for their folded ears – are considered to be the result of harmful breeding practices.\n\nAnimals bred for specific traits, like big eyes, a flat nose or unique coat colours can also struggle with health problems throughout their lives.\n\nSome may have difficulty breathing, or the genetic combination responsible for the desired traits may lead to other physical problems.\n\nBerlin-based veterinary pathologist Achim Gruber calls this \"defect breeding.\" Animals are being deliberately bred with genetic defects to achieve an extravagant or cute appearance, even though the health consequences for the animals have been known - in many cases - for decades, he says.\n\n\"The added value for humans is more important to people than the suffering of the animals. This is, of course, a serious ethical problem,\" he says.\n\nMany of these \"tormented companions,\" as Gruber calls them in the title of his book, end up on the autopsy table at his Institute of Veterinary Pathology at the Free University of Berlin after they die.\n\nHe now seeks to raise awareness about the consequences of certain breeding practices and offer potential ways forward.\n\nHealth problems of the Scottish Fold\n\nVeterinarian Tanja Pollmüller, who runs a practice in Ahlen, North Rhine-Westphalia, often treats trendy cats as patients. Many are Scottish Folds, the cats whose genetic mutation causes their characteristic small, forward-folded ears. They often suffer from severe joint inflammation.\n\n\"They frequently have significant ossifications and pain in their hind legs, to the point where they can no longer walk properly at a very young age,\" says Pollmüller.\n\nShe can usually only help these animals with pain therapy, as a cure is not possible, she adds.\n\nPollmüller also frequently treats Persian cats with excessively short noses, which struggle to breathe. Additionally, she once treated a hairless cat suffering from severe skin rashes and an eye infection, which ultimately led to the loss of one eye.\n\nWhy are such cats still so popular?\n\nPollmüller often finds that many people are unaware of the health problems associated with certain cat breeds. \"Very few pet owners do enough research before acquiring an animal. Most have never even heard of defect breeding,\" she says.\n\nSome owners also ignore their cat's health issues, Pollmüller adds.\n\n\"Most people think that as long as an animal is still walking around, eating and drinking, it must be fine. Unfortunately, they are completely unaware of the animal's suffering or poor quality of life.\"\n\nPollmüller goes online as Doc Polly to educate pet owners about the needs of animals through social media.\n\nElke Rauch from the faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich sees another major issue in the media's portrayal of certain cat and dog breeds, such as their use in advertisements or their association with celebrities.\n\n\"This creates a sense of normality. No one questions whether the animal might have problems,\" she says.\n\nGruber also sees a psychological factor. Small animals like pugs, French bulldogs, Scottish Fold cats or Persians are often seen as substitutes for babies.\n\n\"Everyone finds them cute, and it immediately triggers protective instincts,\" he says. In some cases, the dependency and neediness of the animals become the goal.\n\n\"It boosts a person's self-esteem and social recognition when they care for a sick animal.\" Gruber says he sees many people repeatedly buying such cats, even though they know better.\n\nWhy are these breeds still available for purchase?\n\nIn Germany, a law - section 11b of the Animal Welfare Act to be specific - technically prohibits harmful breeding. However, the law is too vaguely worded, according to the German Animal Welfare Federation.\n\n\"The term harmful breeding does not apply to an entire breed but rather to traits that frequently occur in certain breeds,\" says spokeswoman Nadia Wattad. These traits vary in severity from animal to animal, she adds.\n\nAs a result, veterinary authorities must assess each case individually. Courts can only issue breeding bans on a case-by-case basis, meaning they can only prohibit specific breeders, which does not deter others.\n\nThe planned reform of the Animal Welfare Act would have been a step in the right direction, says Rauch.\n\nSection 11b would have been clarified and expanded to include specific harmful breeding traits, such as breathing difficulties, lameness or hairlessness. However, this reform was not implemented due to the collapse of the coalition earlier this year. \"What happens next is uncertain,\" she says.\n\nWhat can future cat owners do?\n\nExperts emphasize the importance of thorough research and avoiding animals from harmful breeding practices. In general, it is problematic to buy animals where breeding prioritizes desired physical traits over health, Rauch says.\n\nShe also advises against buying animals from online platforms without detailed information about the breeding process and the parent animals.\n\nThe German Animal Welfare Federation recommends adopting cats with harmful breeding traits only from animal shelters. According to spokeswoman Christine Streichan, trendy cats like Scottish Folds or hairless cats regularly end up at the Berlin animal shelter. Some come from illegal breeders.\n\nVeterinary authorities often have the parent animals neutered to prevent further breeding. In most cases, the owners do not want the animals back afterwards.\n\nInterest in such cats is often high among visitors at first, Streichan says. \"But we make sure they go to people who know what they are getting into,\" she adds, noting that this includes potentially frequent visits to the vet and the associated high costs.",

    "News_text":"September S&P 500 E-Mini futures (ESU25) are down -0.29%, andSeptember Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQU25) are down -0.30% this morning, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street after U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his trade war.\n\nPresident Trump said in letters shared on his social media platform on Saturday that the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods imported from both the European Union and Mexico beginning August 1st. Mr. Trump also said that if the EU or Mexico retaliated by increasing tariffs on the U.S., the U.S. would add that figure to the 30% rate. In response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that the EU was prepared to retaliate to defend its interests. “We will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,” she said. However, the EU said on Sunday it would extend its suspension of countermeasures to U.S. tariffs until early August and maintain efforts to reach a negotiated settlement.\n\nShopify Stock is a Bargain - How to Make a 3.2% One-Month Yield with SHOP\n\nTariffs, Inflation and Other Key Things to Watch this Week\n\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Sunday that Trump had seen some trade deal offers and believes they need to be improved, adding that without that, he would move forward with the proposed tariffs on Mexico, the EU, and other countries. “Well, these tariffs are real if the President doesn’t get a deal that he thinks is good enough,” Hassett told ABC’s This Week program. “But you know, conversations are ongoing, and we’ll see where the dust settles.”\n\nAdding to the negative sentiment, Trump and his allies intensified their criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s handling of the costly renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Some administration officials are working to build a case to remove Powell from the Fed’s Board of Governors.\n\nThis week, investors look ahead to the release of key U.S. inflation data, comments from Fed officials, and the start of the second-quarter earnings season.\n\nIn Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major equity averages ended in the red. Albemarle (ALB) slid over -4% and was among the top percentage losers on the S&P 500 after UBS downgraded the stock to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $57. Also, airline stocks retreated, with American Airlines Group (AAL) falling more than -5% and United Airlines Holdings (UAL) dropping over -4%. In addition, Capricor Therapeutics (CAPR) plummeted about -33% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve the company’s cell therapy for a heart condition. On the bullish side, most members of the Magnificent Seven stocks advanced, with Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rising more than +1%.\n\n“The stock market is looking lower due to President Trump’s more hawkish stance on tariffs. With the market overbought and very expensive, the market is getting ripe for some sort of a pullback,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak.\n\nSecond-quarter corporate earnings season kicks off this week, with big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) set to release their earnings reports on Tuesday, followed by Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Goldman Sachs (GS) on Wednesday. Netflix (NFLX), PepsiCo (PEP), Abbott Labs (ABT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and 3M (MMM) are among other major names scheduled to deliver quarterly updates during the week. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, companies in the S&P 500 are expected to post an average +2.8% increase in quarterly earnings for Q2 compared to the previous year, marking the smallest rise in two years.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. consumer inflation report for June will be the main highlight this week. The report will be closely scrutinized for any indications of whether tariffs are already driving up prices and what implications this could have for U.S. interest rates. Investors will also keep an eye on June wholesale inflation data, which will offer insight into pipeline inflationary pressures. Other noteworthy data releases include U.S. Retail Sales, Core Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Manufacturing Production, the Empire State Manufacturing Index, the Export Price Index, the Import Price Index, Initial Jobless Claims, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, Building Permits (preliminary), Housing Starts, and the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index (preliminary).\n\nAlso, market participants will hear perspectives from a slew of Fed officials, including Waller, Bowman, Barr, Barkin, Collins, Logan, Williams, Kugler, Daly, and Cook, throughout the week.\n\nIn addition, the Fed will release its Beige Book survey of regional business contacts this week, which provides an update on economic conditions in each of the 12 Fed districts. The Beige Book is published two weeks before each meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMeanwhile, RBC Capital Markets strategists pushed back their forecast for the Fed to resume easing to December from September, citing the need for more time to evaluate inflation and labor market conditions.\n\nU.S. rate futures have priced in a 93.3% chance of no rate change and a 6.7% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed’s monetary policy committee meeting later this month.\n\nThe U.S. economic data slate is empty on Monday.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.423%, down -0.05%.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.54% this morning as sentiment took a hit after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 30% tariff on most European Union imports starting August 1st. Tariff-exposed automobile stocks led the declines on Monday. Still, the benchmark index’s losses were largely limited by hopes that trade negotiations would result in a less severe rate for the bloc. Trump said in his letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday that the 30% tariff was imposed to “move away” from trade deficits with the EU, which he blamed on the bloc’s own tariffs and other trade policies. EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on Monday that the bloc aims to reach a good trade deal with the U.S., while also preparing potential countermeasures in case the talks collapse. “I intend to speak with my U.S. counterparts again later today, as I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort,” Sefcovic added. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said in a newspaper interview on Monday that the EU has already drawn up a list of tariffs totaling 21 billion euros ($24.5 billion) on U.S. goods if the two sides fail to reach a deal. Investors will closely follow the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council meeting on trade later today, where ministers in Brussels are expected to discuss the current state of EU-U.S. trade relations and the path ahead. Investor focus this week is also on the final estimate of Eurozone inflation, Eurozone industrial production figures, and Germany’s ZEW index of investor sentiment. In corporate news, Lifco (LIFCB.S.DX) plunged over -8% after the company posted weaker-than-expected Q2 pre-tax profit.\n\nThe European economic data slate is empty on Monday.\n\nAsian stock markets today closed mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.27%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.28%.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today as investors digested positive trade data from the country. Energy and bank stocks outperformed on Monday. At the same time, property stocks slumped, extending the pullback from last week’s rally that was driven by speculation over possible stimulus measures. There has been some speculation that the central government may roll out new policies to stimulate markets nationwide, but “we believe that upcoming demand-side property market easing measures are likely incremental instead of large-scale,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note on Monday. Meanwhile, customs data released on Monday showed that China’s exports rose at a quicker pace in June amid easing trade tensions with the U.S., delivering a much-needed boost for the world’s second-largest economy. Also, data showed that the country’s imports rebounded last month. Still, the latest round of tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump kept investors on edge. Analysts caution that Beijing could be indirectly affected by U.S. pressure on third countries widely used for transhipments of Chinese goods. The U.S. president has also threatened a 10% levy on imports from BRICS countries, of which China is a founding member, adding to the risks facing Beijing. Investors now await China’s second-quarter GDP data, scheduled for release on Tuesday, which is expected to influence expectations on whether the country can meet its 5% full-year growth target. Also on Tuesday, key June data will provide further clarity on household spending and industrial activity.\n\nThe Chinese June Trade Balance stood at $114.77B, stronger than expectations of $113.20B.\n\nThe Chinese June Exports rose +5.8% y\/y, stronger than expectations of +5.0% y\/y.\n\nThe Chinese June Imports rose +1.1% y\/y, weaker than expectations of +1.3% y\/y.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed lower today as worries over an upcoming domestic election and lingering uncertainty surrounding trade talks with the U.S. dampened sentiment. Technology and electronics stocks led the declines on Monday. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said the country would continue negotiations with the U.S. to seek a mutually beneficial trade deal after President Trump last week increased tariffs on Japanese imports to 25% effective August 1st. At the same time, prospects of Ishiba’s ruling coalition retaining its majority in the upper house following the July 20th vote are fading. Nomura strategist Fumika Shimizu said, “If the ruling party were to lose its majority in the upper house, there is a risk that trade negotiations with the U.S. will be delayed, and market concerns about fiscal expansion will increase.” Meanwhile, Japanese government bond yields climbed on Monday, nearing levels last seen in May, as worries mounted that an upcoming election could open the door to increased fiscal spending. On the economic front, data released on Monday showed that Japan’s monthly industrial production unexpectedly fell 0.1% in May, defying flash estimates of a 0.5% increase. Separately, data showed that Japan’s monthly core machinery orders, a key gauge of capital spending, fell in May. Economists said that capital expenditure is expected to remain subdued for a while due to ongoing policy-related uncertainty and weak domestic consumption. In other news, Bloomberg reported that Bank of Japan officials are likely to consider revising up at least one of their inflation projections at a policy meeting later this month, after rice and food-related prices rose more than anticipated. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +4.72% to 23.96.\n\nThe Japanese May Core Machinery Orders came in at -0.6% m\/m and +4.4% y\/y, stronger than expectations of -1.4% m\/m and +3.4% y\/y.\n\nThe Japanese May Industrial Production fell -0.1% m\/m, weaker than expectations of +0.5% m\/m.\n\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\n\nAffirm (AFRM) slid over -2% in pre-market trading after BTIG downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) fell more than -1% in pre-market trading after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Equal Weight from Overweight.\n\nBoeing (BA) rose over +1% in pre-market trading after preliminary findings from India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau indicated that last month’s crash of Air India flight 171 was unlikely to be linked to aircraft design or manufacturing.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are moving higher in pre-market trading after the price of Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of more than $123,000. MicroStrategy (MSTR) is up more than +2%. Also, MARA Holdings (MARA) is up over +4%, and Coinbase (COIN) is up more than +1%.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) advanced over +3% in pre-market trading after receiving regulatory approval from China for its $35 billion acquisition of Ansys.\n\nYou can see morepre-market stock movershere\n\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Monday - July 14th\n\nFastenal (FAST), FB Financial (FBK), Equity Bancshares Inc (EQBK), Simulations Plus (SLP), Jewett-Cameron Trading (JCTC).\n\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

    "News_title":"Opinion | Rep. Maxine Waters: My colleagues are making a mistake on crypto",
    "News_text":"I told you so.\n\nBelieve it or not, as an elected official, I hate saying those four words. Not because I don’t like being right, but because when the moment comes to say them, it usually means that something has gone terribly wrong. It also means other elected officials and policymakers were warned and chose to ignore that warning and move ahead anyway.\n\nWe warned them about the risks of tearing down the barriers between commercial and investment banking, and of deregulating regional banks. But those warnings were ignored, those bills became law, and when it all came crashing down, everyone was quick to point fingers, but not at themselves. Now, I’m sounding the alarm about the risks ofpending crypto legislation, which will open the floodgates to massive fraud and financial ruin for millions of American families.\n\nThis week, the House will consider several crypto bills, includingthe so-called CLARITY Actand theGENIUS Act, which proponents claim will establish a pro-innovation regulatory framework for crypto that also safeguards consumers and investors. But the reality is that they would be passing bills written by and for the crypto industry. If either bill passes through Congress, we’ll one day look back on its enactment as a pivotal moment in time — much like we point to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.That legislation dismantled Glass-Steagall’s firewallbetween commercial and investment banking, allowing banks, brokers and insurers to combine into mega financial “supermarkets” — all in the name of “innovation.”\n\nWhen the predatory mortgages-fueled housing bubble burst, these “innovators” who amassed their wealth on the backs of vulnerable families required massive taxpayer bailouts. That is, they privatized their gains and socialized their losses. A warning from the more recent past isthe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, which weakened oversight of regional banks and exposed depositors to potential losses, as seen inthe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023.\n\nCrypto often paints its critics as Luddites at best, anti-American at worst. The fact is, the CLARITY and GENIUS bills wrap themselves in the flag of innovation, but all they really do is replicate the same mess that led to past financial crises: They call for few regulations, minimal enforcement, weak consumer protections and more industry consolidation.\n\nOn top of that, these bills have a special, intentional wrinkle that makes them especially dangerous: They would legitimize and legalize the unprecedented crypto corruption by the president of the United States.\n\nDonald Trump and his family are raking in piles of cash, much of it through shady crypto ventures, which have made Trump$1.2 billion richer.At the same time, the Trump administration has gutted watchdogs and silenced critics, allowing Trump to exploit the oversight gap created to enrich himself through meme coins, stablecoins and backroom deals with foreign governments. What we’re witnessing isn’t just unethical; it’s the largest fraud and abuse of power in modern history.\n\nTrump has used the power of the presidency to pitch crypto deals abroad — engaging with questionable and dangerous foreign entities. The bills Congress will consider this week place no checks on that behavior. Indeed, they make it easier for Trump’s personal financial interests to dictate U.S. policy.\n\nIn committee, Democrats offered numerous amendments to curtail the president’s abuse of power. Republicans voted down every single one.\n\nTrump’s corruption shouldn’t be our only concern, however.\n\nA big problem with these bills is that they fail to protect consumers. The CLARITY Act handcuffs the Securities and Exchange Commission, preventing it from proactively protecting people against fraud. Regulators would have to wait until after investors have already been harmed to act — potentially after a company has collapsed and life savings have vanished. We’ve seen this before.FTX collapsedbecause insiders illegally operated the exchange, controlled customer funds and traded against their own clients. The CLARITY bill does nothing to address that and, in fact, actually creates space for similar schemes. This won’t just affect consumers in crypto markets — CLARITY willunderminetraditional securities markets by creating loopholes that traditional firms can use to evade our existing securities laws.\n\nThe GENIUS Act is no better. Though its supporters say it will provide urgently needed protections for users of stablecoins, there’s no funding provided to regulators to implement the law, and the consumer protections it provides are weak. In contrast to the way banks are regulated, there are no community reinvestment requirements, no third-party vendor oversight, and the federal oversight of stablecoin issuers licensed by states or overseas is weak. This leaves users vulnerable to fraud and discrimination.\n\nA second problem is that the bills create serious national security risks. While the CLARITY Act mentions the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), it does little to actually enforce it. During the House Committee on Financial Services’ markup of the bill, Republicans summarily rejected Democratic proposals to ensure crypto companies comply with the BSA, commensurate with the risks of financial crime facing their firms. The bill also broadly exempts the decentralized finance industry from nearly all oversight, a category that Trump’s World Liberty Financial notably claims to fall under. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act opens the floodgates to foreign-controlled crypto that poses serious national security risks, all to appease Trump’s inner circle,which has ties to crypto.\n\nA third problem is that the bills entrench Wall Street’s power. Crypto has long been sold as a way to democratize finance away from big banks. But these bills will only strengthen Wall Street’s dominance alongside Big Tech, while squeezing out smaller innovators. They give megabanks and Big Crypto the green light to consolidate control.\n\nThis should be enough reason for my colleagues to vote no.\n\nIn a few weeks, we’ll mark the 15th anniversary of the Dodd-Frank Act, landmark legislation that Congress passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. That crisis was made so much worse by one of those Wall Street supermarket firms, AIG, an insurance giant that was allowed to insure complex, poorly regulated and dangerous financial instruments. I will never forget the despair of Americans who lost their homes, jobs and life savings then. Many of them never recovered.\n\nPassing the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts would prove that we learned nothing from that disaster. Congress now has a choice: Protect the public and uphold democratic accountability, or hand over the keys to a president using his power for personal gain.\n\nIf these bills become law, America will eventually face its first crypto financial crisis. And when that happens, my Republican colleagues will likely point fingers at everyone but themselves, just as they’ve always done, and say they had no idea this could happen.\n\nBut I won’t. I’ll say I told you so. And then I’ll get to work on cleaning up their mess.\n\nThis article was originally published onMSNBC.com",

    "News_title":"Behind the ad blitz to get R.I. lawmakers to reject bills protecting patient access to discount meds",
    "News_text":"Rhode Island has joined a growing list of states that have passed laws to stop drugmakers from limiting where patients can fill prescriptions for discount drugs under the federal 340B program. (Mint Images\/Getty Images)\n\nA Washington D.C.-based nonprofit spent over $400,000 on ads in the final weeks of the 2025 Rhode Island legislative session to persuade state lawmakers to vote against legislation aimed at protecting a federal drug pricing mandate from manufacturer interference.\n\nBut it wasn’t enough.\n\nThe General Assembly ultimately passed the tripartisan legislation to prevent drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) fromcontrollingpatient access to discounted medications under the federal340B Drug Pricing Program. The program, which began in 1992, requires manufacturers to offer steep discounts to participating providers, often small community health centers and safety net hospitals.\n\nGov. Dan McKee signed thecompanion billsby Rep. Jon D. Brien, a Woonsocket independent, and Sen. Bridget Valverde, a North Kingstown Democrat, into law on June 27. The legislation had overwhelming support in the House, including from nine of the chamber’s 10 Republicans. Both bills saw unanimous approval by the Senate.\n\nRhode Island House lights up to protect federal drug discount program from Big Pharma\n\nRhode Island now joins a growing list of states that havepassed lawsto defend contract pharmacy use or prohibit PBM discrimination against 340B entities. The laws have come in response torestrictions imposed by manufacturerson 340B participants limiting where prescriptions can be dispensed, especially those filled at contract pharmacies, like a patient’s local CVS or Walgreens, that fill prescriptions on a provider’s behalf.\n\nThe law allowing Rhode Island’s new protections takes effect Oct. 1, 2025.\n\nRhode Island’s 340B program received a boost from the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which called on the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to align itself with some of the same actions in Brien and Valverde’s bills, such as preventing manufacturer discrimination against contract pharmacies. Thebudget clausealso asks for annual reports from 340B providers and oversight from the Auditor General.\n\nThe new law is a blow to the Big Pharma lobbyists who have been critical of 340B, arguing that hospitals and pharmacies exploit the federal program for profit. Such was the message in the 789 TV and radio spots urging Rhode Island lawmakers to“stop 340B abuse today” purchased by Community Action for Responsible Hospitals during the final weeks of the legislative session.\n\n“Rhode Island families go broke, CEOs get rich,” stated a TV ad that aired on WJAR Channel 10 during the weeks surrounding the end of the legislative session, which wrapped up June 21.\n\nCommunity Action for Responsible Hospitals’websitedescribes its membership as “patient-focused stakeholders” including labor unions, faith leaders, health care providers, consumer advocates, and public interest groups.\n\nThe Washington-D.C. group spent $178,881 to air ads on Channel 10 and cable, along with radio stations WPRO and WEAN, between mid May and late June, according tofilingsmade with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\n“I saw a couple of the ads on TV, and it struck me,” Matthew Ulricksen, an associate professor of political science for the Community College of Rhode Island, said in an interview. “I don’t really remember seeing much of an advertising campaign by interest groups around a state budget debate before.”\n\nUlricksen said the little information available suggests the group could be Big Pharma companies masquerading as a pro-labor, pro-consumer.\n\n“If Bristol-Myers Squibb Company runs an ad on TV in Rhode Island, that’s going to raise peoples’ eyebrows,” he said. “[Instead], they look like a public interest group that is doing this for a noble purpose rather than corporations that are lobbying to protect their bottom lines.”\n\nThe ads also caught Brien’s eyes and ears. The lawmaker said he believes the money to pay for them came from pharmaceutical companies.\n\n“I felt that every time they ran that ad that it helped our cause,” Brien said in an interview. “I was able to say the only opposition we have is Big Pharma — this is them and they’re lying to you, as usual.”\n\nCommunity Action for Responsible Hospitals lists transparency in hospital ownership and pricing among its primary policy priorities. But as anot-for-profit 501(c)(4), the group is not required to reveal its donors. However, it must file a statement of revenues and expenses annually with the IRS, though the organization is not listed on the federal government’s nonprofit database.\n\nThe group’s social media presence consists of accounts onX,Instagram,LinkedInandYouTube— all with relatively few followers and posts since going online in the spring. The YouTube channel has one subscriber and no content at all.\n\n“That’s exactly what they do — it’s slapdash,” Ulricksen said of pop-up lobbying groups.\n\nCommunity Action for Responsible Hospitals’ website claims that 340B “hurts labor.” But the labor union representing Rhode Island’s health care workers backed the state’s 340B legislation. SEIU 1199NE wrote to the House Committee on Health and Human Services in April that the bill was a way the state could “help prevent the collapse of our community health infrastructure.”\n\nThe group is not on the radar of the state’s most powerful union leader.\n\n“That does not sound familiar to me,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said when asked if he had heard of Community Action for Responsible Hospitals.\n\nThe Rhode Island Secretary of State’s lobby tracker database lists at least 13 pharmaceutical companies registered to lobby the General Assembly in 2025. Four —Eli Lilly,Bristol Myers-Squibb Company,Amgen Inc., andSanofi— indicated their opposition to the 340B legislation, H5634 and S114. Johnson & Johnson, Alexion, GlaxoSmithKline, Purdue Pharma, Otsuka, Novartis, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and Vertex did not list any stance on the legislation.\n\nMerck & Co. was listed as “watching” the companion bills, according to itsfilingswith the state.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), one of several trade groups registered to lobby at the State House,testified in oppositionbefore the House Committee on Health Human Services on April 10.\n\nRhode Island Current reached out to PhRMA to inquire about its familiarity with Community Action for Responsible Hospitals.\n\n“I have not heard of them,” Stami Turk, director of state public affairs for PhrMA, said in a phone interview.\n\nCommunity Action for Responsible Hospitalsofficially registeredas a lobbyist with the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s Office on May 27 — less than a month before the end of the 2025 legislative session. Faith Cybowski, spokesperson for the office, said it’s very common for entities to pop up late into the legislative year.\n\n“The requirement is just that the lobbyist registers within seven days of conducting the lobbying activity and then files reports as required,” Chybowski said via text message.\n\nTwo reportsdetailing the group’s lobbying activity were submitted to the state. The reports list no contributions related to opposing the 340B legislation. But two disbursements totaling $404,845 are listed for advertising by a company listed as “Fifty-Six Media LLC.”\n\nThe ads were not done by the New York City firmof that name, its founder and CEO confirmed via email Monday morning.\n\n“We have never worked with budgets this large, nor have we ever done business with a RI based firm,” wrote Katelyn Glass.\n\nShe referred Rhode Island Current to the website of a separate firm named “Fifty-Six Digital” based out of Grahamsville, New York, according to itswebsitefull of placeholder text. The firm’s owner, Chad Phillips, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nThe reports list one lobbyist: Michael Kapsa, with a phone number and email address. The voicemail greeting indicates the user has a Google Voice number to handle calls. Rhode Island Current left three messages, none of which were returned.\n\nBut Kapsa responded to an email with a brief statement critical of Valverde’s legislation:\n\n“Senate Bill 114 lacks transparency and oversight and would accelerate the misuse of the 340B program that drives up costs for Rhode Island patients, union members, and underserved communities,” Kapsa wrote. “It gives a blank check to bad actors who abuse 340B to pad profits instead of helping patients.”\n\nKapsa is the chief financial officer forSolidaritUS Health, a Washington D.C.-based health care group that partnerswith local insurance exchanges that share claims databases to develop primary care programs for employer and labor union employees.\n\nSolidaritUS was founded in 2017 as an offshoot of “America’s Agenda,” an alliance of labor, business, health care providers and policymakers with Kapsa serving as its chief economist. The company’s chairman is Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic Missouri congressman turned lobbyist whose firm hasrepresentedthe multinational pharmaceutical company Bayer.\n\nIn 2021, Kapsa was tapped by the Biden administration tojoin a federal advisory committeemeant to help the U.S. Department of Labor develop a standard format for group health plans to all payer claims databases.\n\nFCC filings list Kapsa’s name as the primary ad buyer in Rhode Island. They also name Dr. Steven Sleigh as the president of Community Action for Responsible Hospitals. Sleigh is a D.C.-area consultant who previously worked for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, according to hisLinkedInprofile.\n\nThe names of both Sleigh and Kapsa appear on a 990 tax form submitted by thePbm Accountability Project, a pop-up lobby that aired ads in Washington D.C.in 2023as Congress considered various bills meant to ensure PBMs keep drug prices low.\n\nRhode Island Current reached out to Sleigh on June 30 and followed up on July 3.\n\n“Really don’t have any comment on the Rhode Island situation,” Sleigh said in an email response on July 3.\n\nCommunity Action for Responsible Hospitals also led lobbying efforts against legislation to protect the 340B program inOregonandIllinois. Their lobbying wasunsuccessful in Oregonwhile the bill in Illinois is still under consideration.\n\nBrien likened the group’s expensive efforts in Rhode Island to “the last gasp of a dying man.”\n\n“They could have thrown a million dollars at this thing and you weren’t going to move the legislators in the House and the Senate on this one,” he said. “You could have run them every 10 minutes and it wouldn’t have mattered.”\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the nature of the business relationship between Fifty-Six Strategies and Community Action for Responsible Hospitals.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",

The first home had people living in it, but nobody was home at the time of the fire, Sanford said.\n\nAn occupant of a house directly west of the first home that caught fire reported it to authorities.\n\nConneaut Police officers blocked traffic on Liberty Street at Mill Street and east of the fires on Liberty Street. Main Street was also blocked at Mill Street because firefighters used a hydrant on Main Street to help increase water pressure while dousing the two main fires and protecting other homes from further damage, Sanford said.\n\nA ladder truck from Ashtabula was called to the scene, as were firefighters from Ashtabula Township, Monroe, West Springfield and Kingsville. Sanford said all off-duty Conneaut personnel were called out to battle the blaze, as well.\n\nFirefighters were still dousing the homes with water just before 7 p.m. Saturday evening, and a representative of the Ohio State Fire Marshal arrived on-scene at 7:03 p.m. to investigate the cause of the fire.\n\n“The city brought in a track hoe and we did get the partially collapsed west side of the [first fire] building knocked down,” Sanford said of the efforts late Saturday evening.\n\nDozens of people lined the street, watching the firefighters, and people brought drinks for them, as well.\n\n“The outpouring of support from the community [was great],” Sanford said. “We had people bringing ice water, Gatorade, and pizza from area shops ...

    "News_title":"What are the common causes of crane accidents?",
    "News_text":"Cranes are fundamental to various industries, including construction and manufacturing. Operating heavy equipment like cranes involves risks that can seriously impact lives, operations, and costs. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is an average of42 crane-related fatalitiesin the U.S. each year. Additionally, 24% of fatal work injuries involving cranes take place in the manufacturing industry.\n\nUnderstanding what causes crane accidents can help make the work environment more secure andminimize the impact of accidents, injuries and fatalities. This guide byCICBlooks at five common causes of crane accidents and explores preventive strategies that can help minimize crane-related risks. That way, you can train your team accordingly and implement the necessary precautions on your construction site to reduce these hazards as much as possible.\n\nCrane accidents can happen for numerous complex reasons. While there is usually a primary cause one can point to when a crane accident occurs, it is often a series of problems that culminate in the accident. For example, a lack of training may result in poor communication that causes the accident, or a combination of inadequate planning and environmental factors can result in an incident. Here are the five most prevalent causes of crane accidents include.\n\nMost crane accidents involve human error of some degree. Human error is often the result of improper equipment use, inadequate training, poor communication on-site, and a few other factors.\n\nImproper operations:Operating the crane outside of its parameters can lead to injuries and fatalities. Improper operations include exceeding the crane's load limits and using incorrect rigging techniques.\n\nLack of training:Operating a crane takes incredible skill, but no one can rely solely on skill to get the job done safely. Every worker on-site must betrainedextensively to understand the correct safety protocol. Comprehensive training also enhances soft skills that contribute to workplace safety, like communication and teamwork.\n\nPoor communication:Clear communication is an essential part of workplace safety in construction and manufacturing. Misunderstandings can lead to dangerous errors, as can a lack of effective communication in an emergency situation.\n\nDistractions:Distractions increase risks on a construction site or a manufacturing plant. In a work environment where serious accidents can happen in a matter of seconds, workers cannot afford to be distracted by their phones or let their minds wander.\n\nComplacency and routine risk:Complacency, overconfidence, and unlawful or risky behavior can easily result in crane accidents. In these scenarios, a worker may neglect safety protocol due to their overconfidence and act more daringly. This attitude puts them and their co-workers at risk. At times, these actions may be completely unlawful, such as when a worker is under the influence of alcohol or other substances.\n\nThese types of accidents can result from malfunctions or failures in structural components, mechanical systems, control systems and indicators, and power systems. When structural components fail, the outcomes can be catastrophic and even fatal. The following structural components can experience failure.\n\nBoom:Boom failure can happen for numerous reasons. The metal could be fatigued or corroded, or there may be weld defects. Exceeding load capacity can also cause the boom to collapse, which can lead to devastating destruction, severe injuries, and fatalities. The boom is a massive and heavy component, and it can fall from elevated heights if not properly secured and maintained.\n\nJib and extensions:Compromised points and pins can compromise the structural integrity of the boom extensions and jibs.\n\nCounterweight system:If the counterweight system fails, the entire crane can tip over, injuring operators and others on-site and destroying surrounding property.\n\nOutriggers:Outriggers help provide additional stability during lifting operations, and if they fail, the crane can tip.\n\nMast section:The mast section also helps provide structural support. If it has faulty spigots or defects, it may fail, increasing the risk of the crane tipping or components collapsing. Improper rigging and overloading can also strain the mast section.\n\nA crane's mechanical system includes the brakes, clutch, gearbox, pulley systems, and hydraulic systems. When these components are compromised, the crane can move uncontrollably. An operator may not be able to slow or stop the crane from colliding with property or people, or they may have trouble safely controlling the load when experiencing mechanical failure.\n\nControl and power system malfunctions and indicator failures can also result in devastating accidents. If any of the electronics or sensors fail, the crane cannot detect potentially hazardous conditions like wind gusts, overloading, and proximity to hazards like overhead power cables. Recognizing the dangers of improper and infrequent maintenance is essential.\n\nEnvironmental factors like bad weather and other poor working conditions can make a site unsafe. Safety measures in place, like sensors, can warn of less-than-ideal working conditions. Often, though, working conditions can be ideal and then swiftly change in the middle of operating a crane, sometimes at a crucial moment. Here are environmental factors that can be a concern.\n\nWind:As a general rule of thumb, workers should halt or postpone operating a crane in winds exceeding 20 miles per hour, or 32 kilometers per hour. However, a safety manager may determine that operations should be halted or postponed in wind speeds lower than 20 miles per hour, especially when other poor conditions factor into the decision.\n\nPoor visibility:Weather conditions like fog, rain, or snow can make it difficult for operators to see the load and their surroundings. Clear visibility is essential for safe crane operation, so cranes should not operate when visibility is low.\n\nUnstable ground:Crane stability — and, hence, crane safety — largely depends on the condition and stability of the ground.\n\nSometimes, the events that cause crane-related accidents seem greatly beyond anyone's control. However, it is crucial to prioritize safe working conditions and emergency response training to help minimize the severity of these types of accidents.\n\nProper rigging helps verify that loads are secured and lifted safely. Several factors can lead to rigging-related accidents, primarily involving load instability from miscalculations and using incorrect or damaged slings.\n\nImproper rigging:Failing to apply correct rigging practices for each load can lead to load instability. These practices include proper load management strategies, clear communication while rigging, and adherence to general safety protocol.\n\nUsing incorrect slings:If the wrong slings are selected and are not rated for the weight of the load, the load can be unstable and drop.\n\nImproper sling angle:Using improper sling angles that exceed the manufacturer's recommendations can increase the stress on the rigging equipment and reduce lifting capacity. In extreme circumstances, improper sling angle can lead to failed lifts that result in injuries and destruction.\n\nDamaged slings:Slings that are cut, frayed, worn, and damaged can cause load failure.\n\nFailure to inspect rigging: Neglecting to inspect rigging equipment before each use may have catastrophic consequences. For greater safety, one should do a thorough visual check of all hardware, including the slings, shackles, and hooks. The load capacity markings must also be legible and verified.\n\nInadequate planning greatly affects operations and can lead to property damage, injuries, and fatalities. Examples and case studies showing the seriousness of improper planning include the following.\n\nImproper Site Assessment and Setup\n\nFailing to assess a worksite and set up properly led to a fatal incident in November 2003, whena 66-year-old equipment operatorwas killed on-site. The operator, who was an experienced worker, positioned the crane on unstable ground between two ponds.\n\nThe operator allegedly started dredging and attempted side-angle operations without deploying the outriggers. The unstable ground and improper setup caused the crane to tip over. The operator jumped from the cab, and he was sadly crushed by the lattice boom crane.\n\nImproper Use of Cranes\n\nFour workers were killed and six were injuredin the collapse ofa crane in Texas on July 18, 2008. The incident involved one of the world's largest cranes at the time, the Versa TC-36000. The crane fell backward when the operator, an unqualified worker operating the massive crane for the first time, lost control of the crane. The collapse also brought down a smaller support crane with it.\n\nWorking Through Dangerous Conditions\n\nOn Feb. 5, 2016, a 570-foot-high Liebherr crawler crane collapsed in Manhattan, New York. The unfortunate incident resulted inthe death of a motorist. The collapse also left two pedestrians injured. The crane was operating in high winds, despite the recommendation to lay the crane down in winds over 20 miles per hour.\n\nThis was not the only violation of safety recommendations. The operator had also lowered the boom to 69.4 degrees in these windy conditions, where the recommendation was not to have the boom angle lower than 75 degrees. There may have been a lack of clear instructions contributing to these circumstances.\n\nInadequate Load Assessment and Miscalculations\n\nA lattice boom mobile crane overturned in 2010, causing over $100,000 in damage. The accident, referred to as theJay Jay Railroad Draw Bridge Crane Incident, occurred when the crane overturned on a barge while placing pilings with a hydraulic driver.\n\nThe loft planner miscalculated the weight of the hydraulic driver, causing the load toexceed the crane's lift capacity. The miscalculation led the operator to believe the load was 9 tons, but it was actually 10.5 tons. The load swung perpendicular to the crane's crawler tracks, and the crane tipped and fell over.\n\nFailure to Plan for Overhead Power Lines\n\nA report by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration shows that in the U.S., thethird leading cause of deathwhile working on a construction site is electrocution. Many of these events occur because of contact with overhead power lines.\n\nEven workers on foot who touch or guide crane loads can be injured or killed if a crane comes into contact with power lines. Proper planning and detailed lift plans are essential for a safe working distance from power lines that minimize these risks.\n\nPoor Planning for Assembly and Disassembly\n\nThe 2008 NYC Tower Crane Collapse highlighted the need for written procedures and critical processes for “jumping”a tower crane, making it taller as a building grows during construction.\n\nIn this incident, the tower crane collapsed while being “jumped,” killing seven people and injuring 24. The devastating accident occurred because temporary restraints were removed before permanent ones were installed, showing a clear lack of planning, training, and supervision by qualified site managers.\n\nSome of the statistics for injuries and fatalities related to crane accidents reflect how severe they can be. The World Steel Association published a 2024 data report on safety and health in the industry. One of the datasets in the report examined the ratio between lost-time injuries (LTIs) and fatalities from 2004 to 2023. During this period, overhead crane accidents resulted in897 LTIs and 103 fatalities.\n\nAll crane accidents should be taken seriously, as should preventive measures. Having prevention strategies in place for all construction and manufacturing environments is crucial for minimizing accidents that cause property damage, severe injuries, and loss of life. Crane accident statistics reinforce how vital workplace safety is in these industries. Each construction and manufacturing company and site should prioritize adequate and ongoing training, including crane operator training, overhead crane training, rigger training,crane inspector training, and crane supervisor training.\n\nDevastating accidents involving cranes have far-reaching consequences. Workers and bystanders can be injured or lose their lives, and surrounding businesses can also suffer costly damage. These incidents also negatively impact the construction and manufacturing industries — companies risk their reputation and their operations, and the results can sometimes be permanent due to bankruptcy or legal outcomes.\n\nClosely examining the common causes of crane accidents can help businesses proactively address safety concerns, and ongoing training, inspections, and maintenance can make businesses safer and more compliant. Companies that prioritize prevention strategies that minimize crane-related injuries and fatalities help grow crucial sectors in construction and maintenance.\n\nThis storywas produced byCICBand reviewed and distributed byStacker.",

Taken together, they point to something deeper: a struggle over who gets to set the rules inside Israel’s democratic system – those elected to lead or those appointed to constrain them.\n\nTo some, what has transpired in the last two days is nothing less than judicial reform by other means.\n\nThe sweeping overhaul that filled Kaplan Street beforeOctober 7, 2023, may be on pause, but the impulse to rebalance power between branches of government hasn’t gone anywhere. It’s just shifted tactics.\n\nTo others, these steps represent precisely the kind of correction the system needs: reining in officials who have overstepped their role and obstructed governance.\n\nEither way, the balance between the political echelon and the legal establishment is being tested and possibly rewritten.\n\nOn Monday, a five-member ministerial committee met to hold a “dismissal hearing” for Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. She did not attend and minced no words explaining why.\n\nIn a letter released to the public, Baharav-Miara called the hearing a “sham” with a “predetermined outcome” and said her presence would only lend legitimacy to a process that violates decades of legal precedent.\n\nThe committee, appointed by Justice MinisterYariv Levinand led by Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli, bypasses the traditional Grunis Committee and is composed entirely of cabinet ministers: Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Gila Gamliel, and Michael Malchieli. According to the attorney general, this marks a break with a 30-year norm: that dismissing a sitting attorney general must be reviewed by an independent body.\n\nIn her response, Baharav-Miara argued that the hearing would set a precedent allowing the government to dismiss not only her but any future attorney general, for improper or politically motivated reasons – such as blocking illegal actions, launching investigations, or indictments against coalition members, refusing to halt criminal proceedings, or as part of a political deal to keep the government in power.\n\nLevin has argued that the relationship between the attorney general and the government has long since broken down, paralyzing government operations at a time of national emergency.\n\nThe High Court declined to intervene in the matter on Sunday as Baharav-Miara and her supporters had hoped, allowing the hearing to proceed – but made clear the process was “not irreversible.”\n\nIf the attorney-general lost in court on Sunday morning, she responded later in the day with moves of her own.\n\nFirst came news that an indictment would be filed, pending a hearing, against top Netanyahu aide Jonatan Urich on national security charges.\n\nAccording to a statement from the attorney general’s office, Urich – alongside former Prime Minister’s Office spokespersonEli Feldstein– is accused of extracting highly classified intelligence from IDF systems and leaking it to the German daily tabloid Bild, specifically to shape public discourse around the murders of six hostages in Rafah, in August 2024.\n\nThe material, according to the attorney-general, was “classified at the highest level” and “obtained via a covert intelligence method,” with its release allegedly “endangering state security and human lives.”\n\nOn the same day, Baharav-Miara’s office also revealed that Israel Prison Service chief Kobi Yaakobi – a Ben-Gvir ally – is facing possible charges for passing classified information to a police officer who was under covert investigation for failing to act on alleged settler violence.\n\nBoth developments sparked furious reactions from Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir, who accused Baharav-Miara of using the legal system to protect her job.\n\nInside the coalition, the timing was seen as no coincidence.\n\nTo some observers, Baharav-Miara’s announcements were an effort to echo the precedent set in the case of former Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) head Ronen Bar.\n\nIf the attorney-general has active investigations involving Netanyahu’s close circle, she could argue that the government is in a conflict of interest and cannot legally move to dismiss her – just as the court ruled in the case of Bar that Netanyahu could not fire him because of conflict of interest since top aides – again, Urich and Feldstein – were being investigated in the “Qatargate” affair.\n\nAs if all that weren’t enough, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation also moved forward a bill to the Knesset on Sunday that would allow incoming governments to dismiss senior officials – including the attorney-general, IDF chief of staff, police commissioner, and Shin Bet director – within the first 100 days of taking office.\n\nThe bill would also permit the reversal of some decisions made by outgoing officeholders. No misconduct required – just “substantial disagreement.”\n\nSupporters of the legislation argue that a government should be able to implement its agenda using officials it trusts, especially if it is ultimately held responsible for results.\n\nCritics argue that it effectively politicizes the top tier of Israel’s professional class.\n\nDeputy Attorney-General Gil Limon warned that it would turn the government into “the attorney-general, the chief of staff, and the police commissioner all at once.”\n\nIn a system with no constitution and only one legislative chamber, they warn that stripping these positions of independence would remove key checks on executive power, leaving the system prone to abuse, partisanship, and overreach.\n\nIt’s tempting to treat these developments as separate stories. But they’re not. They’re all part of the same institutional battle: over who has the final say, who holds real authority, and who has the right to challenge it.\n\nThe saga over Baharav-Miara’s firing boils down to whether a government can remove a legal official it sees as obstructing its mandate.\n\nThe pending indictments against Urich and Yaakobi raise questions about whether prosecutors can act against senior officials without triggering accusations of political bias.\n\nAnd the proposed legislation now moving to the Knesset seeks to tip the balance in favor of elected leaders by redefining the rules of professional oversight.\n\nPresident Isaac Herzog addressed the situation in unusually stark terms on Monday, likening it to a roller-coaster that has lost its brakes. “Inside the lead car there is utter chaos,” he said. “Everyone is attacking everyone. Everyone is blaming everyone. Everyone is striking out. This is very dangerous.”\n\nHerzog praised Baharav-Miara’s performance during the war and called on all sides to act responsibly. “Stop before we collapse into the abyss,” he urged.\n\nWhile this may not be the sweeping judicial overhaul that brought hundreds of thousands into the streets in 2023, the core questions remain unchanged: Who holds the final say in a system without a constitution, with few checks on executive power, and where legal officials are tasked with holding accountable the very politicians who appoint them?\n\nThe answer to that question won’t just determine the fate of one attorney general; it will shape the future rules of the game.",

    "News_title":"Heartworms in Cats: Rare, Deadly, and Easier to Prevent Than You Think",
    "News_text":"Viktoriya Skorikova\/ Getty Images\n\nAlthough it's true that dogs get heartworms more often than cats, heartworms in cats can be very dangerous and have limited treatment options. Feline heartworm disease is often overlooked and misunderstood.\n\nHere, we’ll cover the symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of heartworms in cats.\n\nThe parasite that causes heartworm disease in cats is the same parasite that causesheartworm disease in dogs—a worm calledDirofilaria immitis. In both dogs and cats, theparasitesare transmitted to the animal through the bite of an infected mosquito. However, the condition presents differently between dogs and cats.\n\nA few heartworms in a cat can cause more issues for a cat than dozens of heartworms in one dog. Cats can develop a very intense inflammatory reaction to the heartworms, especially when the worms die. In fact, even immature heartworms can cause significant damage to a cat’s lungs in the form of heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD). This disease can be fatal to cats.\n\nWhilecats who spend time outsidehave a higher risk of contracting heartworms, it only takes one infected mosquito to infect a cat. If a mosquito enters the home through open doors or windows, they can transmit the infection to your indoor cat. For this reason, indoor cats are still considered at risk of contracting heartworms. In fact, around 25% of cats that contract heartworms are considered indoor cats by their owners.\n\nHeartworms have been diagnosed in all fifty states and in all seasons of the year. Within the United States, the risk is greatest in the southeastern states, but more areas of the country see higher rates of infection each year. Though transmission is the greatest in warmer months, the risk of transmission never reaches zero.\n\nPet parents should keep in mind that wild animals often serve as reservoirs for heartworms. Mosquitos can pick up heartworms from stray dogs, coyotes, wolves, and foxes. You do not need to live somewhere with a high number of pet dogs for your cat to be at risk. Across the United States, approximately 15–17% of cats test positive for heartworm antibodies, meaning they have been exposed to the parasite.\n\nHeartworm symptoms run the full gamut, with some cats tolerating their infection without noticeable signs and others developing sudden, severe illness.\n\nIn cats who develop symptoms, the signs often first develop when immature adult heartworms reach the pulmonary artery, which carries blood from the heart to the lungs to get oxygenated. At this stage, signs often include coughing or difficulty breathing that's misdiagnosed asfeline asthmaorallergic bronchitis.\n\nSubtle symptoms of heartworm disease in cats include:\n\nCoughing\n\nWheezing\/asthma-like attacks\n\nOccasionalvomiting\n\nDecreased appetite\n\nWeight loss\n\nMore serious symptoms that can develop in cats with heartworm disease include:\n\nSudden collapse\n\nRespiratory distress\n\nDifficulty walking\n\nSeizures\n\nFluid in the abdomen\n\nWhen sudden, serious symptoms develop, the condition can be fatal. If your cat develops these heartworm symptoms, seek emergency attention.\n\nHeartworms cannot be diagnosed with a physical examination alone. However, in some cases, the veterinarian may detect a heart murmur in addition to the other clinical signs. Heart murmurs can occur with otherheart conditions, are not specific to heartworms.\n\nThe American Heartworm Society recommends yearly testing of cats for heartworms. While diagnosing heartworms in dogs is relatively straightforward, testing for cats is more complicated. Testing for heartworms in cats can include blood tests, chest X-rays, and echocardiography (i.e., ultrasound of the heart).\n\nIn cats, screening for heartworms should include two tests. Both tests require blood samples.\n\nAntigen tests:Dogs with mature heartworms can be diagnosed with a simple, 10-minute antigen test that only requires three drops of blood. This test detects the presence of mature female heartworms. In dogs, who usually have a high number of worms in one infection, false negatives are rare (as long as the worms have matured). In cats, who usually only have one to three adult worms that are sometimes all male worms, false negatives on the antigen test are more common. If a cat tests positive on an antigen test, it is usually around 5.5-8 months after the cat was initially infected. A cat's blood sample may be heated to make the antigen more readily detectable.\n\nAntibody tests:Antibody tests can be positive as soon as 2 months after a cat becomes infected with heartworms. One of the benefits of antibody tests is that they can detect both male and female heartworms. However, a cat will continue to test positive on antibody tests even if they have cleared the heartworm infection.\n\nChest X-rays can provide evidence that a cat may have heartworms and are important for monitoring the progression of the disease. Chest X-rays may show changes to the blood vessels and lung tissue. Echocardiography is useful for detecting physical changes to the heart. When a cat has adult heartworms, the worms may also be seen during the ultrasonographic examination.\n\nDue to the difficult nature of diagnosing heartworms, misdiagnosis is common. Tests may need to be repeated multiple times to detect the worms. The only ways to guarantee that a living cat has heartworms are to get a positive antigen test or to see heartworms during an echocardiogram.\n\nUnfortunately, treating heartworms is cats is quite difficult. Melarsomine, which is used to treat heartworms in dogs, is toxic to cats, even at low doses.\n\nInstead, treatments are aimed at managing heartworm symptoms and could include:\n\nPrednisolone: This steroid may relieve cough and other respiratory symptoms.\n\nDoxycycline: This antibiotic may weaken adult heartworms.\n\nFluticasone: This inhaled steroid may be used if the cat requires ongoing steroid therapy.\n\nCats who are in respiratory distress require emergency attention. Treatments for cats in respiratory distress may include:\n\nInjectable steroids\n\nInjectable bronchodilators\n\nOxygen therapy\n\nIntravenous fluids\n\nSurgical removal of adult heartworms may be an option at specialty veterinary hospitals. If the worms are removed, this may prevent the cat from experiencing the intense inflammatory reaction that occurs when a worm dies. But if a worm is torn or partially removed, the cat may have a severe and potentially fatal reaction.\n\nWhether they are an outdoor or indoor cat, all felines are at risk of contracting heartworms, especially if there are infected wild or domestic dogs in their area. For this reason, year-round heartworm prevention is recommended for all cats.\n\nDepending on your and your cat's preference, you can choose from both oral and topical preventatives. Most of these preventatives are given on a monthly basis, and a veterinary prescription is required to purchase them. Additionally, veterinarians may require that heartworm testing be performed prior to purchasing preventative.\n\nOther measures that pet parents can take to reduce risk of heartworms include:\n\nKeeping your cat indoors\n\nKeeping other household pets onpreventatives\n\nEliminating sources of standing water (where mosquitoes often breed)\n\nUsing pet-safe mosquito traps and sprays\/fogs that kill mosquitoes\n\nOf cats who test positive for heartworms, around 75–80% self-cure, while the others will succumb to the disease. Around 10% of cats with heartworms may experience sudden death. If your cat recovers, they may still experience long-term, asthma-like symptoms due to permanent damage that occurs to their lungs and blood vessels.\n\nIf your cat tests positive, speak with your veterinarian about how you can reduce their risk of severe symptoms through the use of steroids. Early detection may improve your cat's outcome. You can minimize risk through the use of heartworm preventatives and minimizing environmental risks.\n\nRead the original article onThe Spruce Pets",

    "News_text":"WHITE CLOUD, Mich. (WOOD) — Linda Carroll has fished the White River, not far below the White Cloud Dam, since she moved there 25 years ago. It’s great, she said, for small brown trout.\n\n“The river is what drew me up here,” she said Monday. “I like to fish. I love to be by the water. I’ve got a little bench down there I sit on. You can hear the water. It’s very tranquil.”\n\nAnd the water, she said, was crystal clear.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nAbout two weeks after the city started lowering the water level at the dam, the river downstream is brown with sediment and lined with thick goo. The state plans to test the water to make sure it’s not hurting fish.\n\n“I can’t see the fish,” Carroll said. “I can’t see the rocks to get in there to wade. You need to see where you’re going to fish.”\n\nDispute over dam dries up Lake White Cloud\n\nThe city-owned White Cloud Dam, first built 150 years ago, is one of two on the 89-mile long White River, which starts in northern Newaygo County and empties into Lake Michigan near Montague and Whitehall. It was rebuilt in 1990 after breaking during the flood of 1986.\n\nBut the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, deemed the dam unsafe and a potential risk to lives downstream. It recently threatened legal action and fines of up to $10,000 if the city refused to lower the water and ease the pressure.\n\nThe dam is among 160 in the state deemed in poor or unsatisfactory condition.\n\nLate last month, city crews started lowering the water level 1 foot per day, dropping it more than 5 feet.\n\nOn the backside of the dam, Lake White Cloud is nearly dry, with the river flowing through it. Lakefront properties are no longer lakefront. The city beach is empty.\n\n“All the neighborhood kids swim there, kids would swim there for years,” Carroll said. “That’s where they learned to swim. And there’s nothing else here for the kids to do.”\n\nMore than 8 miles downstream, Pam Driscoll walks down the wooden staircase from her home to the river.\n\n“Normally, it’s crystal clear,” she said.\n\nBut even this far from the dam, the river is brown and lined in spots with goo.\n\n“You can see it all along,” she said.\n\nDriscoll fears the cloudy water could harm wildlife.\n\n“There’s a lot of questions and a lot of concerns,” she said. “My big thing is if they’re going to be doing more and more dams, they’d better do it right. These are our waterways.”\n\nWarning of dam hazard, state to lower Hall Lake\n\nIn a telephone interview, a supervisor of EGLE’s Dam Safety Unit told Target 8 that the sediment had built up behind the dam for decades. Supervisor Lucas A. Trumble said the amount flowing downstream has led to a pause in the lowering of the dam, hoping that will allow the river to clear up. The city started lowering the water level June 27 and paused it July 3, Trumble said.\n\nThere’s still another 16 to 24 inches to drop, he said.\n\nHe said the river could take weeks to clear up.\n\nThe state will test the water Tuesday for turbidity and oxygen levels to make sure it’s not harming the fish, Trumble said.\n\n“EGLE doesn’t take this lightly,” Trumble said of the decision to lower the water levels. “This isn’t something we want to do. We need to protect folks downstream of the dam.”\n\nHe said a collapse of the dam would be catastrophic and could lead to loss of lives.\n\n“Eleven to 13 homes would be impacted by the failure of the dam,” he said.\n\nIn the meantime, some in town hope the city can restore the dam and the lake.\n\n“We don’t have $9 million to repair the dam, so we need a millionaire or somebody to step up and donate some money because our little town doesn’t have that kind of funding,” Carroll said.\n\nIn an email, White Cloud City Manager April Storms said her office has been inundated with calls and messages about the dam. A special City Council meeting is scheduled at 5 p.m. July 21.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_text":"LONDON (AP) — More than 14 million children did not receive a single vaccine last year — about the same number as the year before — according to U.N. health officials. Nine countries accounted for more than half of those unprotected children.\n\nIn their annual estimate of global vaccine coverage, released Tuesday, the World Health Organization and UNICEF said about 89% of children under 1 year old got a first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine in 2024, the same as in 2023. About 85% completed the three-dose series, up from 84% in 2023.\n\nOfficials acknowledged, however, that the collapse of international aid this year will make it more difficult to reduce the number of unprotected children. In January, U.S.President Trumpwithdrewthe country from the WHO, froze nearly all humanitarian aid and later moved to close theU.S. AID Agency. And last month,Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.said it was pulling the billions of dollars the U.S.had previously pledgedto the vaccines alliance Gavi, saying the group had “ignored the science.”\n\nKennedy, a longtimevaccine skeptic, has previously raised questions the diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine — which has proven to be safe and effective after years of study and real-world use. Vaccines prevent 3.5 million to 5 million deaths a year, according to U.N. estimates.\n\n“Drastic cuts in aid, coupled with misinformation about the safety of vaccines, threaten to unwind decades of progress,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nU.N. experts said that access to vaccines remained “deeply unequal” and that conflict and humanitarian crises quickly unraveled progress; Sudan had the lowest reported coverage against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. The data showed that nine countries accounted for 52% of all children who missed out on immunizations entirely: Nigeria, India, Sudan, Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Angola.\n\nWHO and UNICEF said coverage against measles rose slightly, with 76% of children worldwide receiving both vaccine doses. But experts say measles vaccine rates need to reach 95% to prevent outbreaks of the extremely contagious disease. WHO noted that 60 countries reported big measles outbreaks last year.\n\nThe U.S. is now having itsworst measles outbreakin more than three decades, while the disease has also surged acrossEurope, with 125,000 cases in 2024 — twice as many as the previous year, according to WHO.\n\nLast week, British authorities reported a child died of measles in a Liverpool hospital. Health officials said that despite years of efforts to raise awareness, only about 84% of children in the U.K. are protected.\n\n“It is hugely concerning, but not at all surprising, that we are continuing to see outbreaks of measles,” said Helen Bradford, a professor of children’s health at University College London. “The only way to stop measles spreading is with vaccination,” she said in a statement. “It is never too late to be vaccinated — even as an adult.”\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "News_title":"Martin Cruz Smith, best-selling author of 'Gorky Park,' dies at 82",
    "News_text":"Martin Cruz Smith, who transported readers behind the Iron Curtain in his multifaceted crime novel “Gorky Park,” a Soviet-era blockbuster that topped bestseller lists and kicked off a long-running book series about a canny Russian detective, died July 11 at a senior-living community in San Rafael, California. He was 82.\n\nHis death, from Parkinson’s disease, was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Simon & Schuster. Mr. Smith had just published “Hotel Ukraine,” the 11th and final installment in his Arkady Renko detective series, three days before he died. The novel featured his detective hero grappling with the usual concerns — official corruption, a brutal murder — as well as the same debilitating illness faced by Mr. Smith.\n\nRenko, Mr. Smith wrote, knew “he could stay at home, do nothing, and surrender as his symptoms got worse,” but refused to sit idly as his Parkinson’s progressed: “He was defined by who he was and what he could still do. Put that way, it wasn’t even a choice.”\n\nBy the time he wrote “Gorky Park” (1981), Mr. Smith had spent years toiling in obscurity, churning out paperback westerns, thrillers and suspense novels, most of them written under pseudonyms like Jake Logan and Simon Quinn. There were times,he said, when he could “only be accurately described as a schlockmeister.” How else to account for novels like “North to Dakota,” which “started off,” he remembered, “with the hero strangling a chimpanzee”?\n\nIn those days, Mr. Smith usually took six to eight weeks to finish a novel. But when he slowed down, as he did with “Gorky Park,” he wrote with a far more elegant and refined voice, crafting books that were admired for their psychological acuity, literary sophistication and rich depiction of faraway cultures (Russia’s, in particular) that few Americans knew firsthand.\n\nThe culmination of about eight years of work, “Gorky Park” was acclaimed as a masterpiece of the crime genre, impressing critics with its shrewd and incorruptible protagonist — a Russian Sam Spade — and its carefully drawn portrait of Soviet-era Moscow.\n\nThe book “reminds you just how satisfying a smoothly turned thriller can be,”wroteNew York Times reviewer Peter Andrews. In The Washington Post, former Moscow correspondent Peter Osnosdeclared that“Gorky Park” “is to ordinary suspense stories whatJohn le Carréis to spy novels. The action is gritty, the plot complicated, the overriding quality is intelligence.”\n\nIn broad strokes, the novel followed the contours of a classic work of crime fiction. A hard-bitten police investigator, Renko, is enlisted to solve a triple murder, with three mutilated bodies found in Moscow’s Gorky Park. The victims were shot at close range and had their finger tips and faces sliced off, concealing their identities.\n\nThe case took Renko around the world (including to Staten Island), even as Moscow remained the book’s gravitational center.\n\nFor many critics, Mr. Smith’s signature achievement was the way he conjured Russian society on the page, writing about apparatchiks and propagandists, the merits of vodka (there are two kinds, “good and very good”) and the relationship between ordinary street detectives and their counterparts in the KGB.\n\nImprobably, Mr. Smith spent no more than two weeks in the country in 1973, a decade before President Ronald Reagan denounced the Soviet Union as an “evil empire.” (Mr. Smith was denied a visa when he attempted to return.) He spoke no Russian and had no interpreter, although he took voluminous notes and made sketches of the sort of people and places he planned to write about.\n\n“More perhaps than any other recent work of American fiction,” Osnos wrote, “this one conveys a feeling for the Soviet Union, its capital, its moods and its people. … I spent weeks hanging around Soviet courtrooms and in Smith’s portrayals, I smell the musty aroma; I can see the faces; I can hear the voices.”\n\nThe novel won the Gold Dagger, a top honor from the Crime Writers’ Association of Britain, and was adapted into a 1983 Hollywood movie starringWilliam Hurt(attempting a Russian accent) as Renko.\n\n“I thought it was dreadful,” Mr. Smith said of the film.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, authorities condemned the novel in spite of its heroic Russian protagonist. The book was banned, although it found an audience thanks to dissidents and intellectuals who managed to distribute copies underground.\n\n“Even scientist and academician Andrei Sakharov was a big fan,” said Alex Levin, a Russian émigré who helped Mr. Smith with his research, ina 2005interview with the Guardian. “He enjoyed action books anyway, but this was the first American one he liked. That’s some compliment.”\n\nMr. Smith, a former journalist, said that he was driven by a desire to find out “what is happening in the Soviet Union.” His subsequent Renko novels used history as a backdrop, following the detective through the Soviet Union’s collapse (in “Red Square”), the Chechen War (“Stalin’s Ghost”) and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (“Hotel Ukraine”).\n\nOther installments invoked the Chernobyl nuclear disaster (“Wolves Eat Dogs”) and took inspiration from the 2006 assassination of Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian investigative journalist (“Tatiana”).\n\nTo research the books, Mr. Smith made return trips to Russia, traveled to Ukraine and Cuba, and spent three weeks aboard a Soviet factory ship in the Bering Sea. He was kicked off, he said, after the ship’s political officer located his name in a Soviet list of “foreign agents provocateurs to avoid.”\n\nMr. Smith went on to spend what hedescribed asan “endless” week on a U.S. trawler, “looking at the fog.” Still, he was happy to be conducting research in-person, later saying: “There are things you experience that are so basic that people just don’t tell you. It’s a little bit like people telling you about going to sea — nobody bothers to tell you that it is salty. They always overlook the details.”\n\nThe second of three children, Martin William Smith was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 3, 1942. He adopted his pseudonym, incorporating his maternal grandmother’s name, Cruz, after realizing there were a half-dozen other “Martin Smiths” trying to get published.\n\nHis father, who came from a Scottish Episcopal family, was a jazz saxophonist and photographer. His mother, a descendant of Pueblo and Yaqui Indians, was a former beauty queen and a nightclub singer, once billed as “Princess Louisa, the All-American Songbird.”\n\nThe family moved frequently before settling outside Philadelphia, where his father found a job at the Budd Co., a metal fabricator.\n\nMr. Smith, who was known as Bill, was educated at the nearby Germantown Academy. He was a poor student, in his telling, barely making it in to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied sociology before failing a statistics paper and switching to creative writing.\n\nAfter graduating in 1964, he spent a few years in journalism, with jobs at the Associated Press, a local television station and the Philadelphia Daily News. He also had a brief stint editing For Men Only, a New York-based men’s magazine that taught him the importance of brevity.\n\n“We wasted no words getting someone through a door; we couldn’t fool around with Henry Jamesian language,” he told the Guardian.\n\nBy 1970, Mr. Smith had started writing novels, including a work of speculative fiction, “The Indians Won,” that imagined the existence of a Native American state in the center of America. His other books included a series of thrillers about a Vatican hit man who, after dispatching his victims, dutifully goes to confession.\n\nAfter reading a Newsweek article about Soviet forensic scientists working to re-create the faces of murder victims, Mr. Smith began work on “Gorky Park.” The book was pitched to his publisher as a team-up story, featuring mismatched Soviet and American detectives who work together on a case.\n\nBut after his trip to Moscow, Mr. Smith decided to focus on the Russian and effectively dropped the American, to his publisher’s dismay. He spent years working to buy back the rights to the book, which he later resold to Random House in a reported $1 million deal. In the interim, he was supported by the proceeds from his 1977 novel “Nightwing,” a supernatural thriller involving vampire bats and Hopi Native American lore.\n\nMr. Smith married one of his college classmates, Emily Arnold, in 1968. “She was his first reader,” his children said in a statement, “and his moral touchstone.”\n\nSurvivors include his wife and three children, Nell Branco, Luisa Smith and Sam Smith; a brother; and five grandchildren.\n\nMr. Smith was a two-time winner of the Hammett Prize for crime fiction, awarded for his Victorian-era thriller “Rose” (1996), which he set in the mining country around Wigan, England, and “Havana Bay” (1999), in which Renko tracks a killer in Cuba. In 2019, he received the Grand Master Award from theMystery Writers of America.\n\n“By looking at the underworld you see how mainstream society works,” he told the Guardian, discussing his love of crime fiction. “You can travel through a social fracture and, for a limited amount of time, you can behave differently and ask whatever embarrassing questions you like.”",

    "News_title":"The Trump Administration Is About to Incinerate 500 Tons of Emergency Food",
    "News_text":"The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.Sign up for it here.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter.Sign up for it here.\n\nFive months into its unprecedented dismantling of foreign-aid programs, the Trump administration has given the order to incinerate food instead of sending it to people abroad who need it. Nearly 500 metric tons of emergency food—enough to feed about 1.5 million children for a week—are set to expire tomorrow, according to current and former government employees with direct knowledge of the rations. Within weeks, two of those sources told me, the food, meant for children in Afghanistan and Pakistan, will be ash. (The sources I spoke with for this story requested anonymity for fear of professional repercussions.)\n\nSometime near the end of the Biden administration, USAID spent about $800,000 on the high-energy biscuits, one current and one former employee at the agency told me. The biscuits, which cram in the nutritional needs of a child under 5, are a stopgap measure, often used in scenarios where people have lost their homes in a natural disaster or fled a war faster than aid groups could set up a kitchen to receive them. They were stored in a Dubai warehouse and intended to go to the children this year.\n\nSince January, when the Trump administration issued an executive order that halted virtually all American foreign assistance, federal workers have sent the new political leaders of USAID repeated requests to ship the biscuits while they were useful, according to the two USAID employees. USAID bought the biscuits intending to have the World Food Programme distribute them, and under previous circumstances, career staff could have handed off the biscuits to the United Nations agency on their own. But since Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency disbanded USAID and the State Department subsumed the agency, no money or aid items can move without the approval of the new heads of American foreign assistance, several current and former USAID employees told me. From January to mid-April, the responsibility rested with Pete Marocco, who worked across multiple agencies during the first Trump administration; then it passed to Jeremy Lewin, a law-school graduate in his 20s who was originally installed by DOGE and now has appointments at both USAID and State. Two of the USAID employees told me that staffers who sent the memos requesting approval to move the food never got a response and did not know whether Marocco or Lewin ever received them. (The State Department did not answer my questions about why the food was never distributed.)\n\nIn May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told representatives on the House Appropriations Committee that he would ensure that food aid would reach its intended recipients before spoiling. But by then, the order to incinerate the biscuits (which I later reviewed) had already been sent. Rubio has insisted that the administration embraces America’s responsibility to continue saving foreign lives, including through food aid. But in April, according toNPR, the U.S. government eliminated all humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Yemen, where, the State Department said at the time, providing food risks benefiting terrorists. (The State Department has offered no similar justification for pulling aid to Pakistan.) Even if the administration was unwilling to send the biscuits to the originally intended countries, other places—Sudan, say, where war is fueling the world’s worst famine in decades—could have benefited. Instead, the biscuits in the Dubai warehouse continue to approach their expiration date, after which their vitamin and fat content will begin to deteriorate rapidly. At this point, United Arab Emirates policy prevents the biscuits from even being repurposed as animal feed.\n\nOver the coming weeks, the food will be destroyed at a cost of $130,000 to American taxpayers (on top of the $800,000 used to purchase the biscuits), according to current and former federal aid workers I spoke with. One current USAID staffer told me he’d never seen anywhere near this many biscuits trashed over his decades working in American foreign aid. Sometimes food isn’t stored properly in warehouses, or a flood or a terrorist group complicates deliveries; that might result in, at most, a few dozen tons of fortified foods being lost in a given year. But several of the aid workers I spoke with reiterated that they have never before seen the U.S. government simply give up on food that could have been put to good use.\n\nThe emergency biscuits slated for destruction represent only a small fraction of America’s typical annual investment in food aid. In fiscal year 2023, USAID purchased more than 1 million metric tons of food from U.S. producers. But the collapse of American foreign aid raises the stakes of every loss. Typically, the biscuits are the first thing that World Food Programme workers hand to Afghan families who are being forced out of Pakistan and back to their home country, which has been plagued by severe child malnutrition for years. Now the WFP can support only one of every 10 Afghans who are in urgent need of food assistance. The WFP projects that, globally, 58 million people are at risk for extreme hunger or starvation because this year, it lacks the money to feed them. Based on calculations from one of the current USAID employees I spoke with, the food marked for destruction could have met the nutritional needs of every child facing acute food insecurity in Gaza for a week.\n\nDespite the administration’s repeated promises to continue food aid, and Rubio’s testimony that he would not allow existing food to go to waste, even more food could soon expire. Hundreds of thousands of boxes of emergency food pastes, also already purchased, are currently collecting dust in American warehouses. According to USAID inventory lists from January, more than 60,000 metric tons of food—much of it grown in America, and all already purchased by the U.S. government—were then sitting in warehouses across the world. That included 36,000 pounds of peas, oil, and cereal, which were stored in Djibouti and intended for distribution in Sudan and other countries in the Horn of Africa. A former senior official at USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance told me that, by the time she’d left her job earlier this month, very little of the food seemed to have moved; one of the current USAID employees I spoke with confirmed her impression, though he noted that, in recent weeks, small shipments have begun leaving the Djibouti warehouse.\n\n[Read: ‘In three months, half of them will be dead’]\n\nSuch operations are more difficult for USAID to manage today than they were last year because many of the humanitarian workers and supply-chain experts who once coordinated the movement of American-grown food to hungry people around the world no longer have their jobs. Last month, the CEOs of the two American companies that make another kind of emergency food formalnourished childrenboth toldThe New York Timesthat the government seemed unsure of how to ship the food it had already purchased. Nor, they told me, have they received any new orders. (A State Department spokesperson told me that the department had recently approved additional purchases, but both CEOs told me they have yet to receive the orders. The State Department has not responded to further questions about these purchases.) But even if the Trump administration decides tomorrow to buy more food aid—or simply distribute what the government already owns while the food is still useful—it may no longer have the capacity to make sure anyone receives it.\n\nArticle originally published atThe Atlantic",

    "News_text":"An appeals courttemporarily blockedthe Trump administration from revoking deportation protections and work permits for thousands of people from Afghanistan.\n\nThe administrationhad planned to endtemporary protected status for Afghanistan on Monday, part of a broader push to cut back a program that gives migrants reprieve from deportation if their home country is deemed unsafe. The administration argues those protections aren't meant to be permanent and Afghanistan's security situation has improved, though opponents say the countryremains unsafeand revocation would force people to uproot their lives.\n\nBut in a late-night ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuitblockedthe administration from putting into place its withdrawal of temporary protected status for one week. The court's administrative stay didn't weigh in on the merits of the case, instead giving the administration and CASA — a group that sued the government over its policy — time to file briefs.\n\n\"We are pleased with the Fourth Circuit's decision to temporarily pause the termination of TPS for Afghanistan,\" CASA legal director Ama Frimpong said in a statement, adding the group will push for a longer-term pause. \"Although temporary, every moment counts when it comes to families figuring out their futures and being protected from ICE's terror.\"\n\nAfghanEvac, a nonprofit thathas helped relocate Afghans, told CBS News the ruling \"offers a brief but critical window of relief.\"\n\n\"TPS has been a vital lifeline for tens of thousands of Afghans who supported U.S. missions or fled Taliban persecution. Ending it would not only uproot families and destabilize communities, it would betray a promise we made,\" AfghanEvac President Shawn VanDiver said in an email. \"We are heartened by the court's stay, but this isn't a victory—it's a pause. And it underscores the need for permanent protections, not political whiplash every few months.\"\n\nThe White House criticized the ruling.\n\n\"Once again, a rogue judge is trying to infringe on the separation of powers and impede the Trump administration's rightful ability to carry out its immigration policy. Temporary Protective Status is meant to be 'temporary' in nature. We look forward to ultimate victory on the issue,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the ruling \"ignores the President's clear authorities under both Article II of the Constitution and the plain language of federal law.\"\n\n\"Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was never intended to be a de facto asylum program, yet it has been abused as one for decades,\" McLaughlin said. \"The Trump administration is restoring integrity to our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\"\n\nSome 11,700 Afghans are enrolled in temporary protected status, or TPS,according to federal estimates. The program was extended for Afghanistan in 2023, under the Biden administration, which cited a \"deepening humanitarian crisis\" and \"economic collapse\" in Afghanistan since the U.S. military's 2021 withdrawal led the Taliban to retake the country.\n\nThe program is separate from the more permanent \"special immigrant visas\" issued to Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, often as translators. And migrants enrolled in TPS can apply forother formsof relief, includingasylum.\n\nTPS for Afghanistan was set to expire in May of this year unless the Trump administration chose to extend it again. Two months ago, DHS announced it would end the program in mid-July, saying the administration was \"returning TPS to its original temporary intent.\"\n\n\"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent[s] them from returning to their home country,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.\n\nCASAsuedNoem over the decision. The group argued the government had not followed the right procedure to end TPS, and alleged the decision wasn't motivated by whether Afghans still qualified for protection, but instead was \"part of the Trump Administration's broader effort to reduce the number of nonwhite immigrants in this country.\"\n\nThe government pushed back on the lawsuit,writing that Noemhas \"broad discretion\" over which countries qualify for TPS, and arguing the court shouldn't intervene because the protections are only meant to be temporary.\n\nLast week, a federal judgedeniedDHS's request to dismiss the lawsuit, but also denied CASA's motion to halt the administration's policy. CASA appealed that ruling, and on Monday, an appellate court put the revocation of TPS on hold while it considers the case.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to wind down TPS for scores of other countries, impacting hundreds of thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti, Cameroon and Afghanistan. The program had been expanded by former President Joe Biden, but President Trump has shifted to a more hardline stance on immigration.\n\nThe TPS rollback has drawn some lawsuits, but in May, the Supreme Courtallowed the Trump administrationto end TPS for Venezuelan migrants while the legal battles continue.\n\nTrump pushes senators to make $9.4 trillion in spending cuts\n\nChild rescued after getting stuck in claw machine\n\nFight over fluoride in water continues, despite warnings from dentists",

    "News_text":"\"Hyperbitcoinization\" — an almost apocalyptic term evoking end-of-days fiat collapse and bitcoin’s parabolic rise to global reserve status — is increasingly being discussed in more serious circles.\n\nFor hardcore bitcoin maximalists, it's long been the ultimate scenario: a financial utopia where individuals, institutions and even nations are all-in on a bitcoin-only system as the fiat-based economy collapses.\n\nWhile we aren't there yet, the recent events might suggest something is brewing.\n\nBitcoin is trading atrecord highsabove$119,000. The market cap of bitcoin isnear that of the tech giants. The U.S. dollar is continuing its slow bleed in real purchasing power. Major institutions are allocating capital to BTC with the same risk-adjusted lens they apply to traditional assets. If hyperbitcoinization once sounded like ideological fiction, it’s now likely approaching early-stage reality.\n\n\"In prior BTC bull markets, the hyperbitcoinization thesis would have been limited to crypto enthusiasts. More recently, hyperbitcoinization-adjacent conversations have become much more palatable for the broader public,\" FRNT Capital said in an emailed note.\n\nJust a few years ago, no one thought the likes of BlackRock would be creating an exchange-traded fund for the masses to buy billions in bitcoin.\n\nToday, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a juggernaut with 706,008 bitcoin under its belt, worth $82 billion, according toBitcoinTreasuries.Net data.\n\nLarge companies are raising funds to buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. Political leaders, including a pro-crypto U.S. president, are floating the idea of national bitcoin reserves (whether that willcome to fruitionis still up for debate).\n\nEven a U.S. housing regulator isconsideringwhether crypto holdings could be considered for mortgage applications — a potential signal that digital assets are becoming part of core financial infrastructure, or at least that those currently in power would like to see that happen.\n\nAnd of course, Wall Streethas already claimed bitcoinwith \"Tradification\" of the digital assets.\n\nThe chart below makes an interesting observation about a potential \"hyperbitcoinization\" that may already be well underway.\n\nFrom 2014 till at least 2020, bitcoin has been held by mostly individuals. But fast forward to today, a massive number of companies, funds and even governments, as opposed to individual crypto enthusiasts, are holders of bitcoin while prices continue to rally to new highs.\n\nThis shift in wallet distribution suggests that hyperbitcoinization, while not fully realized, is progressing from an ideological thesis to a potential observable market behavior.\n\nIn a market that is increasingly driven by narrative momentum and liquidity rotation, hyperbitcoinization may not just be a theme — it might become the trade.\n\n\"Conceivably, as the hyperbitcoinization thesis is validated in practice and gains further mainstream attention, more BTC investors will be motivated to HODL. This does not apply just to individuals, but to institutions and nations alike,\" said FRNT.",

    "News_title":"Two sworn enemies unite against Putin",
    "News_text":"The collapse of relations between Russia and Azerbaijan came in a series of quick-fire blows.\n\nIt began with the arrest of seven nationals from the former Soviet republic last month in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg.\n\nThey were held as part of an investigation by Moscow into mafia-style killings dating back 25 years.\n\nWithin days, two suspects – both ethnic Azerbaijanis – died in custody. Others appeared in court visibly bruised and beaten.\n\nAzerbaijan responded with fury. Russian cultural events were cancelled, the Baku bureau of the Kremlin-owned Sputnik news agency was raided, and a group of Russian IT workers was arrested and accused of drug-trafficking and cybercrime.\n\nThen came the threat, on Russian state TV, that Baku could be “taken in three days”, echoing rhetoric used before the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWar is unlikely. But the rift is real – and dangerous for Moscow because Armenia, after fighting a series of brutal wars with Azerbaijan over 30 years,is aligning with its old enemyto push Putin out of the South Caucasus.\n\nOn July 10, Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s president, met Nikol Pashinyan, the prime minister of Armenia.\n\nTheir direct talks focused onthe so-called “Zangezur Corridor”, a proposed route linking Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave via southern Armenia.\n\nThe corridor, including the terminology used to describe it, has long been a point of contention between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe corridor would fulfil a pan-Turkic dream of physically connecting Azerbaijan with Turkey and would form part ofthe “Middle Corridor” trade routefrom China and Central Asia to Europe.\n\nUnder the 2020 ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the route was to be monitored by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).\n\nBut that arrangement is now under threat, with Mr Aliyev wanting to cut Moscow out of the deal and have it fully under Azerbaijani control.\n\n“This is Russia’s last big card in the region,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\n\n“It allows them to control trade routes and leverage relationships with both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Losing it would be a major blow.”\n\nAlthough the talks on July 10 were inconclusive, momentum is shifting.\n\nMr Pashinyan visitedRecep Tayyip Erdo&gbreve;an, the president of Turkey, in Istanbul last month, a significant meeting given Armenia and Turkey have no formal diplomatic ties.\n\nAfterwards, Mr Erdo&gbreve;an said Armenia was showing a “more flexible approach” to the Zangezur Corridor, despite having previously opposed it.\n\nThe West, meanwhile, has floated the idea of putting the route under neutral international control, such as a Swiss or American firm, effectively excluding Russia altogether.\n\nLike Azerbaijan’s, Armenia’s ties with Moscow have frayed – especially since 2023, when Russian peacekeepers largely stood aside during Baku’slightning offensive to retake the Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\nNearly the entire Armenian population fled, and Azerbaijan was accused of ethnic cleansing.\n\nSince then Mr Pashinyan has leaned towards the West and sought reconciliation with Baku, believing that Armenia’s long-term future is threatened if it maintains hostile relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey.\n\nThis is far from popular in Armenia. Mr Pashinyan has one of the lowest approval ratings of any leader in the world and a recent spat with the Armenian Apostolic Church saw two archbishops arrested on charges of plotting against the government.\n\nHowever, Nurlan Aliyev, a senior researcher at the College of Europe, said Mr Pashinyan’s geopolitical reshuffling has pushed Baku and Yerevan together regarding their position on Russia.\n\nMr Aliyev said: “Both countries understand that they need tocreate a South Caucasus security architecturewithout Russian participation, one that regional states will support themselves.\n\n“We have not yet seen a final peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, but there are positive signs. A final peace agreement would be a major blow to Russia’s position in the South Caucasus.”\n\nFor the president of Azerbaijan, the days of taking orders from Moscow appear to be over. Analysts say he is using the Yekaterinburg incident to not just demand justice, but to assert independence.\n\n“The problem in relations with Baku is serious,” a former high-ranking Russian diplomat told The Telegraph. “President Aliyev bared his teeth, as any authoritarian leader would. He now sees himself as a triumphant figure. Moscow no longer dictates terms.”\n\nBashir Kitachayev of the Carnegie Centre in Berlin said Baku is taking advantage of the incident to push back against Moscow.\n\n“The deaths of two Azerbaijanis in Yekaterinburg served merely as a convenient pretext,” he said. “They [the Azerbaijani authorities] are using the situation to bolster their position at home and abroad by escalating tensions with Moscow.”\n\nThe shift was underlined by a publicised call between Mr Aliyev and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, in which they discussed forming closer ties.\n\nIt was a pointed signal from Azerbaijan, a country long seen as aligned with Moscow.\n\nThe Kremlin, meanwhile, is trying to reframe the standoff as a Western plot.\n\n“The scriptwriter and conductor of disagreements with Azerbaijan is located outside the post-Soviet space,” said Grigory Karasin, chairman of Russia’s international affairs committee.\n\nVladimir Dzhabarov, a Russian senator and former KGB officer, went further by accusing MI6 and Turkey of stirring unrest.\n\nIn truth, the cracks began long before Yekaterinburg.\n\nLast Christmas, Russia mistakenlyshot down an Azerbaijan Airlines jet. Baku refused to move past the incident, ultimately forcing Putin to apologise and offer compensation, in a rare diplomatic climbdown.\n\nNow fully aware of thepower of public confrontation, Baku did not hesitate to retaliate in the wake of the arrests in Yekaterinburg.\n\nThe fallout also threatens Russia’s prized North-South Corridor – a trade route linking Moscow to Iran and India that runs through Azerbaijan.\n\nLosing access to the corridor could deliver a real economic blow, especially as Russia seeks ways to get around Western sanctions.\n\nArkady Dubnov, a post-Soviet affairs expert, wrote on Telegram that Moscow’s main concern was preserving that corridor.

    "News_title":"Starmer’s claim that he’s tackling immigration now looks more ridiculous than ever",
    "News_text":"Why precisely is it that, over the past two decades, the UK has imported so many millions of foreign workers? Supposedly it’s because our country has severe “skills shortages”. Personally, though, I have my doubts. Especially now that this newspaper has uneartheda list of the occupations that immigrants can cite when applying for “skilled work visas”.\n\nAnd among them, believe it or not, is “poet”.\n\nNow, it may well be true that our country no longer produces great poets of her own. Even so, I’d be surprised if many British employers have been anxiously petitioningYvette Cooperto allow in more poets from abroad.\n\n“Honestly, Home Secretary, we’d love to hire homegrown poets. Sadly, though, British workers nowadays are just too lazy and entitled to master iambic tetrameter. They’d rather sit at home claiming benefits than get up at 6am to do an honest day’s graft on a villanelle or a rondeau redoublé. That’s why we urgently need to recruit thousands of hard-working young poets from Poland, Pakistan and Somalia. Otherwise, this country’s Petrarchan sonnet industry will collapse.”\n\nEven more surprising, however, is another job on the “skilled visa” list. It’s “diversity and inclusion expert”.\n\nIf there is one line of work in which Britain does not face even the faintest hint of a skills shortage, surely to goodness it’s“diversity and inclusion”. Every single year, without fail, our universities turn out hundreds of thousands of expertly brainwashed, virtue-signalling woke ideologues. That’s easily enough to staff the nation’s HR departments. So why on earth should we allow foreigners to come over here and steal these jobs inDEI, when our own deranged Left-wing fanatics could be doing them?\n\nStill, perhaps some good will come of this farce. The middle-class Left may finally turn against mass immigration, now it’s putting their own jobs at risk.\n\nReaders have long grown wearily inured to the dismal sight of trigger warnings on books that contain politically incorrect language. Even so, the one appended to a new novel entitledMen in Lovemerits special attention. Because, despite stiff competition, it must be the single most pointless trigger warning ever written.\n\n“As a novel set in the 1980s,” it reads, “many of the characters inMen in Love, as in society in general, express themselves in ways that we now consider offensive and discriminatory.” The warning then hastily reassures us that the author’s use of such hurtful language is not “an endorsement” of it – it’s merely his “attempt to authentically replicate” the way that all too many people used to speak in those shamefully unenlightened times.\n\nAt first glance, the above may seem no worse than any other trigger warning. But what makes this one so outstandingly imbecilic is thatMen in Lovehappens to be byIrvine Welsh. Indeed, it’s a sequel toTrainspotting– his bestselling 1993 novel about the harrowing misadventures of a group of Scottish heroin addicts.\n\nBearing this in mind, I’d love to know who exactly the trigger warning is intended to appease.Men in Love’s publishers, it would seem, believe that Mr Welsh has readers who will happily lap up graphic depictions of drug abuse, violence, underage sex and dead babies – and yet be horrified by the occasional scrap of sexist dialogue.\n\nGod only knows what sort of complaints they expected to receive, if they didn’t add the trigger warning.\n\n“Dear Sirs,\n\n“For the past three decades I have been an avid reader of your esteemed author Mr Irvine Welsh. With unalloyed pleasure I devouredFilth, his charming 1998 tale of a psychopathic, cocaine-snorting, sexually abusive police officer with a talking tapeworm. I equally adoredPorno, his joyful 2002 romp about a gang of thugs attempting to produce a pornographic video. And, like millions of other cinema-goers, I delighted in the 1996 film adaptation ofTrainspotting– thanks not least to that splendid scene in which a gentleman with diarrhoea explosively fouls the bedsheets of his young lady companion, and then accidentally sprays the sheets’ contents all over her parents while they’re eating breakfast.\n\n“You will surely understand my disgust, therefore, when I opened Mr Welsh’s latest novelMen in Love– only to discover that one of the characters refers to a woman living with obesity as ‘a fat lassie’.\n\n“Needless to say, I was shocked and appalled. Never in all my years of reading Mr Welsh did I imagine that he would stoop to writing something so unspeakably offensive.\n\n“Please inform this sickening lout that, unless he makes his cast of violent working-class Scottish smackheads start talking like a panel ofGuardiancolumnists discussing gender equality at the Hay Festival, I shall never read another word he writes.”\n\nWay of the Worldis a twice-weekly satirical look at the headlines aiming to mock the absurdities of the modern world.

    "News_title":"October 7 probe: 35 Hamas terrorists overran Mop Darom base, led to collapse of camp's defense",
    "News_text":"The investigation concluded that the tenacity and courage of the soldiers and commanders from the Golani Brigade, and reinforcements who arrived to assist, were noteworthy.\n\nThe IDF on Tuesday released its findings from an investigation into the fierce battle that took place at the Mop Darom base (Negev Research and Development Center), near Nir Oz in the Eshkol Regional Council, during theOctober 7 massacre.\n\nThe investigation paints a complex picture: a surprise attack by at least 35 terrorists led to the collapse of the camp’s defense systems and the temporary capture of the facility by Hamas. Poor positioning and inadequate protection were exploited, allowing terrorists to gain control of key areas.\n\nHowever, the report highlights the high level of readiness shown by theGolani Brigade, alongside the bravery of the soldiers and commanders. Despite suffering casualties, they displayed exceptional determination and led from the front.\n\nThe investigation concluded that the tenacity and courage of the soldiers, commanders, and reinforcements who arrived to assist were noteworthy. Their leadership throughout the battle, especially after the injury and death of the platoon commander, who led with distinction, was deserving of special commendation.\n\nAt least 35 terrorists infiltrated the camp, and 10 of them were killed by IDF forces during the fighting. Prior to the attack, Golani’s 51st Brigade had been stationed at the camp.\n\nAt 5:30 a.m., the brigade prepared for \"dawn readiness\" according to the orders and situation assessment at the time. An hour later, at 6:29 a.m.,Hamas launched a large-scale attackon southern Israel, with terrorists infiltrating through multiple routes by vehicles, motorcycles, and on foot. Within minutes, the brigade soldiers were facing an organized assault, with the enemy holding a significant numerical advantage.\n\n06:29 – As red alert warnings of rockets sounded, the soldiers and platoon commanders moved into protected areas. Most entered the company’s dining hall, while others sought shelter in bunkers and the command post. Several mortar shells and drones exploded inside the camp during this time.\n\n06:31 – Reports from the lookout indicated the infiltration of over 100 terrorists across 10 entry points in the camp.\n\n06:35 – Despite lookout reports of increasing terrorist activity, a battalion operations officer assured in a WhatsApp group that everything inside the camp was operational. Meanwhile, IDF forces at a lookout point saw 20 terrorists on motorcycles approaching the camp.\n\n06:47 – Dozens of terrorists infiltrated the camp through openings in the armored vehicle gate and main entrance.\n\n07:00 – Upon realizing most of the soldiers were inside the dining hall, the terrorists began firing at them using small arms, shoulder-fired missiles, and machine guns, and throwing grenades. Simultaneously, fighting broke out between terrorists and soldiers who were inside the bunkers and the command post.\n\nTwo commanders, Captain Shilo Rauchberger and the platoon commander, ordered soldiers in the dining hall to defend both the front and back entry points. This critical decision prevented a massacre in the dining hall and led to a prolonged battle lasting for approximately three hours.\n\n07:15 – Terrorists continued their intense fire, attempting to break into the dining hall by throwing grenades and starting fires. Despite the heavy assault, the soldiers, including Rauchberger, fought valiantly from inside.\n\nDuring the battle, an unknown number of terrorists were killed, and others were repelled. Seventeen soldiers, including both officers and enlisted personnel, were injured, but they continued to fight until they required medical attention.\n\n07:30 – The platoon commander and another soldier stopped an infiltration attempt at the back entrance, despite being hit by a shoulder-fired missile. The platoon commander, though injured, continued to lead the defense.\n\nSimultaneously, Sergeant Amichay Rubin was seriously injured while blocking the main entrance alongside Captain Rauchberger. Rubin succumbed to his injuries three days later. Rauchberger continued fighting until his own injuries took their toll, and he was killed. Sergeant Shlomo Reshetnikov, a lone soldier who immigrated from Russia, was also killed while defending the dining hall.\n\nWhile the fighting unfolded in the dining hall, terrorists targeted nearby bunkers, attempting to breach the doors with shoulder missiles, explosives, and gunfire. The soldiers inside repelled the attacks, using their bodies to block the doors.\n\n08:15 – The terrorists planted explosives on the south bunker door. Sergeant Dvir Haim Resler was killed while holding the door, preventing the terrorists from breaching it and saving the lives of two other soldiers. The explosion damaged the locking mechanism, but the terrorists ultimately withdrew.\n\n09:00 – A five-soldier patrol vehicle arrived and found no terrorists inside the camp. They rescued two soldiers from the north bunker and conducted a search of the facility.\n\nBy evening, a special entry kit was used to open the damaged south bunker door. The force commander set up a casualty evacuation point and organized the remaining uninjured soldiers into medical and security teams.\n\nThe terrorists withdrew from the camp, setting up ambushes along the access routes.\n\n13:51 – Four urgent casualties were evacuated on stretchers. On their way to the evacuation helicopter, the IDF forces came under fire from two points. Two soldiers were injured, but the forces returned fire. Two attack helicopters joined the communication network for support.\n\nThe platoon commander, hearing the bursts of gunfire, instructed his team to return fire and maneuver toward the camp to flank the terrorists. The helicopters engaged the terrorists but were unaware of the platoon commander’s force.\n\n14:03 – The platoon force identified three terrorists at a range of 50-70 meters, killed them, and continued fighting. Four additional terrorists were killed by forces in APC (armored personnel carrier) positions.\n\n14:15 – The attack helicopters ceased fire after identifying the platoon commander’s force.\n\n15:40 – An evacuation helicopter landed and evacuated five injured soldiers.\n\n17:00 – The platoon commander coordinated with the formerGolani Brigadecommander and arranged for reconnaissance teams to protect surrounding settlements.\n\n19:00 – Another helicopter evacuated the remaining casualties.\n\n21:00 – Reinforcements arrived and reinforced the camp’s defenses, enabling the platoon to organize for further operations.\n\nThe enemy’s attack, which included heavy fire and multiple infiltration points, neutralized the camp’s defenses and pinned down the defending force for several hours. Despite lookout reports of infiltrations across several sectors, the defense forces inside were unable to assist the surrounding settlements in time. The camp’s vulnerability was compounded by poor location, inadequate preparation, and a collapsed defense posture.\n\nDespite these challenges, the soldiers’ bravery and tactical decisions significantly reduced the number of casualties. The actions of commanders, soldiers, and reinforcements, who fought even after being injured, saved many lives and prevented terrorists from entering vital areas like the dining hall and bunkers.\n\nSpecial recognition must be given to the tactical college officer who arrived and assumed command, saving lives and ensuring the continued function of the camp’s forces. The air forces also conducted life-saving evacuations under fire, demonstrating professionalism and coordination with ground forces.\n\nUltimately, the lack of prior warning and the camp’s unpreparedness contributed to its initial collapse. However, the courage of those who fought, led by the commanders, was pivotal in turning the tide of battle.",

    "News_text":"By Christoph Steitz, Emma Rumney and Maggie Fick\n\nFRANKFURT\/LONDON (Reuters) -European firms called on trade negotiators to redouble efforts to strike a deal with Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened a 30% tariff on EU imports from August, though firms were avoiding panic, holding out hope that Trump would back off his threats as he has in recent months.\n\nTrump on Saturday said he planned to impose higher tariff rates on imports from Mexico and the European Union beginning August 1, mounting pressure on Brussels to scramble for a deal to avert a potential massive blow to the bloc's economy, particularly exporters in the automotive, pharmaceutical and consumer industries. The U.S.-EU trade partnership came to $975.9 billion of two-way goods trade last year, USTR data show.\n\nAnalysts said that firms were urging calm, with many expecting negotiations still to bear fruit ahead of the deadline. Trump has announced tariffs on numerous occasions only to revise his demands or push deadlines further into the future, giving rise to the so-called \"TACO\" trade in markets, which stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"\n\n\"Companies are starting to realize that this should not be panic-inducing,\" said Dan Hearsch, global co-leader for automotive and industrials at consultancy AlixPartners, adding firms weren't racing to tweak supply chains.\n\n\"Every automaker now has teams that are wired for this.\"\n\nStill, pain is becoming apparent across the business world. Volvo Car said it was currently unable to sell its ES90 profitably in the United States, and said it would take a $1.2 billion charge as a result. Shares fell 4.7%, leading European carmakers lower.\n\nCarmakers Volkswagen, Fiat-to-Jeep owner Stellantis, Renault, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche were all down around 1-2%.\n\n\"The escalating tariff conflict with the USA poses a serious threat to many German companies,\" said Volker Treier, head of trade at Germany's DIHK chamber of commerce, urging ministers to race ahead with talks.\n\n\"Instead of summer holidays, tough negotiations are now needed to avert a collapse of transatlantic trade.\"\n\nSome EU officials called the tariff plan \"prohibitive to any trade\" in its current form.\n\nThe threatened 30% tariff is \"separate from all sectoral tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, implying a 27.5% duty on autos, in effect since April, would still stand.\n\nThree pharmaceutical sector sources added the industry was withholding judgment after various recent tariff threats from 200% levies on pharmaceuticals to the new 30% EU-wide one.\n\n\"We have a tariffs task force that has been doing a lot of scenario planning,\" said one of the sources. \"We are in wait and see mode until something comes into force concretely.\"\n\nUNCERTAINTY\n\nEuropean companies called for clarity, quick solutions, and a refocus on regional industrial capacity.\n\n\"Both sides must try to reach a fair agreement by 1 August. We should act and not wage trade wars,\" said Wolfgang Große Entrup, Managing Director of German chemicals association VCI.\n\n\"However, the complicated talks also show that it is more important than ever to strengthen Europe as a centre of industry and to conclude further free trade agreements quickly.\"\n\nMercedes-Benz said in a statement that an agreement was \"crucial for the future economic success of both markets\" in Europe and the United States, and for parties involved to work \"intensively and as quickly as possible on a trade agreement.\"\n\nShares in other major European firms exposed to the United States were also largely down. Regional food makers said the 30% rate, if imposed, would be \"disastrous.\"\n\nPernod Ricard, maker of Jameson whiskey, was down 1.5%, while cognac maker Remy Cointreau sank 4%. Rival Diageo, where sales of Canadian whisky and Mexican tequila drive its U.S. business, bucked the trend, up over 0.5%.\n\nFrench luxury powerhouse LVMH dropped 1.5%, while consumer goods firm Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Reckitt Benckiser were down less than 1%.\n\n(Reporting by Christoph Steitz, Amir Orusov, Ilona Wissenbach, Anna Ringstrom, Marie Mannes, Maggie Fick, Patricia Weiss, Nick Carey and Emma Rumney; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Miranda Murray, Kirsten Donovan, Louise Heavens, Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)",

    "News_title":"The man who knows everything about Netanyahu: If Urich falls, everything comes crashing down",
    "News_text":"Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara has recommended indicting Prime Minister Netanyahu's advisor, Yonatan Urich, for leaking information to a German newspaper.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday lashed out atAttorney-GeneralGali Baharav-Miara's decision to recommend charging his close advisor, Yonatan Urich, for the leak of sensitive documents to the German tabloidBild.\n\n\"The decision to prosecute Urich is disastrous and raises questions,” Netanyahu said. “A disgraceful statement from the attorney-general. I know the details, and I say, he did not harm national security.\"\n\nDozens of people have worked in Netanyahu’s office over the cumulative 17 years he has served as prime minister. Advisors have come and gone. Some became state witnesses, including Nir Hefetz, Ari Harow, and Shlomo Filber (who signed as a state witness and later regretted it). Those who were not involved left the office in anger, but only a few left intact, without being indicted or harboring hard feelings.\n\nBut of all those who came and went, Netanyahu, a man devoid of emotion, who believed that everyone was born to serve him, truly loved and valued only two: Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer andYonatan Urich.\n\n“Urich and Dermer are like the sons Netanyahu wanted to have,” said a source who worked in the Prime Minister's Office for many years.\n\n\"He is a man who distrusts everyone and is paranoid that everyone wants to bring him down. But he trusts these two almost completely. They were exposed to nearly everything—they knew the secrets, the schemes, everything. Urich was aware of every political and media move. He was intimately familiar with every campaign, both official and unofficial, as well as every vendetta. Dermer is the de facto foreign minister, liaison to the US administration, and someone Netanyahu completely trusts on the most sensitive political and military matters.\"\n\nBut as the cliché goes, Netanyahu is like the sun: when you get too close, you burn.\n\nUrich began working with Netanyahu in 2015. Yoav Ben-Tzur, who worked with Netanyahu at the time, convinced him to join after Topaz Luk, who knew Urich from their service in theIDFSpokesperson’s Unit, recommended him. His skills quickly became apparent: a digital expert, Urich opened Netanyahu's eyes to the world of social networks. He charmed Netanyahu by giving him the ability to engage directly with the public on Facebook and later on Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, without having to use the media, which Netanyahu despised, as an intermediary.\n\nUrich is a very talented man: creative, sharp, and up-to-date. However, he is also unrestrained. He doesn’t see limitations. He initiated and navigated harsh campaigns against political rivals, with no red lines. Ask Benny Gantz: he could write a series of books about the nightmare he went through, especially during election periods when he was a real threat to Netanyahu’s rule; the prime minister’s propaganda machine - with Urich playing a central role - attacked Gantz, even below the belt.\n\nUrich’s entanglement didn’t begin yesterday, with the potential indictment for the leak to theBild. It started much earlier. On February 11, 2025, the prosecution decided to indict Urich, Ofer Golan, and Srulik Einhorn for harassing Shlomo Filber, the state witness inCases 1000, 2000, and 4000.\n\nAccording to the indictment, in 2019, the three conspired to harass Filber regarding his testimony in Case 4000. They rented a car with a loudspeaker system and sent two of their people to Filber’s home, where they were heard shouting things like: “Momo, be a man, go and tell the truth! What did they do to you to get you to go against the prime minister? What did they promise you? The left is using you to bring down Likud!” and more.\n\nThis, as mentioned, was Urish’s first noted involvement. The second came last night.\n\nIn a statement from the attorney-general's office, it was stated that “the State Prosecutor’s Office informed Yonatan Urich, the Prime Minister's close advisor, that the Attorney-General and State Prosecutor are considering indicting him for criminal charges, subject to a hearing, in the‘Bild’case on the grounds of security violations, including leaking classified information with intent to harm national security, possessing classified information, and destroying evidence.”\n\n“According to the allegations,\" continued the statement, \"Urich, together with Eli Feldstein, took highly classified information from the IDF’s systems that, if exposed by Urich, could have endangered national security and lives. The release of the classified information was intended, among other things, to influence public perception of the prime minister and skew the discourse regarding the murder of six hostages in August 2024.”\n\nMinutes after the statement, Urich's attorneys, Amit Hadad and Noa Milstein, responded: “Yonatan Urich denies all allegations against him. He never possessed or leaked classified information and certainly did not harm national security. This is an absurd set of allegations arriving at an inconvenient time, and his innocence will be proven beyond any doubt.”\n\nHowever, the third, most severe case for Urich is still pending: the Qatargate case.\n\nUrich is suspected of receiving payment from a Qatar-funded company to act from within the Prime Minister’s Office in order to advance Qatar’s interests, such as portraying it as a peace-seeking and dominant country, in contrast to Egypt.\n\nAccording to aHaaretzexposé, Urich worked for the Qatari government prior to the World Cup to improve its image, which had been criticized internationally for being a dictatorial state.\n\nThis is the biggest criminal case against Urich, and Netanyahu has gone to great lengths to help him.\n\nIn a video released of Netanyahu, the prime minister is seen nearly exploding with rage, saying: \"The police are conducting a political campaign against him. This is a political investigation, a political move. Other than that, there’s nothing. They are trying to prevent the firing of the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief. The investigation is intended to bring down a right-wing prime minister.\"\n\nUrich’s detention has been extended repeatedly. He was interrogated multiple times, placed under house arrest, and then returned to detention. The investigation has been ongoing for months. Netanyahu is angry. Beyond his personal concern and the lack of media presence, Netanyahu knows something else: Urich knows everything. Urich had been close to him for years, and it was not a good idea to anger him.\n\nTo avoid angering him and to show him that he’s not alone and that he has complete backing, senior staff from the PMO were sent to the detention extensions. Everyone showed up to ensure that Urich didn’t become a state witness against the boss.\n\nIn April, Nir Hefetz, Netanyahu's former communications advisor, said: \"Urich is the man who knows everything about Netanyahu. If this brick crumbles, the whole wall will collapse. Urich is a weak man, and Netanyahu knows exactly what he says to their mutual lawyer, Amit Hadad.\"\n\nHe added: \"Qatargate is the reason for the acceleration of the judicial overhaul in recent weeks: firing Ronen Bar, the process of ousting the attorney-general, and changing the makeup of the committee for selecting judges. Netanyahu is trying to stop the Qatargate investigation, and he knows why.\"\n\nAnd Urich? He remained silent. Recently released from house arrest, he occasionally tweeted, as usual, singing Netanyahu’s praises. He remains loyal, an admirer. From time to time, he sends media advice to the office, which is now left without him, professionally abandoned.\n\nSo, what will happen to Urich after the second indictment, pending the hearing? The answer is: nothing. It doesn’t bother Netanyahu. Urich is not a state employee; he is an independent contractor who submits invoices for his services. As long as Netanyahu remains in power, he will continue to employ him, regardless of whether there are two indictments or 10.\n\nLaw violations? Indictments? That hasn’t bothered Netanyahu in years. The only thing that matters to him is that Urich stays close, doesn’t speak against him, and most importantly, continues helping him. Because in the months he has been absent, anyone who understands communications within the office, in the surrounding environment, and in the system understands how crucial Urich was to the media activities in the most important office in the country.",

    "News_title":"Child Sex Abuse Lawsuits Cost California Schools Close to $3 Billion",
    "News_text":"This article was originally published inCalMatters.\n\nThis story was originally published byCalMatters.Sign upfor their newsletters.\n\nWhen Samantha Muñoz was a second grader at Fancher Creek Elementary in Clovis, her teacher told her she “wasn’t that bright” and needed extra help with schoolwork. He’d make her stay in the classroom at recess, or tell her to sit on his lap while other students were busy with assignments.\n\nDuring those quiet times in the classroom, she said, he sexually abused her — over and over, for at least a semester, even after the school principal walked in on him.\n\nGet stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.Sign up for The 74 Newsletter\n\n“No one knew. I just didn’t know who to run to. I ran to the school, and they shut me down into silence,” said Muñoz, who’s now 28. “But (now) I’ve figured, no one should be living like this. It’s time to speak your truth and make it OK to talk about. It’s a sensitive topic, but it needs awareness and closure.”\n\nMuñoz, who lives in Fresno County, is part of a multi-plaintiff lawsuit against the Clovis Unified School District alleging the district knew about Muñoz’s teacher but — for at least seven years, from 2005-2012 — did not stop him from abusing students. Clovis Unified had no comment on the case because of the litigation.\n\nMuñoz’s case is one of at least 1,000 lawsuits against California school districts and counties stemming fromAB 218, a sexual abuse reform law that took effect in 2020. It temporarily dropped the statute of limitations, provided a three-year window for victims to file claims and otherwise made it easier for them to sue school districts and counties.\n\nThe cases span decades, some as early as the 1940s. In many cases the perpetrator is dead, the district staff has turned over, and there’s no longer a paper trail of the original complaint, if there ever was one.\n\nThe new law has resulted in a slew of payouts to abuse survivors, most in the range of $5 million to $10 million but some much higher. In 2023 a jury delivered a $135 million verdict against Moreno Valley Unified in Riverside County. Los Angeles Unified is expecting to pay more than $500 million to settle a portion of its claims. Overall, the claims against schools total nearly $3 billion.\n\nCounties also have paid out large sums of money. In April, Los Angeles Countypaid $4 billionto settle 6,800 abuse claims from victims who were abused in foster care or in probation department facilities. Like many government entities, Los Angeles County is self-insured.\n\nThe settlements have been so large that they’ve brought some school districts to the brink of financial insolvency and state takeover. They’ve also resulted in steep spikes in insurance payments for all school districts, regardless of whether they’ve been sued.\n\nCarpinteria Unified is among those districts facing financial collapse.\n\nThe predominantly low-income Latino district near Santa Barbara has been served with four sexual abuse lawsuits, all involving the same perpetrator: a principal who wasconvicted in 1986 of abusing several boysin the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n“These suits are settling for $5 million to $10 million each, and we have a $42 million budget. You do the math,” said Superintendent Diana Rigby. “It’s untenable.”\n\nThe district has already spent $750,000 on legal fees, and has had to lay off staff, increase class sizes and cut field trips, enrichment activities and other programs to pay its legal bills. Although the district had insurance at the time of the abuse, the company has since gone out of business and its current insurance company won’t cover old claims.\n\nThe perpetrator is dead and the district staff has turned over 100% since the incidents occurred. Years ago, the district instituted strict protocols for abuse claims, immediately contacting the police and placing the alleged perpetrator on leave until an investigation is complete.\n\nRigby worries about how her district will survive. If the state takes it over, it’ll lose its school board and superintendent, and further cuts will be inevitable.\n\n“We believe all the victims need to be compensated for these heinous crimes,” Rigby said. “But AB 218 is causing current students and taxpayers to pay for crimes that happened 50 years ago, that they had nothing to do with. There has to be a better solution.”\n\nSeveral current bills in the Legislature would curb the law, at least somewhat. A bill by Sen. John Laird,SB 577, would bring back a statute of limitations, make it easier for districts to issue bonds to pay off settlements and take other steps to give some relief to school districts and other public agencies. But it doesn’t cap attorneys’ fees or settlements.\n\nThe political reality, Laird said, is that there’s not enough support in the Legislature to limit legal settlements in abuse cases.\n\n“We’re trying to walk between the poles of avoiding billions of dollars in settlements, while not neglecting the rights of victims,” said Laird, a Democrat from Santa Cruz.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate and is now in the Assembly judiciary committee.\n\nConsumer Attorneys of California is neutral on the bill, but several school lobbying groups have opposed it, saying it doesn’t go far enough. One group, the Association of California School Administrators, would also like to see school districts share responsibility for paying settlements with the perpetrator or other groups that might be involved, such as sports or after-school organizations. The group also wants the state to study the possibility of a victims’ fund that’s not entirely monetary; it could also include mental and physical health services.\n\nThe abuse settlements are the worst financial threat to school districts since the Great Recession of 2008-2009, said Mike Fine, director of the Fiscal Crisis Management and Assistance Team, which advises the state and school districts on financial matters.\n\nHisgroup is recommendingthat the state create a database of abuse claims as well as teachers who have been accused, to prevent perpetrators from bouncing from one district to another. The group also recommends more flexibility on settlement payment plans, and an alternative to state takeover for districts that are out of money.\n\nLike Laird, Fine’s group is not calling for a cap on settlements or attorney fees. “We didn’t think tort reform was within our scope,” Fine said.\n\nThey’re also not calling for a state-financed victims’ fund, something school districts have asked for. Laird said the state lacks the money for such a fund. Fine’s group omitted it from its recommendations because a victims’ fund could preclude a trial, and Fine said that victims should have a right to go to court and have their voices heard.\n\nBut schools’ top priority, Fine said, should be setting tough protocols to prevent abuse from happening in the first place. Although some districts have instituted safeguards, not all have, and the state doesn’t have a uniform policy because it’s deemed a local issue.\n\n“Schools have to hold themselves to a higher standard, and we’ve clearly failed in this regard,” Fine said. “This simply has to stop.”\n\nThe sexual abuse law has been a windfall for trial attorneys. Billboards seeking clients have cropped up around the state, and lawyers from throughout the country have come to California to file claims.\n\nTypically attorneys in abuse lawsuits work for free until there’s a resolution, and then collect a portion of the payout if the plaintiff prevails — in some instances up to 40%, depending on the complexity of the case.\n\nDorothy Johnson, legislative advocate for the Association of California School Administrators, called the current scenario “prime time” for trial attorneys in California, but forcing impossible burdens onto school districts and other agencies. Schools are already contending with financial hardships due to declining enrollment, the end of pandemic relief funds and federal education cuts. These settlements are pushing some districts over the edge — while attorneys are making millions, she said.\n\n“We don’t think trial attorneys should be profiting at the expense of current students,” Johnson said. “We want to make sure victims get resolution but at the same time put some guardrails up. Right now, there are no guardrails.”\n\nThe trial attorneys’ association is not opposed to changes in the law, as long as victims’ rights aren’t curtailed, said Nancy Peverini, legislative director for California Consumer Attorneys.\n\n“There’s an understanding that we need to find a balance, but it’s really important that survivors’ voices don’t get lost,” Peverini said.\n\nMontecito — a scenic enclave near Santa Barbara — is home to Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities. With sweeping views of the Pacific and Santa Ynez mountains, it’s one of the most affluent and exclusive towns in the country. Its school district, however, is facing financial calamity and a possible state takeover.\n\nMontecito Union Elementary District serves about 350 students, mostly children from affluent families but also the children of Montecito’s landscapers and housekeepers. Earlier this year, it took in 42 students from Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed in a wildfire.\n\nIn 2023, three former students sued the district over sexual abuse they said they experienced from 1972-76. The district denied the claim, and is negotiating a settlement. The payout and legal costs could swell to $20 million — more than the district’s annual budget. Even a state loan wouldn’t solve the problem, because the payments would be more than the district can afford, according to Fine’s organization.\n\nThe district’s insurance company at the time of the alleged abuse no longer exists, and its current insurer doesn’t cover events from that long ago. That means that like Carpinteria Unified, Montecito will have to pay the entire cost — cutting programs, borrowing money and using reserves.\n\n“First of all, there’s a whole lot of empathy. We were heartbroken to hear these allegations,” Superintendent Anthony Ranii said. “But none of us were here then. Many of us weren’t even born. The alleged perpetrator and witnesses are dead. We’re putting the responsibility for something that might or might not have happened in 1972 100% on the heads of students in 2025. That’s not fair.”\n\nFor Muñoz, the abuse she suffered during the 2004-05 school year took more than a decade to come to terms with. Even after the abuse stopped, Muñoz found school difficult, socially and academically. She lost trust in adults and emotionally withdrew. She never talked about what happened, not even to her family.\n\nNeng Yang, the teacher whom Muñoz said abused her, was arrested and tried in 2014 on 45 counts of sexual abuse on a child under age 10, based on testimony from numerous victims who were students at Fancher Creek Elementary. He wasconvictedand is serving a 38-year sentence.\n\nMuñoz only started talking about the abuse a few years ago, when she started reading about the impacts of childhood abuse. Earlier this year, she got a call from Pfau Cochran Vertetis Amala, a Washington-based law firm, that was investigating claims from another of Yang’s victims for a potential suit against Clovis Unified.\n\nShe decided to share her story with the attorneys and join the lawsuit.\n\n“I just want other victims to know that they’re not the only ones,” Muñoz said. “It’s OK to talk about it. We need awareness if there’s going to be change.”\n\nThis article wasoriginally published on CalMattersand was republished under theCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivativeslicense.",

    "News_title":"It’s time to admit that the founding principles of the NHS are ludicrous in modern Britain",
    "News_text":"Easily the most depressing aspect of watching and writing about politics for more than 40 years has been to witness the abject short-termism of its practitioners. In no area of public life is this more evident than the NHS.\n\nPoliticians have watched its slow immolation in the full knowledge that something fundamental must be done to avert its collapse. They refuse to countenance anything that might necessitate an inevitably fractious campaign to put the case for reform to the country.\n\nThe point is that it takes time, often decades, to change opinion about an institution so deeply rooted in national life and culture.Throughout the years of the NHS’s declineour politicians have rejected any suggestion that the way it is funded – almost entirely from taxes – might be its central flaw.\n\nWe all know the history. Founded in the aftermath of the Second World War by a Labour government determined to socialise the entire country, it was set up along the lines of a nationalised industry. It was designed to equalise access and minimise personal costs but not maximise performance.\n\nThe founding principle that treatment should be free at the point of delivery has become a shibboleth that no-one in public life dares to challenge unless they wish to invite ostracism. Nigel Farage tried to open a debate along these lines only to beshot down by his opponents on both sides of the divide. As Reform seeks to consolidate its opinion poll lead we can expect little more to be said about it.\n\nAt last, however, a mainstream politician has stuck his head above the parapet, albeit only now that he has left parliament when it is too late for him to do anything about it. Sir Sajid Javid, a former Health Secretary, has written the foreword to a new report from the Policy Exchange think-tank accepting the argument thatwe cannot carry on this way.\n\nOf course, he makes the now-ritualistic genuflection before the great god. “The NHS is one of our country’s most treasured and beloved national institutions – and for good reason. It speaks to the ideals at the heart of our national life – the principle of equality – that every British citizen deserves the same access to high quality healthcare – and the belief that we all have a responsibility for the health of our neighbours.”\n\nHowever, Sir Sajid adds: “While the strength of our belief in these ideals has not wavered, our ability to deliver them is increasingly being called into question.”\n\nEven this is an excessively charitable observation. I would maintain that cleaving to a set of principles dating to 1948 as the basis for a modern health service having to cope with an ageing population and the soaring costs of routine treatments is lunacy. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity.\n\nAs Sir Sajid points out, the NHS now spends more every month than it did in an entire year when it was set up.Our health budget is the size of the GDP of Portugal– and it will only grow further.\n\nHe calls for “a serious conversation with taxpayers about how we continue funding their favourite national institution”. But no-one in politics wants to have such a conversation. Whenever it is suggested that social insurance might be the way forward they run a mile, even though countries with such systems have far better health care than is provided by the NHS. It is more important to remain with the herd than risk being picked off by the hyenas ready to pounce on anyone unwise enough to stray.\n\nWhen he was Health Secretary, Sir Sajid was required to cite the socialised creed, almost literally. In a speech in 2022 to the Royal College of Physicians, he said: “I believe in the NHS and I believe in its founding principles.”\n\nNow, he acknowledges that the very best performing health systems work because they combine state subsidy, mandatory insurance, co-payments and individual choice. The Policy Exchange authors look at a number of alternatives around the world and say the Dutch is the best. It delivers extremely good coverage and affordable care, but also allows individuals to take more responsibility where they can.\n\nSir Sajid raises the usual Aunt Sally about the grisly aspects of the American system which no-one wants to emulate. The problem is that to get from where we are now to Dutch-style health care will require a cultural and organisational upheaval that no party will contemplate.\n\nIndeed, how the Dutch got to where they are is a salutary lesson. Until the end of the last century the Netherlands had an insurance-based healthcare model, albeit with a tightly regulated, largely “statist” structure. Prices for treatments and procedures were set by the government, as was remuneration and compensation for doctors and hospitals, much as in the NHS today.\n\nIn 1986, following an economic crisis, an inquiry into the structure and financing of healthcare advocated moving to a system of managed competition and greater consumer choice to promote innovation and greater efficiency.\n\nThe report of the Dekker Commission was entitled “Willingness to Change”, an absolute requirement which this country seems congenitally incapable of embracing despite Labour’s election winning mantra last year.\n\nIt then took the Dutch years to “have the conversation”, devise the changes, push them through the legislative processes in the teeth of opposition from various vested interests, including doctors.\n\nWorsening waiting list times and rising costs provided the political impetus to reform in 2006 whereas here they are simply an excuse to pour more money into an unreformed system.\n\nThe PolEx report describes the emergence of a healthcare funding model in the Netherlands based on private insurance and offering a basic healthcare package, giving fairly comprehensive service coverage, while a competitive market exists for healthcare providers.\n\nDutch spending on health is lower than here and yet the outcomes are better with lower avoidable mortality rates. Its approach might not transfer seamlessly to this country; but adopting a mix of the best systems in Europe must surely be an improvement on the gradual collapse of health care in Britain.\n\nSir Sajid says emphatically: “What we cannot afford to do is to bury our heads in the sand.” Yet that is exactly what we are doing.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"William Kolbe column: What is so un-American about DEI?",
    "News_text":"Diversity, equity and inclusion programs have come under attack in American boardrooms, state legislatures and college campuses — and now broadly across the federal government,” Nicquel Terry Ellis said for CNN.\n\nThe Republican White House ordered employees of federal DEI and accessibility offices to be put on paid administrative leave. and DEI is in the crosshairs of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency; last year Elon Musk called DEI “just another word for racism, because it discriminates on the basis of race, gender and many other factors. It is not merely immoral; it is also illegal.”\n\nWealthy corporate leaders have decried diversity programs on social media. Some U.S. companies, including the nation’s largest employer, Walmart, have backpedaled on some DEI initiatives, including racial equity training programs for staff and evaluations designed to boost supplier diversity.\n\nSo, what is so un-American about DEI?\n\nCritics say DEI programs are discriminatory and attempt to solve racial discrimination by disadvantaging other groups, particularly White Americans.\n\n“DEI has become a social and political lightning rod for lawmakers, corporate leaders and conservative activists who have sought to cast such initiatives as unfair and even racist, with some emboldened by the Supreme Court’s gutting of affirmative action,” Ellis wrote.\n\nPresident Trump has made it clear how he feels about DEI practices, not just by taking so many anti-DEI actions so quickly, but also by excoriating DEI as “dangerous, demeaning, immoral, and illegal.” In its place, he wants to “restore merit-based opportunity.”\n\nThe ideology behind DEI is “fundamentally anti-American,” said Ryan P. Williams, president of The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\n“The words that the acronym ‘DEI’ represent sound nice, but it is nothing more than affirmative action and racial preferences by a different name, a system that features racial headcounts and arbitrarily assigned roles of ‘oppressor’ and ‘oppressed’ groups in America,” Williams said in an emailed statement.\n\n“If we continue to do democracy this way, it will only end in acrimony, strife, resentment, and American collapse,” he continued.\n\nMembers of the Heritage Foundation called Biden’s Equity Plans “part of the unprecedented push for color-conscious policies that entrenched racial discrimination in the federal government, its contractors, and its grantees.”\n\nHowever, their critique of DEI is not without its share of what can easily be seen as conspiracy theory — “operatives from the main organization of Black Lives Matter, founded by Marxists to fundamentally transform America, had helped the Biden Administration draft the equity action plans.”\n\nIn their document titled: “How the Nukes Were Queered: A Case Study in DEI as a Political and Bureaucratic Weapon,” they write, “DEI presents a significant danger to national security, risking deterrence and raising questions about insider threats and the role of foreign influence.”\n\nOn the other hand, why might America need DEI?\n\nMark Cuban, billionaire and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, defends DEI.\n\n“Good businesses look where others don’t, to find the employees that will put your business in the best possible position to succeed,” Cuban posted on X. “You may not agree, but I take it as a given that there are people of various races, ethnicities, orientation, etc. that are regularly excluded from hiring consideration.”\n\nHe added, “By extending our hiring search to include them, we can find people that are more qualified. The loss of DEI-Phobic companies is my gain. Having a workforce that is diverse and representative of your stakeholders is good for business.”\n\nFormer Merck CEO Ken Frazier said, “At its best, DEI is about developing talent, measuring it in a fair way and finding hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has an equal chance to exhibit their abilities.”\n\nDEI programs in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasizing diversity as a commercial benefit.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programs appear to be trending downward, “nearly all” Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites.\n\nDEI is not just about checking a diversity box: It’s about fostering an environment where innovation, inclusion, and equity drive growth and success.\n\nA diverse workforce leads to better decision-making and innovation. According to a McKinsey & Company report, companies with more diverse teams are 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry average.\n\n“Historically, marginalized communities — particularly women and people of color — have faced barriers to career advancement. DEI programs aim to address these disparities by offering mentorship, leadership training, and fair hiring practices,” wrote Felicia Shanken in Philadelphia Women’s Network Connection.\n\nDEI initiatives make companies more attractive to employees. Research shows that inclusive workplaces experience lower turnover rates and higher employee engagement.\n\nBy 2045, America is projected to be a majority-minority country. Businesses and organizations that embrace DEI will be better positioned to serve a diverse consumer base and build long-term relationships with customers.\n\nDEI remains one of the most important strategies for creating a fairer and more just society. DEI doesn’t mean giving preferential treatment — it means removing barriers so everyone competes on a level playing field.\n\nDEI isn’t about taking opportunities away from one group to give to another. It’s about expanding opportunities for everyone. An inclusive workplace values all employees, fosters collaboration, and drives innovation.\n\nTo me, DEI shares a lot in common with our nation’s motto — “E Pluribus Unum” — “Out of Many, One.” It establishes diversity as a core American value that captures the essence of a nation formed from diverse people, cultures and perspectives.\n\n“DEI is embedded in the DNA of the United States, divinely inspired to be inked onto the pages of its founding documents,” wrote Anslem Paul in Message Magazine. “E Pluribus Unum” affirms that diversity strengthens the nation.”\n\n“The Declaration of Independence demands equity to ensure that all people have a fair chance to exercise their unalienable rights,” continued Anslem.\n\n“The Constitution lays the foundation for an ever-expanding vision of inclusion, ensuring that the ‘We the People’ of today is broader and more just than it was in 1787.”\n\nDEI puts us on a path to find the common threads that bind us, to forge unifying, cohesive, collective, and shared national experiences to bring the country together again.\n\nI’d say that’s good for America, wouldn’t you?",

    "News_title":"Opinion - How China — and even US taxpayers — are funding the left’s climate lawfare campaign",
    "News_text":"Congressional hearings come and go, but some are supremely useful in terms of casting light on egregious efforts at ideological circumvention or subversion of democratic processes.\n\nOne such importanthearingoccurred last month in the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights, titled “Enter the Dragon — China and the Left’s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance.”\n\nIn the words of the subcommittee chairman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the problem is “a systematic campaign against American energy,” driven by a “coordinated assault by the radical left backed and paid for by the Chinese Communist Party, to seize control of our courts, to weaponize litigation against U.S. energy producers, all in order to undermine American energy dominance.”\n\nCruz explained that foreign money from entities tied to Chinese Communist Party fund efforts by climate advocacy groups to litigate against American energy producers. This litigation is pursued by “activist lawyers” filing lawsuits designed to bankrupt energy producers and to dismantle energy infrastructure “through sheer attrition.”\n\nCruz argued as well that the judiciary is being quietly captured and brainwashed as “left-wing nonprofits host closed-door training that indoctrinates judges to adopt the ideological goals of the climate lawfare machine.”\n\nCruz’ narrower argument about judiciary being captured has a few holes, in that the climate lawfare campaign is in aslow-motion collapse. Such litigation has been rejected in courtrooms virtually without exception — in a Bucks County, Pa. Court of Common Pleasdecision, adecisionby the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, adismissalby New Jersey Superior Court Judge Douglas Hurd, adismissalby Anne Arundel County Circuit Court Judge Steven Platt, adismissalby Judge Videtta Brown of the Baltimore City Circuit Court, adismissalby Delaware Superior Court Judge Mary M. Johnston, thedismissalof the San Francisco and Oakland case, and in aunanimous dismissal by the U.S. Supreme Courtin American Electric Power vs. Connecticut.\n\nBut the nearly universal failure of the climate lawfare campaign in court is not for want of trying, and this poses problems all of its own. Consider theClimate Judiciary Projectof theEnvironmental Law Institute. No objective reading of its legal theories and propositions could fail to conclude that their efforts represent a blatant ideological campaign of litigation against fossil energy producers. Theirclimate science arguments— presented as settled science to judges — are uniformly alarmist,ignoring the evidenceon climate phenomena, the failure of the climate models to predict the temperature record, the impossibility of the assumedgreenhouse gas scenario, the distinction between natural and anthropogenic influences on climate phenomena, and much more.\n\nBut in the view of the Climate Judiciary Project, it cannot hurt to keep trying — in particular given that itsfundingstreamfrom various foundations is substantial. Who knows? at some point some judge might rule in its favor, and then who knows what the appellate courts might do?\n\nCruz’s larger argument about the perverse nature of the lawfare waged against U.S. energy producers is correct and crucial. His “sheer attrition” point is illustrated well by the longstanding leftist effort to block the construction of new pipelines and other energy infrastructure, in substantial part by suing on grounds based in the National Environmental Policy Act. NEPA, as applied by the courts, has been deeplyperversefor decades, although a recentdecisionby the Supreme Court narrowed it somewhat.\n\nCruz’s warnings about the lawfare campaign against U.S. energy producers and its connections to the Chinese Communist Party remain highly relevant, as detailed in the hearingtestimony by Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center.\n\n“America’s enemies, especially Russia and China, are pleased when we hobble our energy sector,” Walter said. “They want to be in a stronger economic position, whether selling Russia’s natural gas in Europe or selling China’s “green” technology in America. This fact shouldn’t be controversial.”\n\nWalter continued: “Many environmentalist groups funded by the multitude of left-wing billionaires have disturbing foreign ties. For example, the Rocky Mountain Institute, best known for its notorious study attacking gas stoves, now has a China program set up by its current CEO.”\n\n“The California China Climate Institute is another troubling environmentalist group,” he said. “Housed at UC Berkeley, [it] partners with the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at China’s Tsinghua University, the alma mater of Xi Jinping.”\n\nNor is it only the Chinese, whether directly or indirectly, that fund the energy lawfare campaign. American taxpayers are doing so as well. In earliertestimonybefore the House Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency, Walter had noted that the Environmental Law Institute hasreceived awardsfrom the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThis public funding is utterly perverse, both directly and because taxpayer dollars ought not be used to bias the ongoing development ofclimate science. In the larger context, it represents an attack on our democratic institutions, as a political movement attempts to attain through litigation what it cannot achieve in Congress.\n\nEven more fundamentally, it represents an assault on the Constitution, which is a framework to protect unpopular individuals, groups, and businesses from the whims and passions of ideological attacks. The climate litigation game thus represents a real pollution, so to speak, of our constitutional principles.\n\nBenjamin Zycheris a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Two grandparents have been found guilty of the murder of their two-year-old grandson while his mother was upstairs.\n\nEthan Ives-Griffiths was dangerously dehydrated and severely underweight, with 40 visible bruises or marks, when he collapsed with a catastrophic head injury at his grandparents’ home in Flintshire, NorthWales, on Aug 14 2021.\n\nA jury at Mold Crown Court convicted Michael Ives, 47, and Kerry Ives, 46, of his murder and of cruelty to a child under 16.\n\nShannon Ives, Ethan’s mother, 28, who had been staying with her son at her parents’ home in Garden City when the court heard he was “targeted for abuse and subjected to casual cruelty”, was found guilty of causing or allowing his death and ofchild cruelty.\n\nA jury heard that Ethan’s fatal head injury was caused by deliberate force or shaking and occurred at the time, or in the minutes before, he collapsed.\n\nMichael and Kerry Ives, originally from Wolverhampton, were in the living room with Ethan at the time of his collapse while his mother was on the phone upstairs.\n\nBoth told the jury “nothing” had happened to the toddler before he fainted as they watched television.\n\nKerry Ives said she immediately called Ethan’s mother to come downstairs, but the court heard it was 18 minutes before she called emergency services.\n\nEthan was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital and later transferred toAlder Hey Children’s Hospitalin Liverpool, where he died two days later.\n\nThe court heard Ethan had been placed on the child protection register, requiring him to be seen every 10 days, but when Shannon Ives last saw her social worker, on August 5, she spoke to him on the doorstep and told him Ethan was having a nap.\n\nNo one answered the door when Michael Cornish, a social worker, went to visit in the days before Ethan’s death and a scheduled appointment with a health visitor on August 13 was cancelled.\n\nShannon Ives had fled domestic violence from her home in Mold in June that year, the jury was told.\n\nHer parents accused her of hitting her son, with Michael Ives telling the jury his daughter was “quick-tempered” and would slap Ethan a couple of times a day.\n\nBut Shannon Ives told the court her parents were “horrible” andabusedher as a child.\n\nJurors were visibly upset at points during the five-and-a-half week trial, particularly when CCTV footage from August 4, taken from the back garden of the family’s four-bedroom home, showed Ethan appearing unsteady on the trampoline, or lying down, while other children bounced. The video appeared to show Michael Ives point the garden hose at him, place the toddler’s hands on his head and gesture to another child to punch Ethan.\n\nAfter watching the recording in court, Michael Ives said he felt “ashamed” and admitted being cruel and neglectful of the toddler, but denied mistreating him in other ways.\n\nThe cameras did not show Ethan leave the house after August 4 until August 12, when Michael Ives was seen again carrying him by the upper arm, putting him into a car seat and appearing to punch towards the youngster.\n\nCaroline Rees KC, prosecuting, described the act “as though Ethan was just a bag of rubbish to be slung out”.\n\nWhen Ethan was examined by doctors after his death, he was found to have abdominal injuries likely to have been caused by blows in the days before his collapse.\n\nOther injuries included bruises which were consistent with grip marks on his leg and face.\n\nExperts said Ethan would have died of dehydration within days had he not suffered the head injury. At the time of his death, he weighed just 10kg, the court was told.\n\nThe jury deliberated for six hours and 54 minutes before returning their verdicts on Tuesday morning.\n\nMr Justice Griffiths told them that because of the “unusually distressing” subject matter in the trial, they could be exempted from jury service for the rest of their lives if they wished.\n\nHe said Michael Ives and Kerry Ives would be given life sentences and Shannon Ives faced a “substantial prison sentence”.\n\nThe defendants will be sentenced on October 3.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Genocide’s legal limitations: what the Srebrenica massacre can teach us about Gaza",
    "News_text":"This July marks the thirtieth anniversary of theSrebrenica massacre, which took place in a mountainous enclave in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, near the Serbian border.\n\nBetween July 6 and 11, 1995, over 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and children where killed by Bosnian Serbs in what the UN had declared a “safe area” under direct protection from blue-helmet peacekeepers. The scenes broadcast by war journalists sent shockwaves through the world, and marked a turning point for the West’s collective consciousness.\n\nToday, as images fromGazare-ignite the debate on what constitutes genocide, it is imperative that we look back at Srebrenica to understand how international courts interpret this crime.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)recognised the Srebrenica massacre as genocide. This was a significant legal step, but it also left a bitter taste for many of the victims. This was because the tribunal only deemed the crimes committed in Srebrenica to be genocide,despite other episodesof equally systematic violence against the Bosniak Muslim population in other areas.\n\nThis was the result of an extremely restrictive legal interpretation of the crime of genocide. According to the 1948Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, it requires proof that the acts (such as murder, torture, destruction of living conditions) were committed with the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”.\n\nThe problem lies in how this “intent” is interpreted. Current jurisprudence has broadly adopted what is known as a “purpose-based” approach – a requirement of conscious and deliberate intent to destroy. Under this logic, it is not enough to prove that the acts had devastating effects on a group – they must also be committed with the specific intention of eliminating it.\n\nLeer más:Why have so few atrocities ever been recognised as genocide?\n\nIn modern contexts of conflict, the intention to destroy a group is confirmed through the accumulation of public policies, military decisions, normative frameworks and rhetoric. Incriminating evidence – whether it takes the form of an explicit order, speeches that openly speak of annihilation, or references to a single act of extermination – is almost impossible to objectively record.\n\nMoreover, limiting genocide to one concentrated, media-visible episode means many other more complex and subtle forms of collective destruction can be overlooked.\n\nIn this sense, it is increasingly necessary that we rethink the way we identify genocide. This means moving away from the totalising model of the Holocaust (which is, for some, the only possible form of genocide, and therefore an unrepeatable event).\n\nAn alternative to this traditional approach is what critical legal scholars have called the “knowledge-based interpretation”. This perspective does not require proof of an explicit will to exterminate. Instead, it asks whether the perpetrators knew – or could not have been unaware – that their acts contributed to a systematic pattern of collective destruction.\n\nThis approach is based on a more structural and less individualistic view of genocide. The crime is not committed by one internal subjective will, but through broader patterns made up ofcontextual elements: public policies, legal frameworks of exception, dehumanising rhetoric, and strategic decisions sustained over time. Under this logic, criminal responsibility is not diluted, but adapted to contemporary realities of collective violence.\n\nLeer más:How the world’s first open-source digital map of mass graves could help bring justice to victims in Ukraine and other war zones\n\nThis debate transcends mere questions of theoretical framework. Since October 2023, Gaza has been subjected to a campaign ofprogressive destruction: massive bombardment, cutting off essential services, forced displacement, engineered famine and health system collapse.\n\nMore than 55,000 people have been killedand hundreds of thousands injured, but beyond the numbers, what we are seeing is a sustained annihilation of the Palestinian way of life.\n\nLeer más:Destruction of Gaza heritage sites aims to erase – and replace – Palestine's history\n\nThis was raised by South Africa in the application it brought before theInternational Court of Justice in December 2023. The case was ratified by the Court in itsindication of provisional measures.\n\nWhat this means is that the UN’s highest judicial body has found a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm to the right of the Palestinian people in Gaza to be protected from genocidal acts and other conduct prohibited by the Convention. And yet, the legal recognition of this situation as genocide remains a topic of heated debate.\n\nRaphael Lemkin, the legal theorist who coined the term “genocide” in 1944, understood this crime not only as the physical destruction of people, but also as the elimination of the collective life of a group, its culture, its symbols and its conditions of existence.\n\nThe current legal definition of genocide, shaped by colonial interests and centred on the Holocaust model, deliberately excludes cultural genocide. This narrow view ignores the fact that human groups can also be destroyed through policies of displacement and forced assimilation, strategies that erase memory, language, or ties to a territory. Human groups are not destroyed by direct violence alone.\n\nThirty years after Srebrenica, we urgently need a critical re-imagining of the concept of genocide, not to hollow it out but to restore its protective capacity in the face of new forms of collective destruction. The perpetrator’s knowledge of the impact of their acts should be enough to generate genocidal responsibility – especially if those acts contribute to a systematic plan to eliminate a people.\n\nIn a world where extermination can be administered bureaucratically, international justice must learn to recognise and name the violence of the present – even when it does not fit the categories established in the past. Failure to do so risks impunity for those enacting collective destruction today.\n\nEste artículo fue publicado originalmente enThe Conversation, un sitio de noticias sin fines de lucro dedicado a compartir ideas de expertos académicos.\n\nLee mas:\n\nEurope’s worst mass murder since World War II happened at Srebrenica.
