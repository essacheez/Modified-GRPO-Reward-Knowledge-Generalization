    "News_text":"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (QUEEN CITY NEWS) — A motorcycle crash victim is asking county leaders for change after he waited more than 30 minutes for medical personnel to respond.\n\nHe wants to make sure no one else has to wait longer than he had to.\n\n“The fire department showed up in about 5 minutes — less than 5 minutes, I believe. And then we waited, and the fire department said ‘Hey, where’s the ambulance? We need them emergency traffic‘ and they’re like ‘oh, yeah, we’re still 10 minutes away.‘ I’ve been on the ground for 10 minutes already,” Ullman recalled.\n\nMORE |As Charlotte grows, so do 911 calls – and the burden on firefighters\n\nHe’s recovering from a broken arm from a June motorcycle crash. Bystanders called 911, but he waited more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.\n\n“All I wanted was to get to the hospital so they could start treating me,” Ullman said.\n\nHe spoke before Mecklenburg County Commissioners on Tuesday about emergency response times, hoping they could find a resolution.\n\n“Every minute matters when you’re lying on the pavement, scared, broken in pain, unsure, time moves different. Each minute feels like an eternity. The fire department sat with me for 15 of those minutes, helpless because there was nothing they could do in their scope of practice,” Ullman said.\n\nThe area firefighters’ association wants leaders to address the long-standing issue of emergency response times with Medic. Chiefs say firefighters are spending too long on scenes waiting for Medic crews to arrive, keeping them from other emergencies.\n\n“We continue to hear the discussion referencing 300 fire trucks within the county. The reality, those 300 trucks, only about 100 are staffed full-time time ready to roll at a moment’s notice. Citing the large number inflates expectations while ignoring operational facts. We need you to focus on the reality of our emergency response resources,” said Charlotte Firefighters Association President Mark Finis.\n\nMecklenburg County fire chiefs met with commissioners and Medic officials on June 26 to discuss the growing population and the best ways to decrease response times.\n\n“The goals as they are written today for Medic, in our contract, don’t work anymore. The way that we have built this system and built Medic to be accountable for response times makes it show that we are 98% compliant, when in reality. It’s 60 something,” said Medic executive director John Peterson.\n\nUllman hopes the conversation leads to change.\n\n“All the taxpayers deserve better. Every resident. No one should have to wait 20 minutes for an ambulance,” Ullman said.\n\nHuntersville Fire officials sent Medic a memorandum of understanding and are hoping for a response soon.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

While police officials have not released what causedthat crash on Sunday, people living on Valley Street say speeding has been the primary cause of numerous incidents in the past.\n\nWhile the speed limit is 35 miles per hour, the 2 NEWS team saw several cars going faster than the posted limit in just a single evening. For a narrow two lane road with lots of people nearby, this can have dangerous consequences.\n\nOn Sunday, acar crashedinto a parked vehicle and a home, with the family inside narrowly avoiding injury.\n\nAlong other parts of Valley Street, the same scene has played out many times over the years. Many neighbors can recall several instances during their time on Valley Street.\n\n“We heard a loud crash followed by a bang and looked out the window. A car had hit the telephone pole and flipped end over end, and ended up in our front yard,” said Jeremy Doyle, local resident.\n\nAnother crash happened just months after, getting even closer to disaster.\n\n“My girlfriend was working at the front of the house, a car came speeding through our yard and hit the front of the house,” said Doyle. “Scared the daylights out of her.”\n\nDoyle says he’s reached out to Dayton officials looking for solutions, but has yet to hear anything back.\n\nFurther up the street, an auto scrapyard caught a crash on their security cameras, as a driver crashed into a customer’s vehicle and narrowly missed hitting two people standing outside.\n\n“It’s pretty much a daily, either there’s an accident or there’s something, you know, very close calls all the time, almost every day,” said Emron Obbasov, nephew of owner, T&S Towing and Auto Recycling.\n\nThe owner says there’s a bend in the road at the corner of Valley and Valleycrest that is the setting of weekly accidents from speeding cars.\n\nObbasov believes there must be a solution to keep the crashes from happening.\n\n“At least one speed bump or something, or like a speed trap, like a speed camera. Because it’s getting ridiculous,” said Obbasov.\n\nOne resident walks Valley Street everyday, and with there being no sidewalks along a good chunk of the road, he’s merely an arm’s length away from cars speeding past.\n\n“Just put in a stoplight or some speed bumps at least,” said William Bussell, local resident. “Just slow down, man, I mean, they’re in a hurry to get nowhere fast.”\n\n2 NEWS has reached out to Dayton’s civil engineering office on any upcoming projects to help slow down drivers.

    "News_text":"Liverpooland Portugal forwardDiogo Jotahas died aged 28 after his car crashed off the side of a motorway and erupted in flames.\n\nJota was in the car with his 26-year-old brother, Andre, a footballer for FC Penafiel inPortugal, who also died. No other vehicles wereinvolved in the crashshortly after midnight local time, Spanish authorities said.\n\nThe car left the road after a tyre blew out during the overtaking of another vehicle, the Spanish Civil Guard toldThe Independent. A charred patch of grass divides the two carriageways of the northwestern A-52 motorway, where the crumpled body of the Lamborghini lay before it was removed on Thursday.\n\nLiverpool FC said they were “devastated” by Jota’s death and requested privacy for the family as they come to terms with an “unimaginable loss”. The Portuguese star scored 65 goals during five years at the club, in which he played a major role in a host of trophy wins.\n\nJotamarried long-term partner Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children, in Porto less than two weeks ago. “A day we will never forget,” reads the caption of his last Instagram post, which shows a video of the wedding day.\n\nTributes poured in throughout Thursdayfrom players, clubs, sporting figures and football fans, who just months earlier witnessed Jota win his first Premier League title.\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot said the “sense of shock is absolute” for the club.\n\n“Diogo was not just our player,” he said. “He was a loved one to all of us.\n\n“I could say so much about what he brought to our team but the truth is everyone who watched Diogo play could see it. Hard work, desire, commitment, great quality, goals.\n\n“The essence of what a Liverpool player should be.”\n\nSlot said the player “never sought popularity” but gained it anyway and was a friend to everyone, able to make others feel good about themselves “just by being with them”.\n\nHe said the last time they spoke he wished Jota luck for his upcoming wedding.\n\n“In many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this,” Slot added.\n\nThe Portugal international joined Liverpool from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 and established himself as a key attacker under Jurgen Klopp and latterly Arne Slot, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup in his five-year spell at Anfield.\n\nWolves said Jota was “adored by our fans, loved by his teammates and cherished by everyone who worked with him”. They added: “The memories he created will never be forgotten.”\n\nThe Portugal national side said Jota was “not only a fantastic player with almost 50 caps ... but also an extraordinary person who was respected by all his teammates and opponents”.\n\nJurgen Klopp, who signed Jota from Wolves and was his manager at Liverpool until 2024, said he was “heartbroken” by the news.\n\n“This is a moment where I struggle!” he posted on Instagram. “There must be a bigger purpose! But I can’t see it! I’m heartbroken to hear about the passing of Diogo and his brother André.\n\n“Diogo was a not only a fantastic player, but also a great friend, a loving and caring husband and father! We will miss you so much! All my prayers, thoughts and power to Rute, the kids ... and everyone who loved them! Rest in peace.”\n\nNational teammate Cristiano Ronaldo paid tribute on Instagram. “Doesn’t make any sense,” he wrote. “Just now we were together in the national team, just now you were married.\n\n“To your family, to your wife and children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world. I know you will always be with them.”\n\nPortuguese prime minister Luis Montenegro posted on social media: “The news of the death of Diogo Jota, an athlete who greatly honored Portugal’s name, and his brother is unexpected and tragic. I extend my deepest condolences to their family. It is a sad day for football and for national and international sports.”\n\nPorto FC, a major club in Jota’s home city where he played on loan during the 2016-17 season, said it is “in mourning” after the death of Jota and Andre, who was also in the youth ranks.\n\nMany current and former players paid tribute. Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher said: “Devastating news about Diogo Jota & his brother Andre this morning.\n\n“Thoughts are with everyone of their family & friends, especially his wife Rute & their three lovely kids.”\n\nHarvey Elliott, a Liverpool youngster who made his debut shortly before Jota joined, left a heartfelt tribute for his teammate. “I can’t put into words how much this hurts us,” Elliott said.\n\n“You were an incredible footballer... the kind that made a difference every single time you stepped on the field. You were humble, hardworking, kind, and always there for anyone that needed anything.\n\n“I feel so lucky to have shared the pitch with you, shared memories and moments I’ll carry with me forever. You’ll always be part of this team, part of the Liverpool family, We will never, ever forget you.”\n\nDarwin Nunez, another Liverpool teammate, said there are “no words to comfort you for so much pain”. He added: “I will always remember you with your smile, as a good teammate on and off the field.”\n\nJota’s former Wolves teammate and Portugal international Ruben Neves said: “They say that we only lose people when we forget them. I will never forget you.\"\n\nSteven Gerrard, one of Liverpool’s greatest-ever players, said: “RIP Diogo. Condolences to his family and friends during this incredibly sad time.”\n\nPrince William said in a post on X that as “part of the footballing family” he was “deeply saddened” to hear of Jota’s death.\n\nAnd tennis legend Rafael Nadal said it was “sad news” and offered his “thoughts and affection” to Jota’s family.\n\nDarts star Stephen Bunting, a well-known Liverpool fan, posted a picture of him alongside the footballer.\n\nHe wrote: “Such sad news I’m hearing. RIP Diogo Jota. What a lovely person. Such a sad day for the football world and beyond. Only just married too. My heart goes out to the family and we are all sending our prayers.”\n\nThe governing body for European football, Uefa, said it is “deeply saddened” to hear of Jota’s loss, while a host of Premier League clubs offered their condolences.\n\nBorn in Porto in 1996, Jota joined the Pacos de Ferreira youth setup in 2013 before making his senior debut in autumn 2014.\n\nHe first appeared in Portugal’s top division in February 2015, becoming the youngest player at his club to score in the top division. Jota joined Spanish club Atletico Madrid in 2016, before his move to the Premier League one year later.\n\nAfter starring for Wolverhampton Wanderers for three years, he stepped up to a Liverpool team who had just won the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nAlready known for his pace, dribbling and lethal ball-striking ability with both feet, Jota arrived at Anfield in 2020 and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club in all competitions. He also made 49 appearances for Portugal, twice winning the Uefa Nations League.",

One recent study from AAA found that driver inattention, or being engaged in other activity, was involved in58 percent of teen crashes.\n\n“Driving distracted doesn’t just put the driver at risk of injury or death; it puts everyone else on the road in danger of an accident,” Dr. Rebecca Robbins, of the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said in astatement. “The findings from the study give us insights into the perceptions and beliefs from teenage drivers, which can be used to help create effective interventions to prevent distracted driving.”\n\nRobbins is a founding member of Mass General Brigham and the lead author of the research, which was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed journalTraffic Injury Prevention. The study — co-authored by researchers in Germany and at other U.S. universities — was funded by the Casey Feldman Foundation, which is named in honor of a 21-year-old woman who was killed by a distracted driver in 2009.\n\nTo reach these conclusions, the authors analysed data compiled during 20 interviews with high school students and a survey of more than 1,100 teen drivers across the U.S. They were hoping to pinpoint which factors influenced the teens to engage in distracted driving.\n\nThey found that teen drivers spend an average of 21.1 percent of each trip looking at their phone, and 26.5 percent of their glances away from the road lasted for two seconds or longer — a duration which dramatically increases their risk for a crash. Taking your eyes off the road for even five seconds at 55 miles per hour is similar to driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed, according tothe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe most common reason cited for the teen drivers’ distraction was entertainment, followed by texting and navigation.\n\nFurthermore, teen drivers recognized that they understand distraction at the wheel is associated with negative outcomes, but also said they believe that their peers drive distracted.\n\nAcross the country, more than 35 states havebanned all types of phone usage for young drivers. However, in a previous national study, 91.8 percent of adolescents reported “regularly engaging” in at least one distracted driving behavior per trip.\n\n“We found that while young drivers recognize the advantages of using smartphone features like GPS, they also understand the heightened risk of accidents associated with distracted driving,” said Robbins. “Encouraging the use of ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode, keeping phones out of reach and ensuring teens get adequate sleep are effective strategies to mitigate this dangerous behavior.”",

    "News_title":"Explainer-Do international carbon credits fight climate change?",
    "News_text":"By Kate Abnett\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission has proposed an EU climate target for 2040 that allows countries to count carbon credits bought from developing nations towards the EU goal for the first time.\n\nHere's what that means, and why the EU move on Wednesday faced criticism from campaigners and some scientists.\n\nWHAT ARE CARBON CREDITS?\n\nCarbon credits, or offsets, involve funding projects that reduce CO2 emissions abroad in place of cuts to your own greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nExamples include forest restoration in Brazil, or converting a city's petrol buses to electric. The buyer counts \"credits\" for those emission reductions towards its climate goal, and the seller gets finance for their green project.\n\nProponents say the system generates much-needed funding for CO2-cutting efforts in developing nations and lets countries work together to cut emissions around the world.\n\nHowever, the reputation of CO2 credits has been dented by a string of scandals in which credit-generating projects failed to deliver the climate benefits they claimed.\n\nWHY IS THE EU BUYING THEM?\n\nThe European Commission proposed allowing up to 3 percentage points of the EU's 2040 target - to cut net emissions by 90% from 1990 levels - to be covered by carbon credits bought from other countries.\n\nThe EU's existing climate targets require countries to meet the goals entirely by cutting emissions at home.\n\nThe bloc's executive Commission said last year it hoped the EU could agree a 90% emissions-cutting target for 2040, with no mention of carbon credits.\n\nTumultuous geopolitics and the economic woes of European industries have since stoked political pushback, with governments from Germany to Poland demanding a softer target.\n\nIn response, the Commission said it would add flexibilities, and landed on carbon credits as a way to retain a 90% emissions-cutting goal while reducing the domestic steps needed to reach it.\n\nEU countries and the European Parliament must negotiate and approve the goal.\n\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS?\n\nThe EU plan was welcomed by countries including Germany, which had pushed to include carbon credits in the goal, and by carbon credit project developers as a boost for climate finance.\n\nBut environmental campaigners said the EU was shirking domestic CO2-cutting efforts and warned against relying on cheap, low-value credits.\n\nThe EU's climate science advisers had also opposed buying credits under the 2040 target, which they said would divert money from investments in local clean industries.\n\nThe EU banned international credits from its own carbon market after a flood of cheap credits with weak environmental benefits contributed to a carbon price crash.\n\nTo try to address the risks, the Commission said it would buy credits in line with a global market and rules for trading carbon credits which the U.N. is developing. These include quality standards aimed at avoiding the problems that unregulated credit trading has faced in recent years.\n\nBrussels will also propose rules next year on specific quality standards for the carbon credits the EU buys.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL IT COST?\n\nThe EU doesn't yet know. Carbon credit prices today can be as low as a few dollars per tonne of CO2, up to more than $100, depending on the project.\n\nEU emissions records suggest the bloc would need to buy at least 140 million tonnes of CO2 emissions to cover 3% of the 2040 target, roughly equivalent to the Netherlands' total emissions last year.\n\nOne senior Commission official said the bloc was determined not to hoover up cheap junk credits.\n\n\"I don't think that would have any additional value. The credits we see currently on voluntary carbon markets are very, very cheap, and that probably reflects a lack of high environmental integrity,\" the senior official said.\n\n(Reporting by Kate Abnett; additional reporting by Virginia Furness; editing by Philippa Fletcher)",
    "Atomic_Facts":"[\"The European Commission proposed on July 3, 2025, that for the first time, EU countries can count carbon credits purchased from developing nations towards the EU's climate target of cutting net emissions by 90% by 2040.\", \"The European Commission stated that to meet the 2040 target, the EU would need to buy at least 140 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, which is roughly equivalent to the total emissions of the Netherlands in the previous year.\\n```\"]"

Hall, 43, of Collins Street, Westfield, accepted the plea agreement after initially declining to accept an agreement that would have had her serve three months in the Hampden County House of Correction, which was requested by a Hampden County assistant district attorney, according to court documents.\n\nThe family of Aleksandr Vdovichenko of Westfield, the man who died after Hall crashed into his wheelchair in September 2024, requested she not be jailed on the charge, according to court documents.\n\nShe was also placed on probation for two years.\n\nHall was charged and arraigned on a single count of motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation on Dec. 2. She pleaded not guilty and was released on personal recognizance, according to court documents.\n\nThe incident that led to Hall’s plea occurred at about 4:30 p.m., Sept. 8.\n\nShe was driving her Hyundai Kona eastbound on Franklin Street when she told State Police investigators she became distracted just moments before hitting Vdovichenko’s motorized wheelchair.\n\nThere was a witness to the crash.\n\nThe witness told the investigators that she had stopped her vehicle at the end of Kellogg Street to allow Vdovichenko to cross the street’s crosswalk in his wheelchair.\n\nAfter he crossed Kellogg Street, the witness said Vdovichenko immediately turned left onto Franklin Street crosswalk and started across.\n\nHe safely crossed the westbound lane and was in the eastbound lane when struck by Hall’s car.\n\nHe was transported to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield where he succumbed to his injuries. Investigators noted that the crosswalks, across Franklin and Kellogg, had been newly painted.\n\nThe witness also told investigators “that she observed the driver of the suspect vehicle to be traveling at a fast rate of speed (speed limit is 35 mph) for the area,” according to court documents.\n\nDuring the State Police Crash Analysis Reconstruction Section, the operating system of Hall’s vehicle was downloaded and “showed that the Hyundai Kona that Hall was operating was traveling at 42 mph.”\n\nThe report also noted that “there were no obstructions to visibility while traveling east on Franklin St.”\n\nAfter the crash, Hall remained at the scene and admitted to investigators she had been distracted moments before the crash.\n\nVdovichenko was the third pedestrian death in the city since 2021.\n\nOn Sept. 12, 2021, a man was struck by a car at the intersection of Mechanic and Bartlett streets and died the next day of his injuries, according to crash data compiled by the state’s Department of Transportation.\n\nOn May 5, 2023, a woman crossing at the pedestrian crosswalk on Elm Street near the District Courthouse and CVS died after being struck by a vehicle, according to Police Department logs.\n\nRead the original article onMassLive.",

    "News_text":"As Texans prepare for barbecues, fireworks, and road trips to celebrate Independence Day, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) is reminding everyone to prioritize safety, and they’re deploying extra troopers on the roads to help ensure that happens.\n\nFrom July 3 to July 6, DPS will ramp up patrols across the state as part of Operation Crash Awareness Reduction Effort (CARE). The goal? Keep drivers safe and crack down on dangerous behaviors like speeding, drunk driving, and ignoring the state’s Move Over, Slow Downlaw.\n\n“The Fourth of July is a time to celebrate our freedoms with family and friends, but safety must come first,” said Highway Patrol Chief Bryan Rippee in a recentannouncementfrom the DPS. “Whether you’re on the road, on the water or handling fireworks, make smart choices that protect you and those around you. Let’s work together to ensure everyone has a safe and happy Independence Day.”\n\nLast year’s Fourth of July crackdown was no small effort:troopers handed out over 59,000 citations and warnings.\n\nIn total, that included more than 5,000 tickets for speeding, over 1,500 citations for drivers without insurance, and hundreds of additional violations for those not wearing seatbelts. The DPS alsoarrested 212 people for driving while intoxicatedand250 more on various felony charges.\n\nThis year, DPS is urging drivers to plan ahead if they’re drinking, always buckle up, and avoid distractions behind the wheel, aka no texting or fiddling with apps while driving.\n\nAnd don’t forget to slow down and move over for emergency vehicles and tow trucks stopped on the road;it’s not just courteous, it’s the law.\n\nAlong with a focus on enhancing road safety, the department is also reminding Texans tohandle fireworks responsibly.\n\nSome of their precautions include: Lighting them only in open areas away from buildings, always having water handy, and never letting young kids handle fireworks. After your firework show, it is also recommended to soak all used fireworks in water before tossing them out.\n\nFirework injuries tend to run rampant on July 4th.\n\nIn 2024,11 people died in incidents involving fireworks, with most of those tragedieslinkedto improper use or malfunctioning fireworks, per the Consumer Product Safety Commission. That same year, an estimated14,700 individuals sustained injuries from fireworks– a big jump of around 38% in fatalities and 52% in injuries compared to 2023.\n\nSparklers alone accounted for about 1,700 emergency room visits in 2024.",

    "News_text":"A handful of House Republican holdouts flipped on Donald Trump's megabill after an hourslong standoff. How prosecutors' argument in Sean Combs' federal trial fell apart. And a Liverpool soccer star is killed in a car crash.\n\nHere’s what to know today.\n\nLawmakers in the House pulled an all-nighter on the massive domestic policy package for President Donald Trump’s agenda, as a handful of Republican holdouts stalled the procedural “rule” vote for several hours.\n\nFive Republicans had initially joined Democrats in voting “no” on the procedural vote, including members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, as well as the center-right Republican Main Street Caucus and Republican Governance Group.\n\nBut after hours of negotiations, most of the Republican holdouts flipped their votes and the House advanced the bill by a vote of 219-213. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., was the only Republican who voted against the rule.\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign uphereto get it in your inbox.\n\nAsked how he was able to win over the Republican holdouts, Johnson told reporters, “There was just a lot of patience and listening to everyone’s concerns and making sure that their, their concerns were addressed.”\n\nThe Senate-approved version of the “big, beautiful bill” would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military and make significant cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy funding. It would also raise the debt limit by $5 trillion.\n\nFreedom Caucus leaders were unhappy about the Senate bill increasing the deficit and not going far enough on clean energy and Medicaid, and other GOP House members were unhappy with the more aggressive Medicaid cuts in the Senate bill, along with a series of clean energy funding rollbacks.\n\nTrump joined Johnson’s all-day efforts yesterday to sway holdouts by holding meetings and making phone calls. Overnight, the president ramped up his pressure on holdouts in a social media post. “What are Republicans waiting for???” he wrote. “What are you trying to prove???”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nCIA officials failed in some cases to follow standard procedures in an intelligence analysis of Russian interference efforts in the 2016 election, according to a newly declassified internal review, but the reviewdid not refute the officials’ findings.\n\nA Trump-pardoned Jan. 6 defendantwas sentenced to life in prisonfor plotting to murder the FBI special agents who investigated him.\n\nAn app that encourages users to share ICE agent sightings in their area has seen a surge in popularityand backlash from the Trump administration.\n\nA 21-year-old congressional intern in Washington, D.C.was fatally shotwhen gunfire erupted earlier this week, though police said he was not the intended target of the shooters.\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combswas acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking chargesin his federal trial but found guilty on two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. For the hip-hop mogul and his defense team, the jury's verdict was seen as a win. But it was a blow to the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe seven-week trial saw federal prosecutors attempt to paint Combs as someone who used his power, wealth and influence to lead a \"criminal enterprise\" to sexually abuse and exploit women for over two decades. Jurors heard from almost three dozen prosecution witnesses, including graphic testimony from Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura.\n\nCombs' defense team, on the other hand, didn't call a single witness, didn't dispute their client's history of domestic violence, and acknowledged that Combs arranged drug-dazed, marathon sexual encounters called \"freak offs.\" The team's ownership of those allegations might have had a strong influence over the jury's decision, legal experts and former federal prosecutors said.\n\nAfter the verdict was read, Combs fell to his knees in prayer. His family stood in the background, clapping and cheering. Outside the New York City courthouse, Combs' supporters celebrated with baby oil, an apparent reference to the substance that witnesses said was provided for the \"freak offs.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian set a sentencing date of Oct. 3 and denied Combs' team's request that he be released from prison until then. Subramanian cited the attorneys' own words — \"we own the domestic violence\" — in arguing that Combs is a danger to others.\n\nRead moreabout how prosecutors' case against Combs fell apart.\n\nDiogo Jota, the celebrated Portuguese soccer star who recently won the English Premier League with Liverpool Football Club, has been killed in a car crash, authorities said Thursday.\n\nThe club said it was \"devastated by the tragic passing of Diogo Jota,\" and the Portuguese national team paid tribute to \"an extraordinary person, respected by all teammates and opponents, someone with a contagious joy and a reference within his own community.\"\n\nSpain's Guardia Civil confirmed in a statement that the 28-year-old star and his brother, André Silva, also a professional soccer player, died after a car crash in the Zamora region \"due to a tire blowout while overtaking.\"\n\nThe car then caught on fire and both vehicle occupants were killed by the accident, the statement added.Read the full story here.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to report job figures today for the month of June, with economists expecting that 110,000 new payrolls will have been added — down from the 139,000 jobs added in May, the fewest since February and the fourth monthly decline in the past six months. Economists also expect the BLS's June report to show the unemployment rate at 4.3%, the highest since October 2021.\n\nWhile Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has described overall economic conditions as solid, U.S. firms and various other data points paint a more worrisome portrait. For example, private payrolls processor ADP reported a net decline in jobs added amid a hesitancy for companies to replace departing workers, ADP's chief economist said.Read the full story here.\n\nThe Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with The Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with Vietnam, with U.S.-based companies set to pay a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and 40% tariff on goods routed through Vietnam from other countries, and Vietnam agreeing not to charge any tariffs on U.S. goods. The deal comes just a week before the 90-day pause on the president's sweeping tariffs is set to expire.\n\nNearly three months after the temporary pause on Trump's tariffs first kicked in, few trade agreements have been made. Trump said this week that a deal with Japan was unlikely and that a deal with India was close, though his administration has been suggesting that for weeks. Meanwhile, talks with the European Union have dragged on.\n\nWhile Trump and administration officials previously indicated that the July 9 deadline might be pushed back, Trump said Tuesday that he's not planning a deadline extension and that he is informing the countries of their new tariff rates by writing them \"a nice letter.\" Now, U.S. businesses again face the threat of paying hefty levies on goods bought from overseas.Read the full story here.\n\nBryan Kohberger is set to be sentenced later this monthafter he pleaded guiltyto four counts of first-degree murder and burglary in the 2022 stabbings of four University of Idaho students.\n\nIsrael confirmed that itagreed to a ceasefire proposalby Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

Syracuse Police decided not to pursue due to their policy. Sergeant Thomas Blake of the Syracuse police department spoke on the department’s decision.\n\n“A number of things come into play, not only the safety of the public but also the safety of the person operating the vehicle,” Blake said. “We have to be as smart as possible for that.”\n\nDeputies chased the car for about a minute before it crashed at the intersection of Kenmore and West Newell Street, right by McKinley Park.\n\nThe Sheriff’s Office said the stolen car crashed into another car not involved in the pursuit. The impact pushed that car into a utility pole, which toppled over. Three people were inside the vehicle that got hit, including a toddler and a pregnant woman.\n\nThe two adults were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. The two-year-old was also taken to the hospital as a precaution.\n\nAs for the stolen car, we were told the occupants are 15, 16 and 17 years old. After the crash, deputies say they ran from the scene but were quickly caught. That group was also taken to the hospital, but they were not hurt. Each received an appearance ticket and was turned back over to his or her parents or guardians.\n\n“With the ‘Raise the Age’ and the bail reform that went into place a few years ago, most of the time with a stolen vehicle recovery that leads to an arrest, it’s an appearance ticket,” Blake said.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Courtesty Library of Congress\/Getty\n\nA new research trip to a desert island in the South Pacific may reveal what happen to Amelia Earhart in 1937\n\nResearchers will visit Nikumaroro in November to investigate the Taraia Object, a visual anomaly believed to be remnants of Earhart’s plane\n\nSome everyday items found near the site on the uninhabited island include a woman's shoe, a medicine vial and a makeup bottle from the 1930s\n\nSome everyday objects found on a desert island in the Pacific Ocean may help researchers discover what really happened toAmelia Earhart.\n\nThe ground-breaking aviator, who set out to become the first woman to fly around the world in 1937,vanished about a month into her global journey.\n\nOn July 2, 2025, the 88th anniversary of Earhart’s disappearance, the Purdue Research Foundation and Archaeological Legacy Institute (ALI) announced a joint effort to find the pilot’s missing aircraft. The research trip will visit the Pacific island of Nikumaroro in November 2025 to investigate the Taraia Object, a visual anomaly some believe to be remnants of Earhart’s plane.\n\nThrough documentary records, photos, satellite images, physical evidence and personal testimony, researchers developed theNikumaroro hypothesis— the idea that Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, landed on an uninhabited island instead of crashing at sea.\n\nGetty\n\nSome of the evidence found includes everyday objects believed to have belonged to Earhart: a woman’s shoe, a compact case, a medicine vial and a bottle of freckle concealer.“She had freckles,” senior NBC correspondent Tom Costello said during a segment about the mission on TODAY on July 2. “So [there's] a lot of evidence that in fact Amelia Earhart and her navigator crash landed on this remote island.”\n\nAccording to earlier reporting byNBC, the jar found is \"identical in shape\" to a bottle of Dr.‭ ‬C.‭ ‬H Berry's Freckle Ointment, which promised to make freckles fade, sold in the early 20th century.\n\nThe researcher who discovered it told the outlet, \"It's well documented Amelia had freckles and disliked having them.\"\n\nRWBrooks\/Shutterstock\n\nAdditional evidence pointing to Nikumaroro includes three recorded radio transmissions converging near the island.\n\n“What we have here is maybe the greatest opportunity ever to finally close the case,” Richard Pettigrew, ALI’s executive director, said in apress release. “With such a great amount of very strong evidence, we feel we have no choice but to move forward and hopefully return with proof. I look forward to collaborating with Purdue Research Foundation in writing the final chapter in Amelia Earhart’s remarkable life story.”\n\nThe expedition will begin on Nov. 5, departing from Majuro in the Marshall Islands for Nikumaroro, which is about halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Reachers will spend five days on the island inspecting the Taraia Object and will return to port on Nov. 21.\n\nBut some experts are still skeptical. Ric Gillespie, an author who’s written about Earhart’s disappearance, claims the new expedition won’t find anything.\n\n“We’ve looked there, in that spot,” he toldTODAYof his 12 expeditions to the South Pacific. “There’s nothing there.\" Of the object thought to be her plane, he says \"the [satellite] imagery shows a coconut tree, complete with root ball.”\n\nThough, Pettigrew says it isn’t an easy find.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.“People walking over the beach, or being very close to it, they still wouldn’t have seen it,” Pettigrew told TODAY. “It would’ve been covered by sediment and under the water.”\n\nIf the crews are successful in identifying and locating the aircraft, a second expedition will commence in 2026 to excavate what remains.\n\nRead the original article onPeople",

    "News_text":"A Tampa man who authorities say was under the influence of alcohol when he crashed a boat into a construction barge near the Howard Frankland Bridge last July,killing his passenger, has been arrested.\n\nTravis Stewart, 39, was arrested Wednesday, one day short of the first anniversary of the crash in Tampa Bay that threw 43-year-old Jonathan Boucvalt overboard, records show. Stewart is facing charges of boating under the influence manslaughter and leaving the scene of a vessel homicide, among others.\n\nAn arrest affidavit was not immediately available Thursday, but information previously released by authorities about the crash, as well as publicly available search warrants, shed some light on the case investigated by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nThe crash happened about 4:15 a.m. July 2, 2024, when a 20-foot boat with two people on board collided with a barge near the Howard Frankland Bridge. Boucvalt was thrown into the water. Stewart, who was injured in the crash, left the scene in the boat and was later treated at a hospital, according to wildlife officials.\n\nWildlife commission officers responded along with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Tampa Police Department to search for Boucvalt, whose body was found later that day north of the crash scene.\n\nInvestigators went to the barge after construction workers called authorities and said it appeared it had been struck by another vessel, search warrant affidavits state. On the barge, investigators found blood, some of Boucvalt’s personal effects and broken glass consistent with alcohol containers, as well as fiberglass that appeared to be from Stewart’s boat, the records state.\n\nInvestigators determined that the barge’s green and amber lights were working at the time of the crash.\n\n“Due to the size of the barge and the working perimeter lights, a safe and prudent operator would have been able to see and avoid striking the barge,” a search warrant affidavit filed by wildlife commissioner investigators last August states.\n\nStewart told investigators that he was operating the boat at the time of the crash because Boucvalt was not familiar with the waterway, according to the affidavit.\n\n“Moreover, the evidence left at the scene and the physics of the collision indicate that Boucvalt could not have been driving at the time of the crash,” and the nature of Stewart’s injuries also indicated he was at the helm, the affidavit states.\n\nStewart also admitted to being intoxicated at the time of the crash, and medical staff at the hospital where he was treated told an investigator his blood alcohol level was higher than 0.08, the level at which a boater is presumed impaired under Florida law, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators obtained search warrants for Stewart’s medical records and data from the boat’s GPS system.\n\nStewart also faces three counts of violation of navigation rules causing serious bodily injury or death. He was booked into Hillsborough County’s Orient Road Jail on Wednesday and was being held Thursday without bail, records show. He works as a project manager for a medical company, according to booking information.\n\nBoucvalt was a father of three who lived in LaPlace, Louisiana,according to his obituary.\n\n“Jonathan lived a spirited life, leading with love and light,” the obituary says. “In these hard times, he encourages us all to live in such a way. To think of him not with thoughts of sorrow, but with the joy he made us all feel.”\n\nStewart has two previous DUI arrests in Hillsborough County, court records show.\n\nAfter a 2008 DUI arrest, Stewart pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of reckless driving and was sentenced to one year of probation. After another DUI arrest in 2011, he was given a year of probation and his driver‘s license was revoked, records show.\n\nMore details about the cases were not available Thursday.",

    "News_title":"Detroit Police: 7 of the city's youth shot in less than a week",
    "News_text":"Seven of the city's youth were shot in less than a week, a spate of violence Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison blamed on disputes and easy access to weapons.\n\nBettison spoke of the teen victims on Wednesday night, June 2, before his biweekly \"Walk-A-Mile Wednesdays\" in the community. All the shootings have the same theme, he said — they've stemmed from some sort of argument with feelings of disrespect and shame and have resulted in violence. They include a 4-year-old bystanderkilled while playing at a park, and a 15-year-old killed over a pair of shoes.\n\nAnd \"the common denominator is, these teens shouldn't have guns,\" he said. \"When it comes to parental responsibility, check your teens' rooms. Ensure that they don't have access to your firearms. Because when they do, things like this happen.\"\n\nChildren getting shot and killed isn't something the city should normalize, Bettison said. So when it comes to fighting violent crime in Detroit, he made a promise: \"I will not stop, ever.\"\n\nThe stretch of bloodshed began Friday, June 27, when 4-year-old Samir Josiah Grubbs was shot to death before he could make it up the slide's ladder at Skinner Playfield and 18-year-old Dayvion Shelmonson-Bey was killed, too. A 17-year-old was also shot and survived. Bettison also said that two teenagers were arrested in the case, but charges haven't been filed by prosecutors as of Thursday, July 3.\n\nAn argument over shoes on Sunday, June 29 was settled with gunfire at a home on Mark Twain Street, Bettison told the Free Press. A 15-year-old was killed, and his sister, 13, was grazed by a bullet. That same day, a 16-year-old was shot and killed on Margareta Street.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, July 1, a 17-year-old was shot in the head at the Martin Luther King Jr. Homes and was in critical condition.\n\nViolent crime overall is down in Detroit, according to city data. Homicides are down 20% as of July 1, compared with this time last year. Nonfatal shootings are down 30%.\n\nBut the number of youth shot this week is what Bettison and community violence intervention leaders in the cityhave been working to avoidduring the summer months that often bring more violence to the city.\n\nBoth say they have been proactive in their approach — Detroit police deployed its park units and started cracking down against illegal activity like unlawful block parties and street racing starting in the spring, and violence intervention groups have engaged youth in summer programs and inserted themselves in disputes in order to de-escalate and prevent further bloodshed.\n\nThere's not a single issue to point at when dealing with youth gun violence, said Quincy Smith of the violence intervention group Team Pursuit. There are layers, he said, like poverty, family instability, and a lack of abundance of resources. Many times, the motivation for violence is money, he said.\n\n\"If we had the abundance of resources, employment opportunities, access to these types of things, their mindset wouldn't even be on violence, because they would be too preoccupied with things that would be more productive,\" Smith said.\n\nThere's also a culture of violence that many young people have just accepted, he added — \"they call it crash out time.\"\n\nAnd while Smith said there's not one single issue one can point to for the reasons behind gun violence, he did point to the state legislature as part of the solution and urged them to fund public safety, including violence intervention groups, and the social detriments that are the root causes of violence.\n\n\"Our legislatures have to do what's right. They've got to step up to the plate,\" he said. \"In the meantime, we're losing babies.\"\n\nAndrea Sahouri covers criminal justice for the Detroit Free Press.

    "News_text":"A viral video has been bopping around, with scenes like a disaster movie, as beachgoers in Portugal begin to flee the beach when an ominous, tsunami-like cloud begins to crash over the sand. It’s a rare, although natural phenomenon; and naturally, people panicked.\n\nThe video comes from Praia de Buarcos, a beach enclave about 88 clicks north from Supertubos and Peniche, where the World Surf League holds their annual Championship Tour contest. And the event happened over the weekend, turning a sunny beach day into a strange, stormy, and panicked scene in a matter of minutes. See the footage below:\n\n“It was nuts to have experienced this rolling cloud in the north of Portugal,” one witness wrote onX, also supplying another angle of the cloud, which is perhaps even scarier, even more unusual than the one in the video above. “Felt like a tsunami out of a movie! Apparently it was 150km long, stretching from Figueira da Foz all the way up to Vila do Conde, which is close to where I was.”\n\nRelated: Psychic Predicts Devastating Tsunami on July 5th, 2025\n\nSo, what was it?\n\nAccording to the cloud experts (real thing), it was an Arcus Cloud, also known as a “roll cloud.” For more information, here’s theCloud Appreciation Society(also a real thing, and side note, how do we join?):\n\n“They form as the cold air that is dragged down by all the precipitation falling within the storm splays outwards upon reaching the ground. As it spreads around the storm, it burrows beneath the warmer, less-dense air at ground level. This is lifted most forcefully in the direction of the cloud’s movement, forming a ‘gust front’, in which the warmer air’s moisture can condense into water droplets that appear as the shelf of cloud.”\n\nRelated: 60-Foot Rogue Wave Captured in Pacific Ocean (Video)\n\nRare Tidal Wave Cloud Creates Panic in Portugal (Video)first appeared on Surfer on Jul 3, 2025",

    "News_title":"Record-Breaking July 4th: 72 Million Americans Set To Travel",
    "News_text":"If you feel like the roads and airports have been busier lately, you’re not imagining things.\n\n72 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home between June 28 and July 6, a 2.4% jump from last year, and a whopping 7 million more travelers than in 2019.\n\nAlmost 62 million travelers, or 85% of all holiday voyagers, will hit the road by car. That’s the highest number ever recorded for the July 4th travel period.\n\nAAA’s Texas officesuggeststhat road trippers should plan ahead:pack an emergency kit, check those tires, and don’t forget to fill up before heading out.\n\nLast year, AAA came to the rescue nearly 700,000 times during the holiday week for everything from dead batteries to flat tires and, yes, drivers locking themselves out of their cars.\n\nGas prices are friendlierthan many expected, too.\n\nDespite some recent jitters in the oil market driven by conflict in the Middle East and the looming hurricane season, summer gas prices remain the lowest since 2021, under the Trump administration.\n\nFor Texans staying close to home, popular routes include the classic Houston-to-Galveston stretch down I-45, which is expected to see heavy traffic in both directions on weekends.\n\nFrom July 3 to July 6, the Texas Department of Public Safety willintensify patrols statewideas part of Operation CARE (Crash Awareness Reduction Effort). The initiative aims to keep roads safer by targeting risky driving behaviors such as speeding, driving under the influence, and failing to follow the state’s Move Over, Slow Down law.\n\nAs previously reported byThe Dallas Express, officers issued around 5,000 speeding tickets, more than 1,500 citations to uninsured drivers, and hundreds of tickets to people not wearing seatbelts during their July 4th crackdown in 2024. In addition, DPS arrested 212 people for DWI and another 250 on various felony charges last year.\n\nIf your plan involves a TSA line, you’ll have plenty of company.\n\nMore than 5.8 million people are expected to fly over the holiday period, a slight increase over last year’s record. The average domestic round-trip ticket price sits around $810, up 4% from last summer.\n\nTravel expertssuggest booking midweek flights, such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays, for better deals and fewer headaches, according to AAA.\n\nBeyond cars and planes, nearly 4.8 million Americans will travel by bus, train, or cruise. That number is just shy of the pre-pandemic record set in 2019.\n\nWhere are Americans going?\n\nWhen it comes to destinations, it’s amix of classic summer hotspots and bucket-list cities.\n\nDomestically, Orlando, Seattle, and New York top the charts. Alaska cruises are also peaking, and Hawaii’s beaches are calling, according to the report.\n\nInternationally, Canadians will see many American tourists in Vancouver, while Rome, Paris, and London remain the European favorites.\n\nTiming Is Everything\n\nIf you’re driving, when you leave matters as much as where you’re going.\n\nAccording to traffic data firm INRIX, theworst times to be on the road are generally afternoon and early evening hours, especially on July 2 and July 6.\n\nThe best strategy?Hit the road early, before noon, and try to avoid the midday bottlenecks.\n\nAsDXhas previously reported, late-night driving on weekends can be especially deadly in the Lone Star State, regardless of whether it’s a holiday weekend or not.\n\nData based on NHTSA crash records from 2019 to 2023 revealed that the hoursbetween 9 and 10 p.m. are the deadliest on Texas roads. On average, 254 fatal crashes occur during this hour each year, accounting for more than 6% of the state’s total, the highest number among the ten most populous states in America.",

He was taken into custody.\n\nUnderwood was evaluated at an area hospital for non-life threatening injuries he sustained in the crash. The driver of the other vehicle was also evaluated for non-life threatening injuries and was released on the scene. No one else was hurt.\n\nUnderwood will be booked in the Vermilion County Jail on preliminary charges of possession of a stolen vehicle and aggravated fleeing and eluding, as well as multiple traffic violations.\n\nDanville Police reminded that the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty, and the investigation is ongoing.

    "News_title":"The Most Dangerous (and Safest) States to Drive on the 4th of July Revealed",
    "News_text":"Each Fourth of July, Americans pack the roads to enjoy fireworks and barbecues, and that heavy travel contributes to an increase in deadly crashes, according to a new study.\n\nFuture Bail Bondsexamined five years of crash data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to reveal where and when drivers face the greatest risks on Independence Day. Between 2019 and 2023, 2,394 people lost their lives on July 4th alone, underscoring a hidden danger of the holiday.\n\nMontana ranks as the deadliest state to drive in on Independence Day, with afatal crashrate of 15.75 per million residents, more than double the national average of 6.63.\n\nThe most dangerous hour? Between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., when post-fireworks traffic collides with fatigued or impaired driving. State Routes 35 and US-87\/89 are particularly high-risk, with rural stretches and sparse law enforcement, which may potentially add to the danger.\n\nOther states rounding out the top five deadliest include:\n\nMississippi, with a crash rate of 12.57, peaking between 3 and 4 p.m., likely tied to daytime travel and holiday gatherings.\n\nNorth Dakota, at 12.44, with its riskiest hour between 9 and 10 p.m., especially on local roads like Burleigh Avenue West.\n\nWyoming, with 11.86 crashes per million, sees the highest risk during the early evening hours.\n\nSouth Dakota, at 11.81, sees the most deadly crashes between 11 p.m. and midnight, particularly on Interstate 90 East.\n\nWestern states feature heavily among the most dangerous, highlighting a pattern of higher crash risks in rural, lower-density areas.\n\nAcross the nation, late evening consistently emerges as the most dangerous time to drive on July 4th. Between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., many drivers are returning from fireworks shows or heading home from parties, creating a risky mix of fatigue, impaired driving, and congested roads.\n\nLocal roads, not just big highways, see many of these tragedies. From small county roads in Mississippi to main streets in North Dakota, the study shows you don’t have to be on the interstate to face deadly consequences.\n\nThe study also highlighted where you’re least likely to experience a fatal crash on the 4th of July. Hawaii ranked as the safest state, with acrash rateof just 1.38 per million residents, 81% below the national average. Shorter travel distances, lower speed limits, and less road-tripping likely play a role in keeping fatal crashes down.\n\nOther safer states include:\n\nRhode Island, with a rate of 1.78 per million\n\nMassachusetts, at 2.36 per million\n\nWest Virginia, at 3.39 per million\n\nNew Jersey, at 3.53 per million\n\nMany of these states have strong seatbelt laws, a robust police presence, or dense road networks with lower average speeds, which help minimize severe crashes.\n\nWhile Montana tops the list, other states with high fatal crash rates on Independence Day include South Carolina, Kentucky, and Delaware. On the opposite end, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington also appear among the safest.\n\nKey risk factors the study highlighted include:\n\nThe hour of the day, with crashes often spiking after dark\n\nRural roads, which can leave crash victims far from emergency help\n\nAlcohol and speed, consistently cited as major contributors\n\nThe analysis examined fatal crash rates per million residents on July 4th from 2019 to 2023 using NHTSA data. Researchers ranked each state based on its five-year fatal crash rate, and also highlighted the highest-risk hour of the day and the roads most frequently involved in these deadly collisions.\n\nIf you’re planning to celebrate with fireworks and festivities, plan ahead:Avoid driving late at night if possible\n\nDesignate a sober driver\n\nWatch your speed, even on familiar local roads\n\nExpect heavy traffic and stay patient\n\nThe 4th of July should be a day for celebration, not tragedy. Being mindful of where and when you hit the road can help ensure you enjoy the holiday safely.",

He was facing vehicular homicide and vehicular operationcharges in the death of Victoria Harwell, 31, of Minneapolis.\n\nLast August, Llangari Inga was accused of crashing head-on into a car being driven by Harwell, who later died at a hospital. One of Harwell's eight children, a 14-year-old girl, also was in the car but didn't sustain life-threatening injuries in the crash.\n\nPolice reportedly found open beer bottles in Llangari Inga’s car and his blood alcohol content (BAC) was more than twice the legal limit.\n\nBecause of the deportation, Llangari Inga’s criminal case in Hennepin County won’t move forward.\n\nIn a statement provided toBring Me The News, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty says the resulting harm from Llangari Inga’s deportation was entirely “foreseeable and preventable.”\n\n“The federal government’s dangerous, mindless commitment to deporting people who should be held accountable in the communities they harmed is devastating to victims and their loved ones,” Moriarty said in an emailed statement.\n\nLlangari Inga’s case and the events that followed have been viewed as controversial by some, with the Trump administration highlighting it as an example of Twin Cities officials' handling of undocumented immigrants who commit crimes.\n\nLlangari Inga was the subject of a 2016 ICE order for expedited removal from the U.S.  at the time of his arrest last year. ICE claims that the Sheriff's Office failed to honor the detainer and released him a few days after the fatal crash without alerting the agency.\n\nWhen he was formally charged and arrested again this May, Llangari Inga was released days later on bond for a second time, despite the retainer.\n\nLlangari Inga was then arrested by ICE agents. He had been in ICE custody from May 16 until his deportation on June 24.\n\n“ICE has flown him to his home country where he will not be detained, stripping away any possibility of justice for the people traumatized by his actions,” Moriarty said.\n\nThe victim’s father, Victor Hardwell, told theStar Tribunethat he was disappointed in the decision but not surprised, and that he got a “heads up” from the County Attorney’s Office.\n\nA warrant was issued for Llangari Inga's arrest following his deportation, but it's unlikely that he will ever return to court in Hennepin County.\n\nThis story was originally reported byBring Me The Newson Jul 3, 2025, where it first appeared.",

While speaking with Alvis, he allegedly told the officer that he struck the motorcycle while passing through the intersection, believing that he had a green light.\n\nAlvis reportedly said that he pulled over to the shoulder and went back to see the victim. The officer at the scene said that Alvis had the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from his person and breath, according to documents.\n\nA person who witnessed the crash told police that they were waiting at the red light when they saw the Chevrolet truck approaching.

    "News_text":"ECTOR COUNTY, Texas (KMID\/KPEJ)- State representative Brooks Landgraf said change is on the way for a deadly intersection between Odessa and Kermit.\n\n“Two fatal crashes in two days at the same intersection is unacceptable,” Landgraf said in a statement. “The point where SH 302…crosses FM 181 must change, given the nature of the traffic in this part of the oilfield. I’ve been in touch this morning with our excellent TxDOT district engineer, who is very aware of the intersection and its deadly problems.”\n\nEarlier this week,56-year-old Ricky Dale Shaw, of Odessa, was killed when the driver of a semi-truck failed to stop at a stop sign, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a crash report. A day earlier, investigators said56-year-old Christopher Eric Wilke, of Frisco, was killed when another truck driver failed to yield the right of way at the intersection.\n\nLandgraf said the Texas Department of Transportation has plans to reconfigure the intersection of SH 301 and FM 181 to make it safer for all.\n\n“Designing is underway, construction will begin soon, with scheduled completion in 2026,” Landgraf said.\n\nThe intersection at SH 302 and FM 181 in Ector County is currently a two-way stop with eight traffic conflict points. Landgraf said TxDOT’s reconfiguration plan will change it to an “RCUT” intersection, which will make it impossible for sand haulers and other vehicles to run stop signs that cause deadly crashes. RCUT stands a for “Restricted Crossing U-Turn” intersection. The design modifies how drivers turn and cross at a highway from smaller, intersecting roads.\n\n“RCUTs are a quick and effective way to improve safety by significantly reducing traffic conflict points…have been used successfully in recent years in other parts of the state that feature high volumes of heavy commercial traffic,” Landgraf added.\n\nTxDOT will also reconfigure in the same way the intersections of SH 302 at FM 1936 and SH 301 at FM 866.\n\n“Of course, all of these crashes can be prevented by drivers being more careful, paying attention and following the rules of the road. I know that’s all easier said than done, but driver responsibility is the most important aspect of road safety. My heart goes out to the loved ones of the drivers whose lives have been lost this week, and I’m keeping them in my prayers,” said Landgraf.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

    "News_title":"Trump administration takes aim at rainbow crosswalks like at Pulse nightclub site",
    "News_text":"ORLANDO, Fla. — The Trump administration is seeking to wipe rainbows and other “political banners” from streets and crosswalks across the nation, a move that puts at risk the multi-colored crossing near the former Pulse nightclub in Orlando.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy sent a letter to the nation’s governors this week introducing a “safety initiative” seeking consistent markings on roads. On a post on X the same day, he more clearly spelled out his intentions.\n\n“Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks,” he posted. “Political banners have no place on public roads. I’m reminding recipients of @USDOT roadway funding that it’s limited to features advancing safety, and nothing else. It’s that simple.”\n\nA rainbow crosswalk has been emblazoned on Orange Avenue at West Esther Street since 2017. It’s at the southern boundary of Pulse, the nightclub once seen as a safe haven for the LGBTQ community and where 49 were killed and 53 were wounded in a mass shooting on June 12, 2016.\n\nDuffy’s letter itself doesn’t mention rainbows or “political banners” specifically, but states the agency’s desire to partner with state and local governments to “make the entire roadway right-of-way easier to interpret and navigate for all users.” It cites 39,345 traffic fatalities last year as “unacceptable,” though that marks a 3.8% decrease from the year prior.\n\nCity Commissioner Patty Sheehan, Central Florida’s first openly gay elected official, said she wasn’t surprised that the crosswalks and others like it were in danger. But she noted the rainbow crosswalk is part of the design for the memorial to the nightclub shooting, which received state funding in the budget signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this week.\n\n“I think they’re trying to undo anything that celebrates marginalized people, and that’s just terrible,” Sheehan said. “That rainbow crosswalk is also part of the Pulse memorial and the state just gave us $400,000 toward the memorial, so I would hope they wouldn’t do something that would be detrimental to that memorial.”\n\nOn Wednesday, city officials received a separate memo — though dated a day prior to Duffy’s — from the Florida Department of Transportation, noting that surface markings must “serve a functional, safety-related purpose,” and that the department’s design manual “explicitly prohibits the application of pavement or surface art on travel lanes, paved shoulders, intersections, crosswalks or sidewalks.”\n\nThe manual specifically notes that pavement art associated with social, political or ideological messages is banned, and that the state can withhold funding from any agency not in compliance, according to the state’s letter.\n\nBut such markings can stay on the road with permission from the state “if the public agency is able to demonstrate good cause for doing so,” the memo reads.\n\nIn recent years, Orlando transportation officials have painted at least five major downtown crosswalks with artistic murals, which they say waspart of their planto increase visibility of crosswalks and hopefully improve safety for people crossing.\n\nAt the time, theycited research from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which found a 50% dip in crash rates involving pedestrians and a 37% drop in crashes involving pedestrians at intersections that have asphalt art. Drivers also yielded to pedestrians 27% more often at such intersections, the group’s research showed.\n\nWhile those murals depict the Lake Eola fountain, orange slices, Lake Eola’s famous swans and other apolitical art, they seem to run afoul with the state’s directive.\n\nCity officials hadn’t received the federal letter and are reviewing the state’s directives, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe muralswere announced in 2023, which also marked the paving over of a 400-foot Black Lives Matter mural along Rosalind Avenue, painted in the colors of the Pan-African flag.\n\nIt was first painted in June 2020 by city officials and community members after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which spawned nationwide protests against systemic racism and police brutality, including in Orlando. The mural was ultimately covered up as part of repaving the street three years later.\n\nThe new FDOT memo on street surfaces comes after itadopted a policy in Februaryto limit lighting on state-managed bridges to “a default scheme of red, white and blue,” preventing previous designs such as the rainbow colors on Lake Underhill Bridge on State Road 408 in Orlando in the weeks after Pulse in 2016 and on other state bridges in the years afterward.\n\n_____",

    "News_text":"At a memorial in St. Paul for a 14-year-old who loved gaming, there’s a framed graphic of a video game controller and also the words, “Just 5 More Minutes.”\n\nIt’s what most kids playing video games ask their parents, but also what Kevin Reitmeier’s family wishes they had with him.\n\n“I’d give anything for five more minutes with my nephew,” Jameel Marshall said Thursday.\n\nAt a growing memorial forReitmeier, who died in a motorized scooter crashTuesday, his family remembered the teen and also called for more safety at the West Side intersection.\n\nReitmeier was going into his freshman year at St. Paul’s Humboldt High School. “He loved life, was very energetic, loved his family and friends, loved God,” said aunt Reese Marshall.\n\nHe was adventurous and enjoyed being in nature. He had told his mother he wanted to live in the woods when he grew up, said grandmother Angela Tucker.\n\nOn Tuesday at about 8:50 a.m., police Reitmeier was operating a gasoline-powdered scooter. A 13-year-old, who Reitmeier’s family said was a friend of his, was the passenger. The scooter struck the front of a pickup truck at Ohio and George streets, police have said.\n\nPreliminary information indicated the scooter was being operated in the street, ran a stop sign before the crash, and that neither of the teens wore helmets, police have said.\n\nPolice have said the pickup driver did not show signs of impairment and is cooperating with the investigation.\n\nReitmeier, who lived in the area, was pronounced dead at the hospital. His 13-year-old friend was in critical but stable condition as of Wednesday morning, according to police.\n\nThe intersection is controlled by stop signs at all four corners. Grandmother Stacy Schminkey said there’s a problem with people not stopping at the intersection “and this should have been addressed.”\n\n“I’ve seen the comments online and … they’re blaming” Reitmeier, Schminkey said. “… Don’t put the blame on him when you have grown people who are licensed, passed the test, and they’re not stopping. Then, you’ve got a kid and what’s he going to do? Follow the example of what everyone else is doing.”\n\nWhen the family starts to heal, Schminkey said she’s wants to push for traffic lights at the intersection.\n\nThe city has already been intending to resurface George Street this year, according to the Public Works Department. The plan does not call for traffic lights at George and Ohio streets, though pedestrian and crossing improvements are intended for the intersection.\n\n“Bumpouts (or curb extensions) will be added on the south side of the street to improve visibility of people crossing George Street, reduce the crossing distance for people walking, and slow drivers by narrowing the street. There will also be bumpouts into Ohio where possible,” according to aPublic Works website.\n\nHandwritten notes to Reitmeier have been left at his memorial: “I wish this day wasn’t true,” one said. “Hug your dad extra tight for us,” said another note (Reitmeier’s father died in 2018).\n\n14-year-old who died in scooter crash with vehicle ID’d as St. Paul resident\n\nRising summer heat increases risk of child deaths in hot cars\n\nSt. Cloud trooper dies in reported drowning in South Dakota lake\n\nCultlike Zizian group member charged in border agent’s death seeks delay in death penalty decision\n\n14-year-old killed in St. Paul scooter-vehicle crash; 13-year-old critically injured\n\nAt Reitmeier’s memorial, in addition to the gaming references, there are stuffed animals and balloons in his favorite color of green, flowers and plants because he enjoyed gardening with his mother and picking flowers for her, a Bible for his faith, and his favorite soda and chips — root beer and Funyuns.\n\nReitmeier was “fearless,” said uncle Jameel Marshall. “He never let anything stop him from achieving a goal.”\n\nHe loved fireworks — “the kid was a firework himself” — and he enjoyed the Fourth of July, Marshall said.\n\n“Kevin was the light of all our worlds,” his uncle said.",

    "News_text":"DUNCANSVILLE, Pa. (WTAJ)– Police officers from multiple departments in Blair County attended a DUI training Thursday afternoon to brush up on their procedures before the holiday weekend.\n\nThe training was held at the National Guard Readiness Center in Duncansville. There, instructors with the Pennsylvania DUI Association gave a presentation on why it is so critical that officers get impaired drivers off of roads.\n\n“People have too much to drink or people use drugs and drive and the holidays sometimes exacerbate that because there is an extra day off,” Instructor Jim Gregg said.\n\nAG Sunday urges firework safety ahead of July 4th holiday weekend\n\nGregg said that their message is simple, drive sober or get pulled over. For him, it’s an issue that hits close to home.\n\n“I’m a retired trooper, and as a young trooper, I was involved in a pursuit with a drunk driver where I almost lost my life in a very violent crash,” Gregg said. “Ever since then, I’ve had a personal commitment to impaired driving enforcement.”\n\nDuring the presentation, Gregg told officers not to feel bad when issuing a DUI, because it could save the driver or some else’s life. After, officers go through mock traffic stops where they run through how to properly conduct a field sobriety test. Maggie Nunley, the Regional DUI Program Administrator with the PA DUI Association, said that drivers can do their part to make sure that stops go safely as well by simply indicating to officers that they are pulling over.\n\n“That can be done by putting your four ways on, putting your turn signal on because a lot of people have this idea of well, what if I want to stop for the police but I’m looking for a place that I feel comfortable stopping,” Nunley said.\n\n“There’s too many platforms like Uber, having a designated driver and things of that nature,” Gregg said. “But for those people that do drink and drive, you run the risk of running into one of these talented men or women and they will be conducting field sobriety tests in Blair County.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

I remember the last time I looked at my child before he was in the wreck. I remember all of those little moments. I remember seeing her carpool away, and I also remember seeing the cop car that was going to the wreck, driving to it at that time not knowing that that was where he was going.”\n\nJohnson said the community surrounding her parents is hurting. She said even those who didn’t know them well have been hit by the loss.\n\n“The sheriff’s department, they are hurting so bad,” said Johnson. “That was one of their officers.

Detectives worked to locate the woman, but the task proved difficult as she reportedly moved around frequently.\n\nOn July 3, 2025, she was located and arrested in the 1600 block of Anaheim Boulevard in Anaheim.

    "News_title":"There will be no second chance for Labour",
    "News_text":"The ANC were the first to coin the slogan “make the country ungovernable” as they sought to depose the apartheid government in South Africa. An unruly people would weaken the centre, extract concessions and push tensions until they became contradictions. From there, you get the real prospect of regime change.\n\nBritain remains a relatively prosperous and secure nation. But it is becoming palpably less governable by the day. This is not confined to one party or leader. The lifespan of prime ministers and their cabinets are getting shorter. Parliament is sovereign once again, but it does not feel that way. Successive governments have failed to grip the centre and act decisively to overcome Britain’s malaise.This is the task that falls to Labour.\n\nThese are not easy times in which to govern. The Government has little room for manoeuvre. The bond markets are tetchy, gilt yields are higher than they have been for decades, pushing up the cost of borrowing. The failure of the leadership to shave £5 billion off welfare spending only increases the nervousness. Scleroticism has taken hold in seemingly every institution. How have we got here? And how can Labour get us out of it?\n\nFrom the 1990s through to 2016, the political class on both Left and Right was characterised above all by complacency. These were the fat years. Growth was good, largely because of a booming services economy centred on London and the south east in general and the City of London in particular.This growth enabled New Labour’s economics of redistributionthat supported the country’s heartlands. After years of hardship, Blair’s model seemed to finally bring the warring factions of the country back together again.\n\nThe 2008 crash should have shaken the political class out of its complacency, exposing the precarity of our heavily financialised economy and the malaise that lurked beneath the surface of our now fragile economic model. While services had grown, our productive capacity had been denuded. Strategic industries had been closed down, outsourced or sold o&fflig; to foreign investors. Regions once massaged by public sector employment opportunities and welfare found these tools were no longer powerful enough to smooththe cracks left by deindustrialisation.\n\nThe recession marked the juncture at which Britain began to decline relative to the US and most other European nations, yet it prompted little critical reflection. Austerity was the coalition government’s answer – and it was an expensive one. Huge structural weaknesses in our economy were reduced to a matter of simple accounting. Investment dried up and infrastructure could not keep pace with maddeningly high levels of immigration. Growth, productivity and real wages flatlined. Complacency was still the order of the day for a political class who had grown decadent and far-removed from the real conditions of the country.\n\nWhatever else it may have done, the vote to leave the European Union punctured this complacency.Blue Labour had been warning since 2009 that all was not well in the body politic, that lurking beneath the glitzy New Labour veneer social disa&fflig;ection was growing. Blue represented melancholia as much as conservatism. Now all was out in the open: the disconnect between the political class and the country it sought to govern; the towns that had been left behind, their economic purpose in a global economy obscure; and the dysfunction of government, parliament and our public institutions.\n\nThe Conservatives proved incapable of exiting this quagmire. The 2019 government began with an 80-seat majority and ended in ignominy and an announcement of a new fund for chess players. Lacking the will or confidence to take on Treasury orthodoxy, immigration trebled and levelling up was abandoned. The civil service was left unreformed. Growth continued to stagnate as judicial overreach and regulatory constraints made building impossible. A few brief spasms aside, inertia replaced complacency as the defining feature of our political class.\n\nAs little as a year ago, you could still find echoes of complacency in the political and media class when they spoke of Labour’s election win as a victory for the “grown-ups”. But fixing a broken political system, a dysfunctional state and a stagnant economy requires more than a clean suit and tie. It has taken Labour one year to discover what took the Conservatives 14 years: that Britain, its economy and its institutions, are barely functioning.\n\nToo many in Labour defined themselves solely in opposition to the Conservatives and thought a new Government need only focus on “delivery”, with a few technical fixes here and there. Others wanted to reduce the task of governance to a form of altruism for those in need. Their vibes-based politics has no resonance in the country, no acknowledgment of the hard reality of trade-o&fflig;s in a low growth economy, and no solutions for Britain’s malaise. If there is a divide in Labour it is not between Left and Right, New Labour or Blue Labour, but between those who understand the severity of the country’s situation and those who do not.\n\nThe future success of this Government depends on this understanding. It must be an insurgent on behalf of the people, willing to grip the centre and take on its own party and the scleroticism of our institutions as it rebuilds a shattered country, shifting resources to the productive economy, to build, make and grow, driving social and economic development, radically reducing immigration and speaking for the whole country as one people united in a shared national identity and purpose.\n\nThis is the choice facing Labour, the fork in the road in this inauspicious moment – a retreat into the comfort zone of liberal progressivism confined to the prosperous areas of the country, doing things for a client electorate, promising the impossible, or a striving for a radical rebuilding of the national economy, renewing our sovereign democracy andbuilding our national revival on a broad, cross-class coalition. This way lies a second term and a new political settlement. The first year has not gone well, but there will be no second chance for Labour.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The brothers’ parents attended, as well as Jota’s agent, Jorge Mendes. Mourners left flowers and candles next to a tree outside the chapel were visitation was held.\n\nPortuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa also visited to pay his respects.\n\nThe chapel sits next to the Igreja Matriz de Gondomar church where the funeral for the siblings is planned for Saturday.\n\nGondomar resident Ricardo Alves lamented the loss of the local star as he passed by.\n\n“It is a great sadness. Although I did not know him personally he was from here and I knew many of his friends from the region where he lived,\" Alves said. \"It is a great loss, he is a young man, with a lot still to give and he had a somewhat tragic fate.”\n\nJota, 28, and his brother, André Silva, 25, were found dead near Zamora in northwestern Spain after the Lamborghini they were driving crashed on an isolated stretch of highway just after midnight on Thursday and burst into flames.\n\nTheir bodies were repatriated to Portugal after being identified by the family, Spanish government officials said.\n\nJota and his parents both have homes in Gondomar, where he started his playing career as a child. Gondomar is a working-class town next to Porto, where Jota was born.\n\nJota’s death occurred two weeks after he married long-time partner Rute Cardoso while on vacation from a long season where he helped Liverpool win the Premier League. The couple had three children, the youngest born last year.\n\nSpanish police are investigating the cause of the crash, which did not involve another vehicle, they said. They said they believe it could have been caused by a blown tire.\n\nJota's brother Silva played for Portuguese club Penafiel in the lower divisions.\n\nThe loss was felt sharply in his hometown, especially at his first soccer club, where Jota started playing at age 9.\n\n“He never forgot his roots, nor his friends, because he had a group of friends who were with him in the training here in Gondomar and who he even invited from time to time to go and watch Liverpool games in England,\" Gondomar SC director Anselmo Serra told The Associated Press. “They were like a group of friends that he never forgot over the years.”\n\nHeading to England via boat\n\nJota and his brother were driving overnight to catch a boat from Santander, on Spain’s northern coast, to go to England to rejoin Liverpool, when they crashed, according to Portuguese media.\n\nPortuguese sports website Record published a video interview with Miguel Gonçalves, who said he worked as a physical therapist for Jota. Gonçalves told Record that Jota was avoiding flying due to a lung condition that he recently treated.\n\n“I was in his house at night for a last treatment,” Gonçalves said. “He was proud to have recovered from his pulmonary problem. He was happy to be with his brother. They were excited to spend some time together on the trip.”\n\nSpanish police have yet to say which brother was driving.\n\nLiverpool mourns Jota\n\nCondolences poured infrom Portuguese officials and the world of soccer as news of the accident spread.\n\nA moment of silence was held before Portugal played Spain at the Women’s European Championship in Switzerland late Thursday.\n\nFor a second day, Liverpool fans laid flowers and scarves outside Anfield Stadium. Former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson was among those to place a bouquet at the impromptu memorial to Jota.\n\nLiverpool's players are not due back from their summer break until Monday.\n\nMohamed Salah wrote on social media that it will be hard to return to the team without Jota.\n\n“Teammates come and go but not like this. It’s going to be extremely difficult to accept that Diogo won’t be there when we go back,” Salah wrote. “My thoughts are with his wife, his children, and of course his parents who suddenly lost their children. Those close to Diogo and his brother Andre need all the support they can get. They will never be forgotten.”\n\n___\n\nWilson reported from Barcelona, Spain.

Penney was sentenced to life in prison in 2022 for the deadly crash.\n\nFamilies of Victims of Impaired Drivers share unique perspective with law enforcement\n\nTroopers said Penney initially ran from the scene, but was caught shortly after. They also said they could smell alcohol on his breath.\n\n“We can’t get over the grief that we feel because we love Marissa too much,” said Jeff Murrow, Marissa’s dad, during an interview with News 4 Thursday. “The love doesn’t go away, so the grief doesn’t go away.”\n\nMurrow and his wife Kristy, have since created a non-profit that works with families and state legislators to address concerns about impaired drivers on the roads calledVictims of Impaired Drivers(VOID). Marissa’s story has also inspiredtougher laws in Oklahomato deter drunk driving. Murrow told News 4 the holiday season is when that message needs to be amplified the most, with roadways expected to be busy.\n\nMan who advised OK Gov. Stitt deported to Guatemala\n\n“When you make the wrong choice, it could cost you everything,” said Murrow. “It could cost you your life, or it could cost you the life of someone that you love very dearly in your family, if you’re lucky. The best case scenario is it might cost you a job, or it might cost you your car or your reputation.”\n\nMurrow said he knows there are some people who won’t heed his words, who might think they’ve gotten behind the wheel of a car while drinking and didn’t have any problems before. He said it’s the wrong mentality for any driver to have.\n\n“I know there are some who will probably continue to make that mistake, and one day it will catch up to them,” said Murrow. “I just encourage everyone to make a great decision this holiday weekend.”\n\nIt’s the same advice the Oklahoma Highway Patrol [OHP] is hoping drivers will consider, with enforcement over the holiday weekend expected to be busy.\n\n“We hope they make smart, reasonable, responsible decisions,” said Lieutenant Mark Southall, OHP Public Information Officer. “What people don’t see when they read these headlines of a fatality crash is they don’t see the knock that has to happen at the door when a trooper has to go tell someone’s loved one that they’re not coming home that night, They’re not dealing with the carnage at the scene that we deal with every single day. So our mission, our goal is to get people to drive safer so we have less deaths on the highways of Oklahoma and we have less broken families.”\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

    "News_text":"Time to hit the books.\n\nPrivate markets have the potential for great returns, and they havehistorically outperformedpublic ones. Many advisors steer clear of them, however, partially because of limited knowledge about how they actually work. It’s an information gap many will have to address sooner rather than later.\n\nApollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan believes that allocations to private equity and private credit will make up a third of client portfolios in the near future. “The vast majority of financial advisors may not go to private markets directly, [but] they will buy products that give them access to public and private markets,” he said during a Q&A at the Morningstar Investment Conference last week.\n\nIf advisors are to stay competitive in Rowan’s vision of the future, many are going to need a private markets crash course.\n\nREAD ALSO:States With the Highest AUM Potential Per AdvisorandWhat iCapital’s $820M Funding Means for Private Markets\n\nRight now, advisors allocate an average of just 5% of clients’ portfolios to alternatives, compared with 25% by institutions, according toFidelity. Part of the gap is due to limited access, since private markets are typically restricted toaccredited investors. But unfamiliarity also plays a big role. Private markets are complicated territory.\n\n“You can’t just enter a ticker on a platform and execute transactions,” said Laura Lutton, head of manager research at Morningstar, adding that private market investments often require separate investment platforms and client agreements. “It creates a structural friction that keeps advisors reluctant to get involved,” she told Advisor Upside.\n\nPrivate markets also come with lower liquidity, less transparency, and complex fee structures — challenges that can be difficult to explain to clients. “It sounds simple, but it’s really not,” Lutton said. Morningstar is working to make those conversations easier by expanding itsMedalist Ratingframework later this year to include semiliquid funds, offering more transparency and helping identify strategies likely to outperform certain benchmarks.\n\nWhile, private markets may seem daunting, but advisors don’t have to go it alone:\n\nOne way advisors can become more familiar with private equity and private credit is through sponsors themselves. Major firms like BlackRock, KKR, iCapital and more offer CE credits through alternative investing courses.\n\nThe CFA Institute also offers multiple courses and certifications on private markets.\n\nDo Your Homework.Some advisors are taking the independent study approach, like Alex Caswell of Wealth Script Advisors, who’s been reading books and scholarly articles published in the CFA Institute’s Financial Analysts Journal to understand whether the investments would be right for his clients. So far, he’s not sold on them, especially private credit.\n\n“PC has swallowed up a lot of the fast-and-loose loan and debt origination that was done by banks pre-2008,” he told Advisor Upside. “Now, these PC funds are being shoved into portfolios left and right, and it comes with a lot of unevaluated risks that people aren’t realizing.”\n\nThis post first appeared onThe Daily Upside.

    "News_title":"Death of top Russian oil executive fuels fresh scrutiny of elite's 'window falls'",
    "News_text":"The unexplained death of a topRussian oilexecutive on July 4 is fueling renewed scrutiny over the rising number of high-profile Russian officials and businessmen who have died under mysterious circumstances, specifically, have fallen out of windows.\n\nAndrei Badalov, vice president of Transneft, Russia's largest state-controlled pipeline transport company,diedafter falling from the window of his apartment inMoscow.\n\nRussian state news agency TASS, citing law enforcement sources, claimed the preliminary cause of death was suicide.\n\nWhile Russian authorities often label these falls as suicides or accidents, others suggest something more deliberate may be at play.\n\nIvan Stupak, a Ukrainian military analyst and former security service (SBU) officer, said it's likely that Russia's own security services are behind many such deaths.\n\n\"They can pressure a person in one way or another. It's a well-known tactic — either you kill yourself, and your family is left in peace with what they have, or they start arrests, imprisonments, and leave everyone destitute,\" he told the Kyiv Independent.\n\nSince early 2022, dozens ofRussian businessmen, state officials, and industry leaders have died under questionable circumstances.\n\nWhile many of these cases have officially been labeled as suicides, others involve alleged murder-suicides, mysterious accidents, or unexplained falls.\n\nIn April 2022,Vladislav Avayev, vice president ofGazprombank, one of Russia's largest banks, was found dead in Moscow alongside his wife and daughter. Preliminary findings claimed Avaev shot them before turning the gun on himself.\n\nJust days later, former Novatek gas producer executiveSergei Protosenya, his wife, and daughter were discovered dead at a villa in Spain.\n\nSpanish mediareportedthat Protosenya allegedly killed his family and then hanged himself, though the case remains unresolved.\n\nStupak suggested that not all of the deaths are politically motivated — some may stem from internal business rivalries.\n\n\"Apart from business disputes, it could also be a case of unpaid debts, borrowed money, or even embezzlement,\" he said.\n\nAmong the most striking patterns is the recurrence of deaths caused by \"falling out of a window.\" At least seven such incidents have been reported since 2022.\n\nIn September 2022,Ravil Maganov, chairman of Russia's second-largest oil firmLukoil, died after falling from a hospital window in Moscow.\n\nWhile Lukoil's official obituary cited a \"serious illness,\" state media later reported he had allegedly committed suicide.\n\n\"Either you mysteriously die, or you end up behind bars.\"\n\nThat same year, United Russia lawmakerPavel Antonovwas found dead at a hotel in India, lying in a pool of blood beneath his window.\n\nIndian police said Antonov fell from the third floor, and local mediareportedthat he had been \"depressed\" over the recent death of a friend, who had died in the same hotel days earlier.\n\nMost recently, on Feb. 6, Russian singer-songwriterVadim Stroykindied during a raid by Russian security forces.\n\nHuman rights group OVD-Info reported that Stroykin fell out of a 10th-floor window of hisSt. Petersburgapartment while officers were conducting a search linked to his alleged donation toUkraine's Armed Forces.\n\nRussian media called the death a suicide. Stroykin had previously condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and criticized PresidentVladimir Putindirectly.\n\nPhysically throwing someone out of a window would require at least two people, making it a loud and risky operation. Yet sometimes, the intent may be precisely to send a message, Stupak added.\n\n\"Look at what happened with (Yevgeny)Prigozhin. He could've been poisoned somewhere inAfrica, and they could have easily blamed it on spoiled bananas. But they chose a demonstrative, public execution,\" he said.\n\nWagner Group founder Prigozhin and other Wagner leadersdied in a suspicious plane crashinside Russia in 2023. The crash came two months after Prigozhin led a brief rebellion against the Kremlin.\n\n\"So, this could be a warning to others, showing what happens if you don't pay your debts, refuse to hand over business shares, or go against Putin,\" he added.\n\nIn Russia's system, even high-ranking officials aren't safe from internal purges.\n\n\"Just recall the case ofTimur Ivanov, Russia's deputy defense minister,\" Stupak said. \"He's a Hero of Russia. Yet he was imprisoned, everything was confiscated, and his family was left with nothing.\"\n\nOn July 1, Ivanov wassentencedto 13 years in a penal colony for bribery and embezzlement, the harshest punishment handed down in a recent wave ofcorruptioncases targeting senior defense officials.\n\n\"This shows just how ruthless the regime can be,\" he said. \"Either you mysteriously die, or you end up behind bars.\"\n\nStupak believes the trend will only continue, driven by infighting and shrinking economic opportunity.\n\n\"There are noWestern companiesleft, and domestic business is stagnating. Not every business group can boast of keeping up its volumes,\" he said.\n\n\"Those who refuse to cooperate,\" he said, \"end up either in prison or out the window.\"\n\nHi, this is Tim.

    "News_title":"US Teen Drivers Admit to Looking at Their Phones For 21% of Every Trip",
    "News_text":"A survey of more than 1,000 American teen drivers has found they spend about 21 percent of each drive looking at their phones. This is despite the majority of states in the US banningall types of phone usagefor young drivers.\n\nThe research team, including scientists from Harvard University, began by interviewing 20 high school students with driver licenses about their attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control on the road.\n\nStudents from suburban and rural areas in Northeast and Western states were specifically recruited, because these teenagers were more likely to drive than those in cities.\n\nIn this group, about 70 percent admitted to spending some time looking at their phone while driving. The most common reason for this dangerous distraction? Entertainment, accounting for 65 percent of mobile phone use behind the wheel, followed by texting (40 percent) and navigation (30 percent).\n\nRelated:A 'Silent Epidemic on Wheels' Is Killing Us, And We Need to Talk About It\n\nThese teenagers explained that phone use was often motivated by \"communication with family and friends\", \"being productive\", and \"being entertained while driving\". They were aware of the accident risk and reduced visibility, and felt that keeping their phone out of reach, using ahands-free device, andbeing well-restedimproved their behavioral control.\n\nWhile participants acknowledged that the important people in their lives would not want them driving distracted, they believed their friends and family did it too, which suggests the behavior is widely normalized (and the importance of setting a good example, mom and dad).\n\nTheir responses allowed the researchers to put together a 38-question survey that they took to a further 1,126 high school-age drivers (18 years old on average) from suburban and rural areas around the US.\n\nThis was when they found that young drivers spent an average of 21.1 percent of their time on the road looking at a phone. Around 26.5 percent of these glances were estimated to last longer than two seconds, a duration that puts drivers at5.5 times greater risk of a crash.\n\n\"We found that while young drivers recognize the advantages of using smartphone features like GPS, they also understand the heightened risk of accidents associated with distracted driving,\"sayslead author Rebecca Robbins, a behavioral scientist from Mass General Brigham.\n\n\"Encouraging the use of 'Do Not Disturb' mode, keeping phones out of reach, and ensuring teens get adequate sleep are effective strategies to mitigate this dangerous behavior.\"\n\nWhile the blanket ban on phone use while driving seems straightforward, it's obviously not a foolproof solution. Robbins and teambelievethat if we want to address the serious issue of distracted driving among young people, it is imperative to understand the \"predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors to this risky behavior.\"\n\nWhile the survey's results are not necessarily representative of the wider population in the US or around the world, this concerning snapshot points to some practical approaches to making our roads safer.\n\nFor instance, one of the strongest beliefs these teenagers held was that distracted driving could afford them the ability to \"be productive\". The team suggests campaignsdebunking this beliefcould be an effective approach.\n\n\"Distracted driving is a serious public health threat and particularly concerning among young drivers. Driving distracted doesn't just put the driver at risk of injury or death, it puts everyone else on the road in danger of an accident,\" Robbinssays.\n\nThis research was published inTraffic Injury Prevention.\n\nOldest Egyptian DNA Reveals Secrets of Elite Potter From Pyramid Era\n\nZapping Volunteers' Brains With Electricity Boosted Their Maths Skills\n\nRuins of Ancient Temple Belonged to Mysterious Pre-Inca Civilization",

(KGET) — During a drunken argument with his ex-girlfriend in May, Roman Bernal made a startling confession: he’d hit and killed a pedestrian with his car five years earlier.\n\nHis ex told him to call police and turn himself in — or she would.\n\nIn response, Bernal grabbed a cord and threatened to strangle her, the ex told police. He said he’d cut her into pieces and leave her remains in the mountains, she said according to reports filed in Superior Court.\n\nThere was a scuffle, she said, after which she called authorities.\n\nThat call led to Bernal’s arrest days later. He admitted to hitting the pedestrian and afterward repairing his Subaru Impreza to avoid getting caught, the reports say.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bernal, 28, pleaded no contest to charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and hit-and-run causing death. Charges of dissuading a witness by threats and concealing evidence were dismissed.\n\nProsecutors say he faces two years in prison. Sentencing is set for July 30.\n\nThe crash occurred the night of July 19, 2020, at the intersection of Chester and California avenues. Police arrived to find a man dead and the vehicle that hit him gone.\n\nInvestigators located video showing a car leaving the crash scene. They sent out a press release featuring photos of the car and a paint chip recovered from the scene.\n\nNo one came forward. Years passed with no leads.\n\nThen Bernal’s ex called.\n\nDetectives interviewed her and examined photos she had of the Subaru taken before the crash.\n\nBernal was arrested and interviewed.

    "News_title":"No, Black people may not be joining all of your protests. But they are still resisting",
    "News_text":"Monica Wilson was so devastated by the result of the 2024 presidential election, she couldn’t even move the day after. She had cast her ballot for Vice PresidentKamala Harrisbut became disillusioned when she learned a plurality of Americans ultimately choseDonald Trump.\n\n“I actually was one of those Black women that said, ‘To hell with it. You do what you want. It’s your issue. You created it,’” Wilson, who serves as a Parma, Ohio, city councilwoman, recalled in a phone interview.\n\nWilson wasn’t alone in her anger.Black voterscarried the Democratic vote in 2024, voting for Harris at 83%, split between 89% of Black women and 75% of Black men, according to a2025 Pew Research Center report. When Harris lost to Trump,members of those majoritiesdeclared that they would not participate in any and all anti-Trump protests. But just under six months into Trump’s presidency, that declaration hasn’t exactly translated to inaction.\n\nIn Wilson’s case, that meant having a “change of heart” just three months in.\n\n“Somewhere around March or so, I said I need to start participating because this is my life, and it is the life of my legacies — my nieces and nephews — and it’s my country,” said Wilson, who added that attending the nationwide “Hands Off” protest in early April made her come out of her post-election slump.\n\nHarris’ ascension to the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket last summer reenergized die-hard Black Democrats in ways unseen since former President Barack Obama’s 2008 bid, with fundraising calls raking in millions of dollars for Harris’ fledgling campaign in the weeks immediately after then–President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. That momentum, coupled with the hope that the country would put its first Black and South Asian woman in the Oval Office, reinvigorated Black voters in a moment when it felt like the nation’s future again hung in the balance — and that made Harris’ loss that much more crushing a betrayal.\n\nIn the days post-election, social media was flooded with statements from Black users, particularly Black women, that they would be sitting out of protests and marches against the Trump administration. They’d done their part by turning out to vote and organizing for democracy, many said, and it would be on everyone else to dig themselves out of the inevitable social, economic and political hole Trump 2.0 would bring.\n\n“I want people to understand how angry Black women are, and quite honestly, Black men,” Wilson said, voicing frustration over the narrative that Black men shifted toward Trump. (Pew’s post-election data indicates that Trump’s support among Black voters nearly doubled between 2024 and 2020, going from 8% to 15%).\n\n“We have been out here, for the 20th and 19th centuries, leading the protest to get America to live and fulfill its promise, and we just got the wind knocked out of us this last election,” she added. “The majority have, if not more, responsibility to fight back because they brought this down upon us. They voted for this man, and they created the institutions of racism, they have cultivated the institution of prejudices and inequality, and they have to take responsibility for that.”\n\nThat commitment to sitting out — abstaining from anti-Trump demonstrations in favor of staying home — was apparent in the “Hands Off” protests against the administration.Reportsnotedthat crowds were largely made up of older white people, pointing tophotosfrom the actions across the country as evidence.That was in contrast with the diverse, Black-led protests that erupted in 2020 and galvanized thousands of Americans against police brutality and anti-Black racism.\n\nBrandon Jessup, deputy director of data analytics and movement technology at State Voices, has witnessed that disillusionment among Black Americans firsthand. While door-knocking and doing outreach for the nonpartisan civic engagement network, State Voices organizers have faced a higher level of scrutiny from Black communities, he said in a phone interview.\n\nMany are still interested in taking to the streets, as with the “No Kings” demonstrations in June. But many others, Jessup said, are skeptical of how they can continue to voice their opposition to the current administrationwhen it’s upending their lives; they’re bearing the brunt of Trump’s executive actions and legislation targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, Medicaid and other social services as well as navigating the disappointment of decades of fighting to only obtain marginal reform.\n\n“Incremental change — that’s almost water torture, especially when our communities desire radical change, not extreme change,” Jessup told Salon. “What we’re getting from this current administration is extremism. We wanted radical change. We wanted a change that made sure that we took care of all, not less.”\n\nStacy Davis Gates, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, told Salon that she sees many Black women still grappling with that “rejection,” both in terms of Harris’ candidacy and the fact that some members of their communities voted for Trump “even at the peril of their own family.” Still, Davis Gates argued, it’s not clear that Black people could abstain even if they wanted to.\n\n“One of the things that popular discourse often misses is that being Black is a political strategy within itself,” she told Salon. “From the time that we wake up to the time that we go to sleep, in the way that we have to navigate society at our jobs, in our schools, in our neighborhood, even a trip to the grocery store … I don’t think we ever truly sit out of any protest.”\n\nMarcus Anthony Hunter, professor of sociology and African American Studies at UCLA, echoed that sentiment. Black people, he added, also must weigh the risk of engaging in demonstrations and the potential for violent encounters with law enforcementagainst their safety and livelihoods.\n\n“There’s a calculation that is worth considering, and it sometimes means people throw that out the window and just jump out there,” said Hunter, whocoinedthe #BlackLivesMatter hashtag in 2012 before it ballooned into a movement. “But just because you don’t see them doesn’t mean they’re not caring, and that they don’t care and that they’re not doing things that raise the alarms in their communities in ways that might be less seen or less visible, but are still very much present.”\n\nSuch is the case for Meredith Turner, a Cuyahoga County councilwoman and 2024 Ohio delegate at the Democratic National Convention. Shepreviously told Salonthat, following Harris’ loss, she would not be participating in any protests or marches against the then-incoming president for the foreseeable future. Months later, she said she remains steadfast in that commitment.\n\n“I feel like the coalition that I belong to — we’re tired. We’re tired. It’s OK for us to sit back and watch others strategize and take action,” Turner said. She added that she’s “very comfortable” withTrump supporters and Americans who didn’t vote“having to deal with the consequences of their decisions.”\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.Sign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nBut choosing to sit out doesn’t mean disengaging from the fight for democracy altogether. Turner said she’s focused on lobbying for change at the state and local levels, advocating for her constituents and participating in letter-writing campaigns appealing to state and federal Ohio officials to challenge cuts to the safety net.\n\n“I may not be marching in the street, but I’m fully engaged where I believe I can make the most impact,” Turner said.\n\nMeanwhile, she said she and others are turning inward to their communities to partner with local organizations, brainstorm ways to fill the gaps, cultivate Black leadership and prioritize Black joy.\n\n“We are dealing with this in a totally different way,” Turner said. “We are having cookouts. We got our boots on the ground. We’re line dancing. We’re going about our daily life. We’re having cotillions. We’re having graduation parties. We’re trying to get the next generation engaged because we just may not be able to do anything right now.”\n\nBlack Americans’ resistance to Trump’s policies has also taken the form of boycotts and investing more in Black-owned and pro-DEI businesses. A handful of Black-led groups, spearheaded by Atlanta-basedPastor Jamal Bryant, launched a boycott of Target after the retailer announced in January that it would be sunsetting a program it started after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 aimed at helping Black employees develop their careers, boost Black-owned businesses and improve Black shoppers’ experiences. The change followed Trump’s issuance of an executive order targeting DEI in the federal government and encouraging rollbacks in the private sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Costco’s renewed commitment to DEI in the face of Trump’s policies led Rev. Al Sharpton to orchestratea buy-inat the Washington state wholesaler with more than 100 members of the National Action Network.\n\nWhile it’s unclear the exact impact the boycott has had, so far this year Target’s foot traffic has slowed, stock prices have plunged andnet quarterly sales have decreasedcompared to 2024 numbers. At the same time, Black and Hispanic households appeared to be pulling back visits at a disproportionately high rate in the weeks following Target’s DEI rollback, according to a MarchNumerator report. In contrast, the report said, Costco “attracted many of these same consumers” and saw a 7.7 million increase in visits over a four-week period that ended Feb. 9.\n\nYusuf Johnson counted himself among those new Costco visitors this year, going so far as to purchase a membership and tell his store’s staff his reasons for doing so. While the Florida-based IT project manager said he was never one for participating in demonstrations, in part, due to the danger of police encounters that Black men face, he has always tried to resist through spreading knowledge in blogs, social media posts and more recently, creating YouTube videos.\n\n“I think if you’re not going to be on the streets, you should be ridiculously vocal,” Johnson said, arguing that actions without explanations are “not good enough.” He also said he worries that online calls to “sit out” will lead to more people disengaging from resistance and politics altogether in favor of placing the onus squarely on white Americans. Maybe abstaining while calling on white people to get involved can work, he added. “But if it turns into people just simply shutting down from any form of gaining knowledge, … [of] current events, then I think it’s going to be damaging to us.”\n\nJohnson’s longtime friend, Angelina Hamilton Steiner, on the other hand, occupies something of a middle ground. The founder of Madison Court Community Coalition, a grassroots youth engagement organization in Lakewood, Ohio, told Salon she understands and respects Black Americans’ decision to pull back from the frontlines of activism, having come out of the election feeling “dejected” herself. Still, she said, she knew she had to do something.\n\n“I am still wanting to keep fighting. I’m not wanting to give up hope because, for me, this is just as much my country as it is their country,” she said.\n\nHer solution has been to focus on the local level and work to alleviate the manifestations of federal policies on everyday people. She applied to be appointed to the vacant seat on the Lakewood, Ohio, city council and was selected to fill the role in January. She’s also taken part in a few Cleveland-area protests, though she said she’s engaging in demonstrations at a much slower pace than she had before the election.\n\nHow to approach resistance going forward, she said, is a decision that every Black American needs to make for themselves, regardless of what others think.\n\n“I think this is on the white collective to get out there and save your country and be at these protests and put your bodies out there on the front line,” Hamilton Steiner added. “Our bodies have been on the frontline since this country was founded and have founded this country.”\n\nThe postNo, Black people may not be joining all of your protests.

    "News_title":"Trump and Netanyahu are heading for an Oval Office showdown",
    "News_text":"Bibi Netanyahu’s Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump on Monday could be a game-changer. They will undoubtedly focus on Iran, Gaza, and Syria’s new regime among other subjects. But how close are the two leaders’ positions, and can their differences be reconciled?\n\nBoth will declare the meeting “successful,” but the reality may be quite different. Trump crossed a Rubicon by ordering direct US militaryaction against nuclear-weapons-related targets in Iran. He may think the strikes were simply a “one and done” affair, but, if so, he is badly mistaken. Trump put his personal prestige on the line, not to mention America’s. Despite his contention that the B-2 bunker-buster raids “completely and totally obliterated” the targeted nuclear-program sites, much remains to be done.\n\nNo one knows that better than Netanyahu, who hasfocused on the Iranian nuclear threat for over three decades. Although he persuaded (or manoeuvred) Trump into using military force, the US President swerved immediately after receiving favourable reports on the strikes to impose a cease-fire on Israel and Iran.\n\nNetanyahu had little choice but to stand down, having achieved two major objectives: getting Trump into the fight andimposing significant, albeit not fatal, damage on Iran’s nuclear project. Iran also had little choice, having been pounded by Israel and the US, but to launch merely pro forma retaliation, shake its rhetorical fist in defiance, and hope to escape any additional destruction.\n\nNonetheless, Netanyahu sees that the time is ripe for further action against Iran, including actions to encourage the domestic opposition to move against the ayatollahs. Iran’s air defences are now essentially flat, but the moment will not last forever. Top Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists have been eliminated, but their ranks will reform, and their respective work will resume. The ayatollahs have clearly signalled their continuing resolve by effectively expelling all International Atomic Energy Agency personnel from the country.\n\nThe last thing Netanyahu wants is for Trump to throw Tehran an economic or political lifeline. Israel seeks regime change in Iran, and Netanyahu needs at least Trump’s acquiescence for Israel to continue deconstructing the remains of Iran’s nuclear enterprise. Further US participation would be icing on the cake. By contrast, Trump desperately wants a Nobel Peace Prize. After all, he reasons, Barack Obama received one (which he didn’t deserve), so why not Trump?\n\nTrump’s Nobel obsessionnow seems concentrated on Gaza, where the ongoing conflict has intensified since the Israel-Iran ceasefire took effect. He has pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach agreement to effect the return some still-unsettled number of Israeli hostages and remains, in exchange releasing possibly 1,000 Hamas prisoners in Israeli custody, plus a 60-day ceasefire. The sticking point remains Hamas’s insistence on a complete end to the war, or, reportedly, a commitment that talks to end the war commence immediately after the hostage\/prisoner exchanges.\n\nThis sort of framework has been used before, but its durability remains just as doubtful as other post-October 7, 2023 efforts. Trump wants to announce a cease-fire on or before the Monday meeting, but how long it lasts is anyone’s guess. Hamas undoubtedly wants relief from Israeli military strikes, and domestic political pressure to secure the release of more hostages has left Netanyahu little manoeuvring room. But, apart from humanitarian objectives regarding the hostages, Israel gains no strategic upside from yet another cease fire. Israel has repeatedly suspended combat operations and withdrawn from already-secured positions in Gaza, and then been forced to re-take them, at considerable human and material costs to the Israeli Defense Forces. Lengthening the war also imposes additional strains on an already stressed Israeli economy.\n\nThe collapse of Syria’s Assad regime, replaced by former Al-Nusra Front terrorists (now known as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, or “HTS”), was undoubtedly a serious setback for Iran. Acceding to Saudi Arabia’s requests, Trumplifted US economic sanctions previously imposed against Assad’s government, but substantial questions remain whether HTS has actually renounced terrorism.\n\nIts leader, Syria’s de facto head of government, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is also an unknown, having shed his combat fatigues for a suit, trimmed his beard, and dropped his nom de guerre for, apparently, his real name. In the meantime, Israel continues military operations inside Syria, in addition to holding onto an extended buffer zone occupied after Assad’s fall.\n\nPerhaps nothing concrete regarding Syria will emerge from the Netanyahu-Trump meeting, but the two leaders need a better sense of each other’s concerns and objectives. Since the First World War, the Middle East has seen more diplomatic efforts crash and burn than any other geographic hot spot. Iran and Gaza today are unlikely to prove more successful.\n\nMonday’s most important outcome in the West Wing will be decisions on the possible further use of US and Israeli military force to achieve key objectives on both fronts.\n\nJohn Bolton is a former US National Security Adviser\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

    "News_title":"Starmer’s Government is grossly naive about the threat posed by China",
    "News_text":"The Labour government’s China policy is a shambles. It did not list China as a top threat under its new foreign-influence rules – even though the government admits that China has undermined Britain’s economic security and engaged in espionage and acts intended to undermine democracy.\n\nThe government’s failure to apply these rules means that China, and China-controlled entities, do not have to register their activities with the British government.\n\nThose who lobbied against designating China as a top-tier threat argued that it would have a chilling effect on closer economic ties. The China lobby carried the day. It’s part of a pattern that sees London determined not to offend China ahead of Keir Starmer’s rumoured trip to Beijing later this year.\n\n“China will continue to play a vital role in supporting the UK’s secure growth,” David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said last week in a speech announcing the country’s new engagement policy, the China Audit, tucked inside the UK’s National Security Strategy.\n\nThe governmentseems set on emulating the “golden years,”when David Cameron and China’s leader Xi Jinpingshared a pint at a British pub, even as the danger posed by China grows more pronounced.\n\n“Cooperate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must,” coos Labour, but there’s little challenge. Why has Labour gone off the rails with its China policy?\n\nStarmer’s background as a human rights lawyer and Labour’s historical concern for human rights have fallen victim to a mistaken belief that China will somehow save the British economy.\n\nStarmer is right to focus on economic growth. But he’s looking for it in the wrong place. Despite being the world’s second-largest economy, China registers below France as a British trading partner, and remains an insignificant investor.\n\nChina dominates trade between the two countries, with its almost £70 billion exports to Britain, more than double the £29.7 billion Britain sends to the People’s Republic.\n\nBritain’s exports to China fell by £3.8 billion, or 12 per cent, in 2024 and accounted for only 3.4 per cent of the country’s shipments abroad. The EU and US made up 63.8 per cent of the total. The investment picture is even less promising, with Sino-British investments well under one percent of total investments.\n\nWith its economy faltering under a sustained property crash, China hardly seems like the market of the future, notwithstanding the boasts of Rachel Reeves, who says she signed deals during a trip to Beijing in January that would bring an additional £600 million in benefits to Britain over the next five years.\n\nBritain has proven unwilling or unable to hold China to account for breaching its treaty obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Britain handed Hong Kong to China in exchange for a promise that the colony would enjoy its tradition of freedom and would be protected by the common-law system. China shredded that agreement. In the five years since Beijing imposed a vague and sweeping National Security Law on the city, nearly 2,000 people have been jailed on political charges. Newspapers have been forcibly shuttered, and the last remaining pro-democracy party this week announced it has been forced to disband.\n\nJimmy Lai, a newspaper publisher andBritish citizen, remains in solitary confinementin Hong Kong, jailed for more than 1,600 days because of his commitment to free speech and his desire to uphold the values that Britain bequeathed to its former colony. British diplomats have not even been able to meet with Mr Lai to provide consular access.\n\nIn London, officials prepare to approve a mega-embassy, China’s largest diplomatic outpost in Europe, despite opposition ranging from London residents to US politicians. The irony is that this will do little for the economy all while undermining the very national security that it’s designed to protect.\n\nDuring her trip to Beijing in January, Rachel Reeves published an opinion piece in The Times titled, “Choosing not to engage with China is no choice at all.” That’s setting up a strawman. No one issuggesting that engagement with China should be cut off. But engagement should uphold the British values of freedom, liberty, and the rule of law rather than rewarding China for its lawless behaviour.\n\nMark Clifford is president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation and the author of a biography of Jimmy Lai.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
