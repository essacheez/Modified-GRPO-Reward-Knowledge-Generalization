    "\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"QUESTION GENERATOR PROMPT\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a question generator. Given an atomic fact, generate a question that can be answered solely using the information in that fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT CONTEXT: All atomic facts are NEWS EVENTS - surprising, tragic, or unprecedented occurrences. These are not routine announcements or expected publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL: Do NOT automatically include dates just because they appear in the fact. Even for news events, dates should ONLY be included when necessary to distinguish between multiple similar events.\n",
    "\n",
    "REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SELF-CONTAINED\n",
    "- The question must be answerable using ONLY the atomic fact\n",
    "- No external knowledge, context, or details should be needed\n",
    "- If someone reads only the fact, they should be able to answer the question completely\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SPECIFIC AND UNAMBIGUOUS\n",
    "- Include enough detail to prevent confusion with other events\n",
    "- Use specific names, locations, or numbers from the fact\n",
    "- Ensure the question cannot be mistaken for asking about generic information or previous occurrences\n",
    "- The question should clearly reference the unique circumstances in the fact\n",
    "\n",
    "3. STRATEGIC USE OF DATES FOR NEWS EVENTS (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT)\n",
    "\n",
    "BEFORE including any date, ask yourself this question:\n",
    "\"Would someone confuse this with a DIFFERENT similar news event if I removed the date?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For news events, apply this framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "INCLUDE dates for:\n",
    "✓ Recurring natural disasters from active locations (earthquakes in California, hurricanes in Florida, Mount Etna eruptions)\n",
    "✓ Ongoing crisis updates where numbers/status change (death tolls, evacuations, \"as of [date]\" statements)\n",
    "✓ Periodic statistics in news (monthly job reports, quarterly GDP, weekly unemployment)\n",
    "✓ Multiple similar incidents in the same area/type (shootings, accidents, protests)\n",
    "✓ Breaking developments in ongoing stories where the same entity makes multiple announcements\n",
    "\n",
    "DO NOT include dates for:\n",
    "✗ First-time unprecedented events (specific person's unique controversial action, novel policy announcements)\n",
    "✗ Unique lawsuits (specific plaintiff + specific defendant + specific claim = already unique)\n",
    "✗ One-time product/feature launches (specific platform + specific feature name = already unique)\n",
    "✗ Singular appointments or resignations (specific person to specific position = already unique)\n",
    "✗ Book releases about news events (specific author + specific title = already unique, even if responding to current events)\n",
    "✗ Single-occurrence tragedies with unique circumstances (specific location + specific type of incident = already unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY PRINCIPLE FOR NEWS:\n",
    "Even surprising news can be unique without dates. Ask: \"Has this SPECIFIC combination of people/places/actions happened before or could happen again?\" If no, omit the date.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DIRECT ANSWER\n",
    "- Provide the answer after generating the question\n",
    "- The answer must be directly extractable from the fact\n",
    "- Do not infer or add information not present in the fact\n",
    "- Provide complete, detailed answers that include relevant context from the fact\n",
    "- Match the temporal specificity of the question (if question has no date, minimize date emphasis in answer)\n",

    "\n",
    "DECISION PROCESS:\n",
    "- Mount Etna is a highly active volcano with frequent eruptions\n",
    "- Sicily experiences multiple volcanic events from Etna each year\n",
    "- Without date: \"Mount Etna eruption\" could refer to dozens of events\n",
    "- This is recurring news from the same location\n",
    "- DATE IS REQUIRED\n",

    "- This is an ongoing volcanic crisis\n",
    "- Airport status changes day by day\n",
    "- \"As of\" explicitly signals temporal dependency\n",
    "- The same airport could have different statuses on different days during the crisis\n",
