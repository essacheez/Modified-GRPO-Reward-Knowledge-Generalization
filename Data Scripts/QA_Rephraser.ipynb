    "   prompt = f\"\"\"You are a professional question rephraser specializing in generating lexically diverse variations. Your task is to produce **6 maximally divergent** rephrasings of the input question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORE INSTRUCTIONS FOR MINIMAL OVERLAP\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Preserve Intent:** Each rephrasing must maintain the **exact original meaning, specificity, and scope**. Do not add, remove, or change information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Maximize Lexical Distance:**\n",
    "    * **Goal:** Achieve the lowest possible Jaccard Similarity score (lexical overlap) across all seven questions (Original + 6 Variants).\n",
    "    * **Prohibited:** Do not use the same content word (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) more than **once** across all 6 rephrased versions, even if it's a synonym.\n",
    "    * **Essential Term Handling:** Proper nouns, named entities, dates, and numbers must be preserved, but **must be textually transformed** using alternatives like:\n",
    "        * **Dates:** Use *ordinal numbers* (e.g., \"the 16th of July\"), *written-out numbers* (e.g., \"July sixteenth\"), or *alternative formats* (e.g., \"7/16/2025\").\n",
    "        * **Numbers:** Use *written-out words* (e.g., \"seven point three\"), *fractions* (e.g., \"seven and three-tenths\"), or *technical abbreviations* (e.g., \"M7.3\").\n",
    "        * **Locations:** Use *hypernyms* (e.g., \"tri-state area,\" \"the region\") or *abbreviations* (e.g., \"MI, OH, PA\").\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Structural Transformation:**\n",
    "    * Vary the core grammatical structure for **every** version. Use: passive voice, nominalization (converting a verb to a noun, e.g., \"analyze\" $\\to$ \"analysis\"), embedded clauses, and rhetorical devices.\n",
    "    * Change the interrogative word (Who, What, Where, How, Describe, Identify) for **at least four** of the six versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Natural Language Quality:** Each question must be highly fluent, professional, and grammatically impeccable. Avoid any awkward or forced substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DIVERSITY GUARANTEE CHECK\n",
    "\n",
    "Before outputting, confirm that:\n",
    "1.  All 6 versions use distinct starting words/phrases.\n",
    "2.  The set of content words (non-stopwords) in version 1 is almost entirely disjoint from the set of content words in version 2, and so on.\n",
